      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mailing of important information about drugs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Manufacturers and distributors of drugs and the Food and Drug Administration occasionally are required to mail important information about drugs to physicians and others responsible for patient care. In the public interest, such mail should be distinctive in appearance so that it will be promptly recognized and read. The Food and Drug Administration will make such mailings in accordance with the specifications set forth in this section. Manufacturers and distributors of drugs are asked to make such mailings as prescribed by this section and not to use the distinctive envelopes for ordinary mail.</P>
              <P>(a) Use first class mail and No. 10 white envelopes.</P>
              <P>(b) The name and address of the agency or the drug manufacturer or distributor is to appear in the upper left corner of the envelope.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Supplying pharmacists with indications and dosage information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>There are presently no regulations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that prevent a manufacturer of prescription drugs from sending the pharmacist data he needs on indications and dosage in exercising his important professional function of checking against possible mistakes in a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration believes manufacturers should be encouraged to supply such printed matter to the pharmacist for his professional information. Obviously, such printed matter should not be displayed to prospective purchasers to promote over-the-counter sale of prescription drugs.</P>

              <P>(a) Section 704(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act specifically authorizes inspection of consulting laboratories as well as any factory, warehouse, or establishment in which prescription drugs are manufactured, processed, packed, or held.</P>
              <P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration is aware that many manufacturers of pharmaceutical products utilize extramural independent contract facilities, such as testing laboratories, contract packers or labelers, and custom grinders, and regards extramural facilities as an extension of the manufacturer's own facility.</P>
              <P>(c) The Food and Drug Administration reserves the right to disclose to the pharmaceutical manufacturer, or to the applicant of a new drug application (NDA) or to the sponsor of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application, any information obtained during the inspection of an extramural facility having a specific bearing on the compliance of the manufacturer's, applicant's, or sponsor's product with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Food and Drug Administration's position is that by the acceptance of such contract work, the extramural facility authorizes such disclosures.</P>
              <P>(d) The Food and Drug Administration does not consider results of validation studies of analytical and assay methods and control procedures to be trade secrets that may be withheld from the drug manufacturer by the contracted extramural facility.</P>

              <P>For purposes of sections 801 and 802 of the act and this title, the term <E T="03">insulin</E> means the active principle of the pancreas that affects the metabolism of carbohydrates in the animal body and which is of value in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The term includes synthetic and biotechnologically derived products that are the same as, or similar to, naturally occurring insulins in structure, use, and intended effect and are of value in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Ophthalmic preparations and dispensers.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a)(1) Informed medical opinion is in agreement that all preparations offered <PRTPAGE P="7"/>or intended for ophthalmic use, including preparations for cleansing the eyes, should be sterile. It is further evident that such preparations purport to be of such purity and quality as to be suitable for safe use in the eye.</P>
              <P>(2) The Food and Drug Administration concludes that all such preparations, if they are not sterile, fall below their professed standard of purity or quality and may be unsafe. In a statement of policy issued on September 1, 1964, the Food and Drug Administration ruled that liquid preparations offered or intended for ophthalmic use that are not sterile may be regarded as adulterated within the meaning of section 501(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), and, further, may be deemed misbranded within the meaning of section 502(j) of the act. This ruling is extended to affect all preparations for ophthalmic use. By this regulation, this ruling is applicable to ophthalmic preparations that are regulated as drugs. By the regulation in § 800.10 of this chapter, this ruling is applicable to ophthalmic preparations that are regulated as medical devices.</P>
              <P>(3) The containers of ophthalmic preparations shall be sterile at the time of filling and closing, and the container or individual carton shall be so sealed that the contents cannot be used without destroying the seal. The packaging and labeling of ophthalmic preparations that are over-the-counter drugs shall also comply with § 211.132 of this chapter on tamper-resistant packaging requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) Liquid ophthalmic preparations packed in multiple-dose containers should:</P>
              <P>(1) Contain one or more suitable and harmless substances that will inhibit the growth of microorganisms; or</P>
              <P>(2) Be so packaged as to volume and type of container and so labeled as to duration of use and with such necessary warnings as to afford adequate protection and minimize the hazard of injury resulting from contamination during use.</P>
              <P>(c) Eye cups, eye droppers, and other dispensers intended for ophthalmic use should be sterile, and may be regarded as falling below their professed standard of purity or quality if they are not sterile. These articles, which are regulated as drugs if packaged with the drugs with which they are to be used, should be packaged so as to maintain sterility until the package is opened and be labeled, on or within the retail package, so as to afford adequate directions and necessary warnings to minimize the hazard of injury resulting from contamination during use.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prescription drugs; reminder advertisements and reminder labeling to provide price information to consumers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Prescription drug reminder advertisements and reminder labeling intended to provide price information to consumers are exempt from the requirements of §§ 201 .100 and 202.1 of this chapter if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The only purpose of the reminder advertisement or reminder labeling is to provide consumers with information concerning the price charged for a prescription for a particular drug product, and the reminder advertisement or reminder labeling contains no representation or suggestion concerning the drug product's safety, effectiveness, or indications for use.</P>

              <P>(2) The reminder advertisement or reminder labeling contains the proprietary name of the drug product, if any; the established (generic) name of the drug product, if any; the drug product's strength if the product contains a single active ingredient or if the product contains more than one active ingredient and a relevant strength can be <PRTPAGE P="8"/>associated with the product without indicating each active ingredient (the established name and quantity of each active ingredient are not required); the dosage form; and the price charged for a prescription for a specific quantity of the drug product.</P>

              <P>(3) The reminder advertisement or reminder labeling may also include other written, printed, or graphic matter, e.g., identification of professional or convenience services provided by the pharmacy: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such information is neither false nor misleading and contains no representation or suggestion concerning the drug product's safety, effectiveness, or indications for use.</P>
              <P>(4) The price stated in the reminder advertisement or reminder labeling as that charged for a prescription shall include all charges to the consumer including, but not limited to, the cost of the drug product, professional fees, and handling fees, if any. Mailing fees and delivery fees, if any, may be stated separately and without repetition.</P>
              <P>(b) This exemption from §§ 201.100 and 202.1 of this chapter is applicable to all prescription drug reminder labeling and reminder advertisements solely intended to provide consumers with information regarding the price charged for prescriptions including price lists, catalogs, and other promotional material, whether mailed, posted in a pharmacy, placed in a newspaper, or aired on radio or television.</P>
              <P>(c) Any reminder advertisement or reminder labeling intended to provide consumers with prescription price information which is not in compliance with this section shall be the subject of appropriate regulatory action. Such action may be taken against the product and/or the responsible person.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 201.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Drugs; name and place of business of manufacturer, packer, or distributor.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A drug or drug product (as defined in § 320.1 of this chapter) in finished package form is misbranded under section 502 (a) and (b)(1) of the act if its label does not bear conspicuously the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor. This paragraph does not apply to any drug or drug product dispensed in accordance with section 503(b)(1) of the act.<PRTPAGE P="10"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) As used in this section, and for purposes of section 502 (a) and (b)(1) of the act, the manufacturer of a drug product is the person who performs all of the following operations that are required to produce the product: (1) Mixing, (2) granulating, (3) milling, (4) molding, (5) lyophilizing, (6) tableting, (7) encapsulating, (8) coating, (9) sterilizing, and (10) filling sterile, aerosol, or gaseous drugs into dispensing containers.</P>
              <P>(c) If no person performs all of the applicable operations listed in paragraph (b) of this section, no person may be represented as manufacturer except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the person performs more than one half of the applicable operations listed in paragraph (b) of this section and acknowledges the contribution of other persons who have performed the remaining applicable operations by stating on the product label that “Certain manufacturing operations have been performed by other firms.”; or</P>
              <P>(2) If the person performs at least one applicable operation listed in paragraph (b) of this section and identifies by appropriate designation all other persons who have performed the remaining applicable operations, e.g., “Made by (Person A), Filled by (Person B), Sterilized by (Person C)”; or</P>
              <P>(3) If the person performs at least one applicable operation listed in paragraph (b) of this section and the person is listed along with all other persons who have performed the remaining applicable operations as “joint manufacturers.” A list of joint manufacturers shall be qualified by the phrase “Jointly Manufactured By ______,” and the names of all of the manufacturers shall be printed together in the same type size and style; or</P>
              <P>(4) If the person performs all applicable operations listed in paragraph (b) of this section except for those operations listed in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, person, when it identifies a corporation, includes a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and control.</P>
              <P>(d) The Food and Drug Administration finds that it is the common practice in the drug industry to contract out the performance of certain manufacturing operations listed in paragraph (b) of this section. These operations include: (1) Soft-gelatin encapsulating, (2) aerosol filling, (3) sterilizing by irradiation, (4) lyophilizing, and (5) ethylene oxide sterilization.</P>
              <P>(e) A person performs an operation listed in paragraph (b) of this section only if the operation is performed, including the performance of the appropriate in-process quality control operations, except laboratory testing of samples taken during processing, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) By individuals, a majority of whom are employees of the person and, throughout the performance of the operation, are subject to the person's direction and control;</P>
              <P>(2) On premises that are continuously owned or leased by the person and subject to the person's direction and control; and</P>
              <P>(3) On equipment that is continuously owned or leased by the person. As used in this paragraph, person, when it identifies a corporation, includes a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and control.</P>
              <P>(f) The name of the person represented as manufacturer under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must be the same as either (1) the name of the establishment (as defined in § 207.1 of this chapter) under which that person is registered at the time the labeled product is produced or (2) the registered establishment name of a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and control. In addition, the name shall meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.</P>

              <P>(g) The requirement for declaration of the name of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall be deemed to be satisfied, in the case of a corporate person, only by the actual corporate name, except that the corporate name may be the name of a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and control. The corporate name may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of <PRTPAGE P="11"/>the corporation. “Company,” “Incorporated,” etc., may be abbreviated or omitted and “The” may be omitted. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Except as provided in this section, no person other than the manufacturer, packer, or distributor may be identified on the label of a drug or drug product.</P>
              <P>(2) The appearance on a drug product label of a person's name without qualification is a representation that the named person is the sole manufacturer of the product. That representation is false and misleading, and the drug product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the act, if the person is not the manufacturer of the product in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If the names of two or more persons appear on the label of a drug or drug product, the label may identify which of the persons is to be contacted for further information about the product.</P>
              <P>(4) If a trademark appears on the drug or drug product label or appears as a mark directly on the drug product (e.g., tablet or capsule), the label may identify the holder or licensee of the trademark. The label may also state whether the person identified holds the trademark or is licensee of the trademark.</P>
              <P>(5) If the distributor is named on the label, the name shall be qualified by one of the following phrases: “Manufactured for ______”, “Distributed by ______”, “Manufactured by ______ for ______”, “Manufactured for _____by _____”, “Distributor: ______”, “Marketed by ______”. The qualifying phrases may be abbreviated.</P>
              <P>(6) If the packer is identified on the label, the name shall be qualified by the phrase “Packed by ______” or “Packaged by ______”. The qualifying phrases may be abbreviated.</P>
              <P>(i) The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, State, and ZIP Code. For a foreign manufacturer, the statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, country, and any applicable mailing code. The street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP Code shall apply to consumer commodity labels developed or revised after July 1, 1969. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the ZIP Code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including the invoice).</P>
              <P>(j) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a drug or drug product at a place other than the person's principal place of business, the label may state the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such drug or drug product was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading.</P>
              <P>(k) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, do not apply to the labeling of drug components.</P>
              <P>(l) A drug product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the act if its labeling identifies a person as manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and that identification does not meet the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(m) This section does not apply to biological drug products that are subject to the requirements of section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 262.</P>

              <P>(a) Statements of all conditions, purposes, or uses for which such drug is intended, including conditions, purposes, or uses for which it is prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its oral, written, printed, or graphic advertising, and conditions, purposes, or uses for which the drug is commonly used; except that such statements shall not refer to conditions, uses, or purposes for which the drug can be safely used only under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law and for which it is advertised solely to such practitioner.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Drugs; statement of ingredients.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The ingredient information required by section 502(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shall appear together, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except the proprietary names of ingredients, which may be included with the listing of established names, and such statements that are specifically required for certain ingredients by the act or regulations in this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) The term <E T="03">ingredient</E> applies to any substance in the drug, whether added to the formulation as a single substance or in admixture with other substances.</P>
              <P>(c) The labeling of a drug may be misleading by reason (among other reasons) of:</P>
              <P>(1) The order in which the names of the ingredients present in the drug appear in the labeling, or the relative prominence otherwise given such names.</P>
              <P>(2) Failure to reveal the proportion of, or other fact with respect to, an ingredient present in such drug, when such proportion or other fact is material in the light of the representation that such ingredient is present in such drug.</P>
              <P>(3) The employment of a fanciful proprietary name for a drug or ingredient in such a manner as to imply that the drug or ingredient has some unique effectiveness or composition when, in fact, the drug or ingredient is a common substance, the limitations of which are readily recognized when the drug or ingredient is listed by its established name.</P>
              <P>(4) The featuring in the labeling of inert or inactive ingredients in a manner that creates an impression of value greater than their true functional role in the formulation.</P>
              <P>(5) Designation of a drug or ingredient by a proprietary name that, because of similarity in spelling or pronunciation, may be confused with the proprietary name or the established name of a different drug or ingredient.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) If the drug is in tablet or capsule form or other unit dosage form, any statement of the quantity of an ingredient contained therein shall express the quantity of such ingredient in each such unit. If the drug is not in unit dosage form, any statement of the quantity of an ingredient contained therein shall express the amount of such ingredient in a specified unit of <PRTPAGE P="13"/>weight or measure of the drug, or the percentage of such ingredient in such drug. Such statements shall be in terms that are informative to licensed practitioners, in the case of a prescription drug, and to the layman, in the case of a nonprescription drug.</P>

              <P>(2) A statement of the percentage of an ingredient in a drug shall, if the term <E T="03">percent</E> is used without qualification, mean percent weight-in-weight, if the ingredient and the drug are both solids, or if the ingredient is a liquid and the drug is a solid; percent weight in volume at 68 °F. (20 °C.), if the ingredient is a solid and the drug is a liquid; and percent volume in volume at 68 °F. (20 °C.), if both the ingredient and the drug are liquids, except that alcohol shall be stated in terms of percent volume of absolute alcohol at 60 °F. (15.56 °C.).</P>
              <P>(e) A derivative or preparation of a substance named in section 502(e) of the act is an article derived or prepared from such substance by any method, including actual or theoretical chemical action.</P>
              <P>(f) If an ingredient is a derivative or preparation of a substance specifically named in section 502(e) of the act and the established name of such ingredient does not indicate that it is a derivative or preparation of the parent substance named in section 502(e) of the act, the labeling shall, in conjunction with the listing of the established name of such ingredient, declare that such article is a derivative or preparation of such parent substance.</P>

              <P>(g)(1) If the label or labeling of a prescription drug bears a proprietary name or designation for the drug or any ingredient thereof, the established name, if such there be, corresponding to such proprietary name or designation shall accompany such proprietary name or designation each time it is featured on the label or in the labeling for the drug; but, except as provided in this subparagraph, the established name need not be used with the proprietary name or designation in the running text of the label or labeling. On any label or page of labeling in which the proprietary name or designation is not featured but is used in the running text, the established name shall be used at least once in the running text in association with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in such running text: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the proprietary name or designation is used in the running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name or designation in such running text. If any labeling includes a column with running text containing detailed information as to composition, prescribing, side effects, or contraindications and the proprietary name or designation is used in such column but is not featured above or below the column, the established name shall be used at least once in such column of running text in association with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in such column of running text: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the proprietary name or designation is used in such column of running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name or designation in such column of running text. Where the established name is required to accompany or to be used in association with the proprietary name or designation, the established name shall be placed in direct conjunction with the proprietary name or designation, and the relationship between the proprietary name or designation and the established name shall be made clear by use of a phrase such as “brand of” preceding the established name, by brackets surrounding the established name, or by other suitable means.</P>

              <P>(2) The established name shall be printed in letters that are at least half as large as the letters comprising the proprietary name or designation with which it is joined, and the established name shall have a prominence commensurate with the prominence with which such proprietary name or designation appears, taking into account all pertinent factors, including typography, layout, contrast, and other printing features.<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h)(1) In the case of a prescription drug containing two or more active ingredients, if the label bears a proprietary name or designation for such mixture and there is no established name corresponding to such proprietary name or designation, the quantitative ingredient information required on the label by section 502(e) of the act shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of the proprietary name or designation. The prominence of the quantitative ingredient information shall bear a reasonable relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name.</P>
              <P>(2) If the drug is packaged in a container too small to bear the quantitative ingredient information on the main display panel, the quantitative ingredient information required by section 502(e) of the act may appear elsewhere on the label, even though the proprietary name or designation appears on the main display panel of the label; but side- or back-panel placement shall in this case be so arranged and printed as to provide size and prominence of display reasonably related to the size and prominence of the front-panel display.</P>

              <P>(i) A drug packaged in a container too small or otherwise unable to accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear the information required for compliance with section 502(e)(1) (A)(ii) and (B) of the act shall be exempt from compliance with those clauses: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) The label bears:</P>
              <P>(i) The proprietary name of the drug;</P>
              <P>(ii) The established name, if such there be, of the drug;</P>

              <P>(a) Aspartame is the methylester of a dipeptide composed of two amino acids, phenylalanine and aspartic acid. When these two amino acids are so combined to form aspartame (1-methyl <E T="03">N</E>-L-α-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine), they produce an intensely sweet-tasting substance, approximately 180 times as sweet as sucrose. The Food and Drug Administration has determined that aspartame when used at a level no higher than reasonably required to perform its intended technical function is safe for use as an inactive ingredient in human drug products, provided persons with phenylketonuria, who must restrict carefully their phenylalanine intake, are alerted to the presence of phenylalanine in the drug product and the amount of the ingredient in each dosage unit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prescription drugs containing sulfites; required warning statements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Sulfites are chemical substances that are added to certain drug products to inhibit the oxidation of the active drug ingredient. Oxidation of the active drug ingredient may result in instability and a loss of potency of the drug product. Examples of specific sulfites used to inhibit this oxidation process include sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, potassium bisulfite, and potassium metabisulfite. Recent studies have demonstrated that sulfites may cause allergic-type reactions in certain susceptible persons, especially asthmatics. The labeling for any prescription drug product to which sulfites have been added as an inactive ingredient, regardless of the amount added, must bear the warning specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) The labeling required by §§ 201.57 and 201.100(d) for prescription drugs for human use containing a sulfite, except epinephrine for injection when intended for use in allergic or other emergency situations, shall bear the warning statement “Contains (<E T="03">insert the name of the sulfite, e.g., sodium metabisulfite</E>), a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.” This statement shall appear in the “Warnings” section of the labeling.</P>

              <P>(c) The labeling required by §§ 201.57 and 201.100(d) for sulfite-containing epinephrine for injection for use in allergic emergency situations shall bear the warning statement “Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or other emergency situations even though this product contains (<E T="03">insert the name of the sulfite, e.g., sodium metabisulfite</E>), a sulfite that may in other products cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms or life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible persons. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite(s) in this product should not deter administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations.” This statement shall appear in the “Warnings” section of the labeling.</P>

              <P>(a) A manufacturer of a marketed drug product, including a biological drug product, that is used in a substantial number of pediatric patients, or that provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients, as defined in §§ 314.55(c)(5) and 601.27(c)(5) of this chapter, but whose label does not provide adequate information to support its safe and effective use in pediatric populations for the approved indications may be required to submit an application containing data adequate to assess whether the drug product is safe and effective in pediatric populations. The application may be required to contain adequate evidence to support dosage and administration in some or all pediatric subpopulations, including neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, depending upon the known or appropriate use of the drug product in such subpopulations. The applicant may also be required to develop a pediatric formulation for a drug product that represents a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric populations for whom a pediatric formulation is necessary, unless the manufacturer demonstrates that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation have failed.</P>

              <P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may by order, in the form of a letter, after notifying the manufacturer of its intent to require an assessment of pediatric safety and effectiveness of a pediatric formulation, and after offering an opportunity for a written response and a meeting, which may include an advisory committee meeting, require a manufacturer to submit an application containing the information or request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in paragraph (a) of this section within a <PRTPAGE P="18"/>time specified in the order, if FDA finds that:</P>
              <P>(1) The drug product is used in a substantial number of pediatric patients for the labeled indications and the absence of adequate labeling could pose significant risks to pediatric patients; or</P>
              <P>(2) There is reason to believe that the drug product would represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients for one or more of the claimed indications, and the absence of adequate labeling could pose significant risks to pediatric patients.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) An applicant may request a full waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the applicant certifies that:</P>
              <P>(i) Necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical because, e.g., the number of such patients is so small or geographically dispersed, or</P>
              <P>(ii) There is evidence strongly suggesting that the product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups.</P>
              <P>(2) An applicant may request a partial waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a specified pediatric age group, if the applicant certifies that:</P>
              <P>(i) The product:</P>
              <P>(A) Does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age group, and</P>
              <P>(B) Is not likely to be used in a substantial number of patients in that age group, and</P>
              <P>(C) The absence of adequate labeling could not pose significant risks to pediatric patients; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical because, e.g., the number of patients in that age group is so small or geographically dispersed, or</P>
              <P>(iii) There is evidence strongly suggesting that the product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group, or</P>
              <P>(iv) The applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed.</P>
              <P>(3) FDA shall grant a full or partial waiver, as appropriate, if the agency finds that there is a reasonable basis on which to conclude that one or more of the grounds for waiver specified in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section have been met. If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver will cover only those pediatric age groups requiring that formulation. If a waiver is granted because there is evidence that the product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, this information will be included in the product's labeling.</P>
              <P>(d) If a manufacturer fails to submit a supplemental application containing the information or request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in paragraph (a) of this section within the time specified by FDA, the drug product may be considered misbranded or an unapproved new drug or unlicensed biologic.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Declaration of net quantity of contents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The label of a prescription or insulin-containing drug in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement of quantity of drugs in tablet, capsule, ampule, or other unit dosage form shall be expressed in terms of numerical count; the statement of quantity for drugs in other dosage forms shall be in terms of weight if the drug is solid, semi-solid, or viscous, or in terms of fluid measure if the drug is liquid. When the drug quantity statement is in terms of the numerical count of the drug units, it shall be augmented to give the weight or measure of the drug units or the quantity of each active ingredient in each drug unit or, when quantity does not accurately reflect drug potency, a statement of the drug potency.</P>
              <P>(b) Statements of weight of the contents shall in the case of prescription drugs be expressed in terms of avoirdupois pound, ounce, and grain or of kilogram, gram, and subdivisions thereof. A statement of liquid measure of the contents shall in the case of prescription drugs be expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, fluid-ounce, and fluid-dram subdivisions thereof, or of the liter and milliliter, or cubic centimeter, and shall express the volume at 68 °F. (20 °C.). A statement of the liquid measure of the contents in the case of insulin-containing drugs shall be expressed in terms of the liter and milliliter, or cubic centimeter, and shall express the volume at 68 °F. (20 °C.).</P>
              <P>(c) The declaration shall contain only such fractions as are generally used in expressing the quantity of the drug. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than three places, except in the case of a statement of the quantity of an active ingredient in a unit of a drug.</P>
              <P>(d) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the label and, in the case of large volume parenterals, may be embossed on the glass.</P>
              <P>(e) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of drug in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith.</P>

              <P>(f) A statement of the quantity of a prescription or insulin-containing drug in terms of weight or measure applicable to such drug, under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, shall <PRTPAGE P="22"/>express with prominence and conspicuousness the number of the largest whole unit, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, that are contained in the package. Any remainder shall be expressed in terms of common or decimal fractions of such unit or in terms of the next smaller whole unit and common or decimal fractions thereof.</P>
              <P>(g) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large. In the case of a liquid drug in ampules or vials, intended for injection, the declaration shall be considered to express the minimum quantity and the variation above the stated measure shall comply with the excess volume prescribed by the National Formulary or the U.S. Pharmacopeia for filling of ampules. In the case of a solid drug in ampules or vials, the declaration shall be considered to express the accurate net weight. Variations shall comply with the limitations provided in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary.</P>
              <P>(h) A drug shall be exempt from compliance with the net quantity declaration required by this section if it is an ointment labeled “sample”, “physician's sample”, or a substantially similar statement and the contents of the package do not exceed 8 grams.</P>

              <P>Section 201.100(b)(2) requires that labels for prescription drugs bear a statement of the recommended or usual dosage. Since the dosage for some prescription drugs varies within extremely wide limits, depending upon the conditions being treated, it may not be possible in all cases to present an informative or useful statement of the recommended or usual dosage in the space available on the label or carton of the package. It is the view of the Food and Drug Administration that when such a situation prevails, compliance with this requirement would be met by a statement such as “See package insert for dosage information”, where the detailed information is contained in such insert. However, if an informative, realistic, recommended or usual dosage can readily be set forth on the label, it should appear thereon.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">1 Indications and usage.</E> This section must state that the drug is indicated for the treatment, prevention, mitigation, cure, or diagnosis of a recognized disease or condition, or of a manifestation of a recognized disease or condition, or for the relief of symptoms associated with a recognized disease or condition.</P>
              <P>(i) This section must include the following information when the conditions listed are applicable:</P>
              <P>(A) If the drug is used for an indication only in conjunction with a primary mode of therapy (e.g., diet, surgery, behavior changes, or some other drug), a statement that the drug is indicated as an adjunct to that mode of therapy.</P>
              <P>(B) If evidence is available to support the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product only in selected subgroups of the larger population (e.g., patients with mild disease or patients in a special age group), or if the indication is approved based on a surrogate endpoint under § 314.510 or § 601.41 of this chapter, a succinct description of the limitations of usefulness of the drug and any uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits, with reference to the “Clinical Studies” section for a discussion of the available evidence.</P>
              <P>(C) If specific tests are necessary for selection or monitoring of the patients who need the drug (e.g., microbe susceptibility tests), the identity of such tests.</P>
              <P>(D) If information on limitations of use or uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits is relevant to the recommended intervals between doses, to the appropriate duration of treatment when such treatment should be limited, or to any modification of dosage, a concise description of the information with reference to the more detailed information in the “Dosage and Administration” section.</P>
              <P>(E) If safety considerations are such that the drug should be reserved for specific situations (e.g., cases refractory to other drugs), a statement of the information.</P>
              <P>(F) If there are specific conditions that should be met before the drug is used on a long term basis (e.g., demonstration of responsiveness to the drug in a short term trial in a given patient), a statement of the conditions; or, if the indications for long term use are different from those for short term use, a statement of the specific indications for each use.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there is a common belief that the drug may be effective for a certain use or if there is a common use of the drug for a condition, but the preponderance of evidence related to the use or condition shows that the drug is ineffective or that the therapeutic benefits of the product do not generally outweigh its risks, FDA may require that this section state that there is a lack of evidence that the drug is effective or safe for that use or condition.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any statements comparing the safety or effectiveness of the drug with other agents for the same indication must, except for biological products, be supported by substantial evidence derived from adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, such statements must be supported by substantial evidence.</P>
              <P>(iv) For drug products other than biological products, all indications listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter.

              <P>(v) For biological products, all indications listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">2 Dosage and administration.</E> (i) This section must state the recommended dose and, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(A) The dosage range,</P>

              <P>(B) An upper limit beyond which safety and effectiveness have not been established, or beyond which increasing the dose does not result in increasing effectiveness,<PRTPAGE P="28"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) Dosages for each indication and subpopulation,</P>
              <P>(D) The intervals recommended between doses,</P>
              <P>(E) The optimal method of titrating dosage,</P>
              <P>(F) The usual duration of treatment when treatment duration should be limited,</P>

              <P>(H) Modification of dosage needed because of drug interactions or in special patient populations (e.g., in children, in geriatric age groups, in groups defined by genetic characteristics, or in patients with renal or hepatic disease),</P>
              <P>(I) Important considerations concerning compliance with the dosage regimen,</P>
              <P>(J) Efficacious or toxic concentration ranges and therapeutic concentration windows of the drug or its metabolites, if established and clinically significant. Information on therapeutic drug concentration monitoring (TDM) must also be included in this section when TDM is necessary.</P>
              <P>(ii) Dosing regimens must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Radiation dosimetry information must be stated for both the patient receiving a radioactive drug and the person administering it.</P>
              <P>(iv) This section must also contain specific direction on dilution, preparation (including the strength of the final dosage solution, when prepared according to instructions, in terms of milligrams of active ingredient per milliliter of reconstituted solution, unless another measure of the strength is more appropriate), and administration of the dosage form, if needed (e.g., the rate of administration of parenteral drug in milligrams per minute; storage conditions for stability of the reconstituted drug, when important; essential information on drug incompatibilities if the drug is mixed in vitro with other drugs or diluents; and the following verbatim statement for parenterals: “Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.”)</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">3 Dosage forms and strengths.</E> This section must contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is responsible, including:</P>
              <P>(i) The strength or potency of the dosage form in metric system (e.g., 10 milligram tablets), and, if the apothecary system is used, a statement of the strength in parentheses after the metric designation; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the identifying characteristics of the dosage forms, including shape, color, coating, scoring, and imprinting, when applicable. The National Drug Code number(s) for the drug product must not be included in this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">4 Contraindications.</E> This section must describe any situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use (e.g., certain potentially fatal adverse reactions) clearly outweighs any possible therapeutic benefit. Those situations include use of the drug in patients who, because of their particular age, sex, concomitant therapy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by the drug and for whom no potential benefit makes the risk acceptable. Known hazards and not theoretical possibilities must be listed (e.g., if severe hypersensitivity to the drug has not been demonstrated, it should not be listed as a contraindication). If no contraindications are known, this section must state “None.”</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">5 Warnings and precautions.</E> (i) <E T="03">General.</E> This section must describe clinically significant adverse reactions (including any that are potentially fatal, are serious even if infrequent, or can be prevented or mitigated through appropriate use of the drug), other potential safety hazards (including those that are expected for the pharmacological class or those resulting from drug/drug interactions), limitations in use imposed by them (e.g., avoiding certain concomitant therapy), and steps that should be taken if they occur (e.g., dosage modification). The frequency of all clinically significant adverse reactions and the approximate <PRTPAGE P="29"/>mortality and morbidity rates for patients experiencing the reaction, if known and necessary for the safe and effective use of the drug, must be expressed as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. In accordance with §§ 314.70 and 601.12 of this chapter, the labeling must be revised to include a warning about a clinically significant hazard as soon as there is reasonable evidence of a causal association with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been definitely established. A specific warning relating to a use not provided for under the “Indications and Usage” section may be required by FDA in accordance with sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the act if the drug is commonly prescribed for a disease or condition and such usage is associated with a clinically significant risk or hazard.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other special care precautions.</E> This section must contain information regarding any special care to be exercised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug (e.g., precautions not required under any other specific section or subsection).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Monitoring: Laboratory tests.</E> This section must identify any laboratory tests helpful in following the patient's response or in identifying possible adverse reactions. If appropriate, information must be provided on such factors as the range of normal and abnormal values expected in the particular situation and the recommended frequency with which tests should be performed before, during, and after therapy.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Interference with laboratory tests.</E> This section must briefly note information on any known interference by the product with laboratory tests and reference the section where the detailed information is presented (e.g., “Drug Interactions” section).</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">6 Adverse reactions.</E> This section must describe the overall adverse reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety database. For purposes of prescription drug labeling, an adverse reaction is an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with use of a drug, that may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. This definition does not include all adverse events observed during use of a drug, only those adverse events for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Listing of adverse reactions.</E> This section must list the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable. The list or lists must be preceded by the information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions (e.g., for clinical trials, total number exposed, extent and nature of exposure).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Categorization of adverse reactions.</E> Within a listing, adverse reactions must be categorized by body system, by severity of the reaction, or in order of decreasing frequency, or by a combination of these, as appropriate. Within a category, adverse reactions must be listed in decreasing order of frequency. If frequency information cannot be reliably determined, adverse reactions must be listed in decreasing order of severity.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Clinical trials experience.</E> This section must list the adverse reactions identified in clinical trials that occurred at or above a specified rate appropriate to the safety database. The rate of occurrence of an adverse reaction for the drug and comparators (e.g., placebo) must be presented, unless such data cannot be determined or presentation of comparator rates would be misleading. If adverse reactions that occurred below the specified rate are included, they must be included in a separate listing. If comparative rates of occurrence cannot be reliably determined (e.g., adverse reactions were observed only in the uncontrolled trial portion of the overall safety database), adverse reactions must be grouped within specified frequency ranges as appropriate to the safety database for the drug (e.g., adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 1/100, adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 1/500) or descriptively identified, <PRTPAGE P="30"/>if frequency ranges cannot be determined. For adverse reactions with significant clinical implications, the listings must be supplemented with additional detail about the nature, frequency, and severity of the adverse reaction and the relationship of the adverse reaction to drug dose and demographic characteristics, if data are available and important.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Postmarketing experience.</E> This section of the labeling must list the adverse reactions, as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, that are identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Comparisons of adverse reactions between drugs.</E> For drug products other than biological products, any claim comparing the drug to which the labeling applies with other drugs in terms of frequency, severity, or character of adverse reactions must be based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, any such claim must be based on substantial evidence.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">7 Drug interactions.</E> (i) This section must contain a description of clinically significant interactions, either observed or predicted, with other prescription or over-the-counter drugs, classes of drugs, or foods (e.g., dietary supplements, grapefruit juice), and specific practical instructions for preventing or managing them. The mechanism(s) of the interaction, if known, must be briefly described. Interactions that are described in the “Contraindications” or “Warnings and Precautions” sections must be discussed in more detail under this section. Details of drug interaction pharmacokinetic studies that are included in the “Clinical Pharmacology” section that are pertinent to clinical use of the drug must not be repeated in this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) This section must also contain practical guidance on known interference of the drug with laboratory tests.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">8 Use in specific populations.</E> This section must contain the following subsections:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">8.1 Pregnancy.</E> This subsection of the labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the subheadings “Pregnancy Exposure Registry,” “Risk Summary,” “Clinical Considerations,” and “Data”:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Pregnancy exposure registry.</E> If there is a scientifically acceptable pregnancy exposure registry for the drug, contact information needed to enroll in the registry or to obtain information about the registry must be provided following the statement: “There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) during pregnancy.”</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Risk summary.</E> The Risk Summary must contain risk statement(s) based on data from all relevant sources (human, animal, and/or pharmacologic) that describe, for the drug, the risk of adverse developmental outcomes (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, functional impairment, alterations to growth). When multiple data sources are available, the statements must be presented in the following order: Human, animal, pharmacologic. The source(s) of the data must be stated. The labeling must state the percentage range of live births in the United States with a major birth defect and the percentage range of pregnancies in the United States that end in miscarriage, regardless of drug exposure. If such information is available for the population(s) for which the drug is labeled, it must also be included. When use of a drug is contraindicated during pregnancy, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary. When applicable, risk statements as described in paragraphs (c)(9)(i)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section must include a cross-reference to additional details in the relevant portion of the “Data” subheading in the “Pregnancy” subsection of the labeling. If data demonstrate that a drug is not systemically absorbed following a particular route of administration, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: “(<E T="03">Name of drug</E>) is not absorbed systemically following (route of administration), and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug.”<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Risk statement based on human data.</E> When human data are available that establish the presence or absence of any adverse developmental outcome(s) associated with maternal use of the drug, the Risk Summary must summarize the specific developmental outcome(s); their incidence; and the effects of dose, duration of exposure, and gestational timing of exposure. If human data indicate that there is an increased risk for a specific adverse developmental outcome in infants born to women exposed to the drug during pregnancy, this risk must be quantitatively compared to the risk for the same outcome in infants born to women who were not exposed to the drug but who have the disease or condition for which the drug is indicated to be used. When risk information is not available for women with the disease or condition for which the drug is indicated, the risk for the specific outcome must be compared to the rate at which the outcome occurs in the general population. The Risk Summary must state when there are no human data or when available human data do not establish the presence or absence of drug-associated risk.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Risk statement based on animal data.</E> When animal data are available, the Risk Summary must summarize the findings in animals and based on these findings, describe, for the drug, the potential risk of any adverse developmental outcome(s) in humans. This statement must include: The number and type(s) of species affected, timing of exposure, animal doses expressed in terms of human dose or exposure equivalents, and outcomes for pregnant animals and offspring. When animal studies do not meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies, the Risk Summary must so state. When there are no animal data, the Risk Summary must so state.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Risk statement based on pharmacology.</E> When the drug has a well-understood mechanism of action that may result in adverse developmental outcome(s), the Risk Summary must explain the mechanism of action and the potential associated risks.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Clinical considerations.</E> Under the subheading “Clinical Considerations,” the labeling must provide relevant information, to the extent it is available, under the headings “Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk,” “Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period,” “Maternal adverse reactions,” “Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions,” and “Labor or delivery”:</P>

              <P>(B) Specific statements on geriatric use of the drug for an indication approved for adults generally, as distinguished from a specific geriatric indication, must be contained in the “Geriatric use” subsection and must reflect all information available to the sponsor that is relevant to the appropriate use of the drug in elderly patients. This information includes detailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-documented studies obtained from a literature search. Controlled studies include those that are part of the marketing application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug application, new drug application, biologics license application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applications (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The “Geriatric use” subsection must contain the following statement(s) or reasonable alternative, as applicable, taking into account available information:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the “Geriatric use” subsection must include the following statement:</P>

The “Clinical Pharmacology” and “Drug Interactions” sections ordinarily contain information on drug/disease and drug/drug interactions that is particularly relevant to the elderly, who are more likely to have concomitant illness and to use concomitant drugs.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If a drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the “Geriatric use” subsection must include the statement:</P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              <P>(D) If use of the drug in the elderly appears to cause a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in the “Geriatric use” subsection, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the “Contraindications” or “Warnings and Precautions” section, and the “Geriatric use” subsection must refer to those sections.</P>
              <P>(E) Labeling under paragraphs (c)(9)(v)(A) through (c)(9)(v)(C) of this section may include statements, if they are necessary for safe and effective use of the drug, and reflect good clinical practice or past experience in a particular situation, e.g., for a sedating drug, it could be stated that:</P>

              <P>(B) For other classes of drugs, in vitro and animal data that have not been shown by adequate and well-controlled studies, as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter, to be necessary for the safe and effective use may be included in this section only if a waiver is granted under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(14) <E T="03">13 Nonclinical toxicology.</E> This section must contain the following subsections as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">13.1 Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility.</E> This subsection must state whether long term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential and, if so, the species and results. If results from reproduction studies or other data in animals raise concern about mutagenesis or impairment of fertility in either males or females, this must be described. Any precautionary statement on these topics must include practical, relevant advice to the prescriber on the significance of these animal findings. Human data suggesting that the drug may be carcinogenic or mutagenic, or suggesting that it impairs fertility, as described in the “Warnings and Precautions” section, must not be included in this subsection of the labeling.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">13.2 Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology.</E> Significant animal data necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans that is not incorporated in other sections of labeling must be included in this section (e.g., specifics about studies used to support approval under § 314.600 or § 601.90 of this chapter, the absence of chronic animal toxicity data for a drug that is administered over prolonged periods or is implanted in the body).</P>
              <P>(15) <E T="03">14 Clinical studies.</E> This section must discuss those clinical studies that facilitate an understanding of how to use the drug safely and effectively. Ordinarily, this section will describe the studies that support effectiveness for the labeled indication(s), including discussion of study design, population, endpoints, and results, but must not include an encyclopedic listing of all, or even most, studies performed as part of the product's clinical development program. If a specific important clinical study is mentioned in any section of the labeling required under §§ 201.56 and 201.57 because the study is essential to an understandable presentation of the <PRTPAGE P="39"/>information in that section of the labeling, any detailed discussion of the study must appear in this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For drug products other than biological products, any clinical study that is discussed in prescription drug labeling that relates to an indication for or use of the drug must be adequate and well-controlled as described in § 314.126(b) of this chapter and must not imply or suggest indications or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the “Indications and Usage” or “Dosage and Administration” section. For biological products, any clinical study that is discussed that relates to an indication for or use of the biological product must constitute or contribute to substantial evidence and must not imply or suggest indications or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the “Indications and Usage” or “Dosage and Administration” section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any discussion of a clinical study that relates to a risk from the use of the drug must also refer to the other sections of the labeling where the risk is identified or discussed.</P>
              <P>(16) <E T="03">15 References.</E> When prescription drug labeling must summarize or otherwise rely on a recommendation by an authoritative scientific body, or on a standardized methodology, scale, or technique, because the information is important to prescribing decisions, the labeling may include a reference to the source of the information.</P>
              <P>(17) <E T="03">16 How supplied/storage and handling.</E> This section must contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is responsible. The information must include, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) The strength or potency of the dosage form in metric system (e.g., 10 milligram tablets) and, if the apothecary system is used, a statement of the strength in parentheses after the metric designation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The units in which the dosage form is ordinarily available for prescribing by practitioners (e.g., bottles of 100);</P>
              <P>(iii) Appropriate information to facilitate identification of the dosage forms, such as shape, color, coating, scoring, imprinting, and National Drug Code number; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Special handling and storage conditions.</P>
              <P>(18) <E T="03">17 Patient counseling information.</E> This section must contain information necessary for patients to use the drug safely and effectively (e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects). Any FDA-approved patient labeling must be referenced in this section and the full text of such patient labeling must be reprinted immediately following this section or, alternatively, accompany the prescription drug labeling. Any FDA-approved patient labeling printed immediately following this section or accompanying the labeling is subject to the type size requirements in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, except for a Medication Guide to be detached and distributed to patients in compliance with § 208.24 of this chapter. Medication Guides for distribution to patients are subject to the type size requirements set forth in § 208.20 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Format requirements.</E> All labeling information required under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must be printed in accordance with the following specifications:</P>
              <P>(1) All headings and subheadings required by paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section must be highlighted by bold type that prominently distinguishes the headings and subheadings from other labeling information. Reverse type is not permitted as a form of highlighting.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Principal display panel.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The term <E T="03">principal display panel,</E> as it applies to over-the-counter drugs in package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring designs, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term <E T="03">area of the principal display panel</E> means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal display panel, which area shall be:</P>
              <P>(a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side;</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference; and</P>

              <P>(c) In the case of any other shape of container, 40 percent of the total surface of the container: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That where such container presents an obvious “principal display panel” such as the top of a triangular or circular package, the area shall consist of the entire top surface.<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
              </P>
              <FP>In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at the tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale.</FP>

              <P>(a) The principal display panel of an over-the-counter drug in package form shall bear as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the commodity.</P>
              <P>(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of the established name of the drug, if any there be, followed by an accurate statement of the general pharmacological category(ies) of the drug or the principal intended action(s) of the drug. In the case of an over-the-counter drug that is a mixture and that has no established name, this requirement shall be deemed to be satisfied by a prominent and conspicuous statement of the general pharmacological action(s) of the mixture or of its principal intended action(s) in terms that are meaningful to the layman. Such statements shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of the proprietary name or designation and shall employ terms descriptive of general pharmacological category(ies) or principal intended action(s); for example, “antacid,” “analgesic,” “decongestant,” “antihistaminic,” etc. The indications for use shall be included in the directions for use of the drug, as required by section 502(f)(1) of the act and by the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) The statement of identity shall be presented in bold face type on the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Declaration of net quantity of contents.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The label of an over-the-counter drug in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination or numerical count and weight, measure, or size. The statement of quantity of drugs in tablet, capsule, ampule, or other unit form and the quantity of devices shall be expressed in terms of numerical count; the statement of quantity for drugs in other dosage forms shall be in terms of weight if the drug is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or in terms of fluid measure if the drug is liquid. The drug quantity statement shall be augmented when necessary to give accurate information as to the strength of such drug in the package; for example, to differentiate between several strengths of the same drug “100 tablets, 5 grains each” or “100 capsules, 125 milligrams each” or “100 capsules, 250 milligrams each”: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a firmly established, general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the quantity of a drug in terms of linear measure or measure of area, such respective term may be used. Such term shall be augmented when necessary for accuracy of information by a statement of the weight, measure, or size of the individual units or of the entire drug; for example, the net quantity of adhesive tape in package form shall be expressed in terms of linear measure augmented by a statement of its width.</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever the Commissioner determines for a specific packaged drug that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of these does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers, he shall by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such article.</P>

              <P>(b) Statements of weight of the contents shall be expressed in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce. A statement of liquid measure of the contents shall be expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid-ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall express the volume <PRTPAGE P="42"/>at 68 °F (20 °C). See also paragraph (p) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eights, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established, general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions.</P>
              <P>(d) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel.</P>

              <P>(e) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated, by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration, from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and, by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement, from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count, such as “giant pint” and “full quart”, that tends to exaggerate the amount of the drug in the container. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) On packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part; and</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a drug that is marketed with both outer and inner retail containers bearing the mandatory label information required by this part and the inner container is not intended to be sold separately, the net quantity of contents placement requirement of this section applicable to such inner container is waived.</P>
              <P>(3) The principal display panel of a drug marketed on a display card to which the immediate container is affixed may be considered to be the display panel of the card, and the type size of the net quantity of contents statement is governed by the dimensions of the display card.</P>

              <P>(f) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of drug or device in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in the case of drugs packed in containers designed to deliver the drug under pressure, the declaration shall state the net quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included in the net quantity declaration.</P>
              <P>(g) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that:</P>
              <P>(1) The ratio of height to width of the letter shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit, i.e., no more than 3 times as high as it is wide.</P>
              <P>(2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards.</P>
              <P>(3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the minimum height standards.</P>

              <P>(h) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and <PRTPAGE P="43"/>shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:</P>
              <P>(1) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.</P>
              <P>(2) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than five but not more than 25 square inches.</P>
              <P>(3) Not less than three-sixteenths inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches.</P>

              <P>(4) Not less than one-fourth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, except not less than one-half inch in height if the area is more than 400 square inches.
              </P>
              <FP>Where the declaration is blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface rather than by printing, typing, or coloring, the lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (h) (1) through (4) of this section shall be increased by one-sixteenth of an inch.</FP>
              <P>(i) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:</P>
              <P>(1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs (k) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples set forth in paragraphs (k) (3) and (4) of this section). If the net weight of the package is less than 1 ounce avoirdupois or the net fluid measure is less than 1 fluid ounce, the declaration shall be in terms of common or decimal fractions of the respective ounce and not in terms of drams.</P>

              <P>(2) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term <E T="03">net weight</E> shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. Use of the terms <E T="03">net</E> or <E T="03">net contents</E> in terms of fluid measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for example, “Net wt. 6 oz” or “6 oz net wt.,” and “6 fl oz” or “net contents 6 fl oz”.</P>
              <P>(j) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound; in the case of fluid measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons, followed by common or decimal fractions of a gallon or by the next smaller whole unit or units (quarts or quarts and pints)) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart; see paragraph (k)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(k) Examples:</P>
              <P>(1) A declaration of 1<FR>1/2</FR> pounds weight shall be expressed as “Net wt. 24 oz (1 lb 8 oz),” or “Net wt. 24 oz (1<FR>1/2</FR> lb)” or “Net wt. 24 oz (1.5 lb)”.</P>
              <P>(2) A declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net wt. 12 oz”.</P>
              <P>(3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 32 fl oz (1 qt)” or “32 fl oz (1 qt)”.</P>
              <P>(4) A declaration of 1<FR>3/4</FR> quarts liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 56 fl oz (1 qt 1 pt 8 oz)” or “Net contents 56 fl oz (1 qt 1.5 pt),” but not in terms of quart and ounce such as “Net 56 fl oz (1 qt 24 oz).”</P>
              <P>(5) A declaration of 2<FR>1/2</FR> gallons liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 2 gal 2 qt,” “Net contents 2.5 gallons,” or “Net contents 2<FR>1/2</FR> gal” but not as “2 gal 4 pt”.</P>

              <P>(l) For quantities, the following abbreviations and none other may be employed. Periods and plural forms are optional:

The type shall be all black or one color printed on a white or other contrasting background, except that the <PRTPAGE P="50"/>title and the headings may be presented in a single, alternative, contrasting color unless otherwise provided in an approved drug application, OTC drug monograph (e.g., current requirements for bold print in §§ 341.76 and 341.80 of this chapter), or other OTC drug regulation (e.g., the requirement for a box and red letters in § 201.308(c)(1)).</P>
              <P>(4) When there is more than one statement, each individual statement listed under the headings and subheadings in paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(7) of this section shall be preceded by a solid square or solid circle bullet of 5-point type size. Bullets shall be presented in the same shape and color throughout the labeling. The first bulleted statement on each horizontal line of text shall be either left justified or separated from an appropriate heading or subheading by at least two square “ems” (i.e., two squares of the size of the letter “M”). If more than one bulleted statement is placed on the same horizontal line, the end of one bulleted statement shall be separated from the beginning of the next bulleted statement by at least two square “ems” and the complete additional bulleted statement(s) shall not continue to the next line of text. Additional bulleted statements appearing on each subsequent horizontal line of text under a heading or subheading shall be vertically aligned with the bulleted statements appearing on the previous line.</P>
              <P>(5) The title, headings, subheadings, and information set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section may appear on more than one panel on the outside container of the retail package, or the immediate container label if there is no outside container or wrapper. The continuation of the required content and format onto multiple panels must retain the required order and flow of headings, subheadings, and information. A visual graphic (e.g., an arrow) shall be used to signal the continuation of the Drug Facts labeling to the next adjacent panel.</P>
              <P>(6) The heading and information required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall appear immediately adjacent and to the left of the heading and information required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The active ingredients and purposes shall be aligned under the appropriate headings such that the heading and information required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be left justified and the heading and information required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be right justified. If the OTC drug product contains more than one active ingredient, the active ingredients shall be listed in alphabetical order. If more than one active ingredient has the same purpose, the purpose need not be repeated for each active ingredient, provided the information is presented in a manner that readily associates each active ingredient with its purpose (i.e., through the use of brackets, dot leaders, or other graphical features). The information described in paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(6) through (c)(9) of this section may start on the same line as the required headings. None of the information described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section shall appear on the same line as the “Warning” or “Warnings” heading.</P>
              <P>(7) Graphical images (e.g., the UPC symbol) and information not described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section shall not appear in or in any way interrupt the required title, headings, subheadings, and information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section. Hyphens shall not be used except to punctuate compound words.</P>

              <P>(8) The information described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section shall be set off in a box or similar enclosure by the use of a barline. A distinctive horizontal barline extending to each end of the “Drug Facts” box or similar enclosure shall provide separation between each of the headings listed in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section. When a heading listed in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section appears on a subsequent panel immediately after the “Drug Facts (continued)” title, a horizontal hairline shall follow the title and immediately precede the heading. A horizontal hairline extending within two spaces on either side of the “Drug Facts” box or similar enclosure shall immediately follow the title and shall <PRTPAGE P="51"/>immediately precede each of the subheadings set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, except the subheadings in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A) through (c)(5)(ii)(G) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) The information set forth in paragraph (c)(6) of this section under the heading “Directions” shall appear in a table format when dosage directions are provided for three or more age groups or populations. The last line of the table may be the horizontal barline immediately preceding the heading of the next section of the labeling.</P>
              <P>(10) If the title, headings, subheadings, and information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section, printed in accordance with the specifications in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(9) of this section, and any other FDA required information for drug products, and, as appropriate, cosmetic products, other than information required to appear on a principle display panel, requires more than 60 percent of the total surface area available to bear labeling, then the Drug Facts labeling shall be printed in accordance with the specifications set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(i) through (d)(10)(v) of this section. In determining whether more than 60 percent of the total surface area available to bear labeling is required, the indications for use listed under the “Use(s)” heading, as set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, shall be limited to the minimum required uses reflected in the applicable monograph, as provided in § 330.1(c)(2) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(i) Paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(5), (d)(6), and (d)(7) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(ii) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall apply except that the letter height or type size for the title “Drug Facts (continued)” shall be no smaller than 7-point type and the headings in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section shall be the larger of either 7-point or greater type, or 1-point size greater than the point size of the text.</P>
              <P>(iii) Paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply except that less than 0.5-point leading may be used, provided the ascenders and descenders do not touch.</P>
              <P>(iv) Paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall apply except that if more than one bulleted statement is placed on the same horizontal line, the additional bulleted statements may continue to the next line of text, and except that the bullets under each heading or subheading need not be vertically aligned.</P>
              <P>(v) Paragraph (d)(8) of this section shall apply except that the box or similar enclosure required in paragraph (d)(8) of this section may be omitted if the Drug Facts labeling is set off from the rest of the labeling by use of color contrast.</P>

The summary may include information based on in vitro and/or animal data if the information is essential to a description of the biochemical and/or physiological mode of action of the drug or is otherwise pertinent to human therapeutics. Pharmacokinetic information that is important to safe and effective use of the drug is required, if known, e.g., degree and rate of absorption, pathways of biotransformation, percentage of dose as unchanged drug and metabolites, rate or half-time of elimination, concentration in body fluids associated with therapeutic and/or toxic effects, degree of binding to plasma proteins, degree of uptake by a particular organ or in the fetus, and passage across the blood brain barrier. Inclusion of pharmacokinetic information is restricted to that which relates to clinical use of the drug. If the pharmacological mode of action of the drug is unknown or if important metabolic or pharmacokinetic data in humans are unavailable, the labeling shall contain a statement about the lack of information.</P>
              <P>(2) Data that demonstrate activity or effectiveness in in vitro or animal tests and that have not been shown by adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to be pertinent to clinical use may be included under this section of the labeling only under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) In vitro data for anti-infective drugs may be included if the data are immediately preceded by the statement “The following in vitro data are available but their clinical significance is unknown.”</P>
              <P>(ii) For other classes of drugs, in vitro and animal data that have not been shown by adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter, to be pertinent to clinical use may be used only if a waiver is granted under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Indications and Usage.</E> (1) Under this section heading, the labeling shall state that:</P>
              <P>(i) The drug is indicated in the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a recognized disease or condition, e.g., penicillin is indicated for the treatment of pneumonia due to susceptible pneumococci; and/or</P>
              <P>(ii) The drug is indicated for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of an important manifestation of a disease or condition, e.g., chlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of edema in patients with congestive heart failure; and/or</P>

              <P>(iii) The drug is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with a disease or syndrome, e.g., chlorpheniramine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion <PRTPAGE P="59"/>in patients with vasomotor rhinitis; and/or</P>
              <P>(iv) The drug, if used for a particular indication only in conjuction with a primary mode of therapy, e.g., diet, surgery, or some other drug, is an adjunct to the mode of therapy.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For drug products other than biological products, all indications listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not included in this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For biological products, all indications listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not included in this section.</P>
              <P>(3) This section of the labeling shall also contain the following additional information:</P>
              <P>(i) If evidence is available to support the safety and effectiveness of the drug only in selected subgroups of the larger population with a disease, syndrome, or symptom under consideration, e.g., patients with mild disease or patients in a special age group, the labeling shall describe the available evidence and state the limitations of usefulness of the drug. The labeling shall also identify specific tests needed for selection or monitoring of the patients who need the drug, e.g., microbe susceptibility tests. Information on the approximate kind, degree, and duration of improvement to be anticipated shall be stated if available and shall be based on substantial evidence derived from adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter. If the information is relevant to the recommended intervals between doses, the usual duration of treatment, or any modification of dosage, it shall be stated in the “Dosage and Administration” section of the labeling and referenced in this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If safety considerations are such that the drug should be reserved for certain situations, e.g., cases refractory to other drugs, this information shall be stated in this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If there are specific conditions that should be met before the drug is used on a long-term basis, e.g., demonstration of responsiveness to the drug in a short-term trial, the labeling shall identify the conditions; or, if the indications for long-term use are different from those for short-term use, the labeling shall identify the specific indications for each use.</P>
              <P>(iv) If there is a common belief that the drug may be effective for a certain use or if there is a common use of the drug for a condition, but the preponderance of evidence related to the use or condition shows that the drug is ineffective, the Food and Drug Administration may require that the labeling state that there is a lack of evidence that the drug is effective for that use or condition.</P>
              <P>(v) Any statements comparing the safety or effectiveness, either greater or less, of the drug with other agents for the same indication shall be supported by adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Contraindications.</E> Under this section heading, the labeling shall describe those situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use clearly outweighs any possible benefit. These situations include administration of the drug to patients known to have a hypersensitivity to it; use of the drug in patients who, because of their particular age, sex, concomitant therapy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by it; or continued use of the drug in the face of an unacceptably hazardous adverse reaction. Known hazards and not theoretical possibilities shall be listed, e.g., if hypersensitivity to the drug has not been demonstrated, it should not be listed as a contraindication. If no contraindications are known, this section of the labeling shall state “None known.”</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Warnings.</E> Under this section heading, the labeling shall describe serious <PRTPAGE P="60"/>adverse reactions and potential safety hazards, limitations in use imposed by them, and steps that should be taken if they occur. The labeling shall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been proved. A specific warning relating to a use not provided for under the “Indications and Usage” section of the labeling may be required by the Food and Drug Administration if the drug is commonly prescribed for a disease or condition, and there is lack of substantial evidence of effectivenes for that disease or condition, and such usage is associated with serious risk or hazard. Special problems, particularly those that may lead to death or serious injury, may be required by the Food and Drug Administration to be placed in a prominently displayed box. The boxed warning ordinarily shall be based on clinical data, but serious animal toxicity may also be the basis of a boxed warning in the absence of clinical data. If a boxed warning is required, its location will be specified by the Food and Drug Administration. The frequency of these serious adverse reactions and, if known, the approximate mortality and morbidity rates for patients sustaining the reaction, which are important to safe and effective use of the drug, shall be expressed as provided under the “Adverse Reactions” section of the labeling.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Precautions.</E> Under this section heading, the labeling shall contain the following subsections as appropriate for the drug:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> This subsection of the labeling shall contain information regarding any special care to be exercised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug, e.g., precautions not required under any other specific section or subsection of the labeling.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Information for patients.</E> This subsection must contain information necessary for patients to use the drug safely and effectively (e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects). Any FDA-approved patient labeling must be referenced in this section and the full text of such patient labeling must be reprinted immediately following the last section of labeling or, alternatively, accompany the prescription drug labeling. The type size requirement for the Medication Guide set forth in § 208.20 of this chapter does not apply to the Medication Guide that is reprinted in or accompanying the prescription drug labeling unless such Medication Guide is to be detached and distributed to patients in compliance with § 208.24 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Laboratory tests.</E> This subsection of the labeling shall identify any laboratory tests that may be helpful in following the patient's response or in identifying possible adverse reactions. If appropriate, information shall be provided on such factors as the range of normal and abnormal values expected in the particular situation and the recommended frequency with which tests should be done before, during, and after therapy.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) <E T="03">Drug interactions.</E> This subsection of the labeling shall contain specific practical guidance for the physician on preventing clinically significant drug/drug and drug/food interactions that may occur in vivo in patients taking the drug. Specific drugs or classes of drugs with which the drug to which the labeling applies may interact in vivo shall be identified, and the mechanism(s) of the interaction shall be briefly described. Information in this subsection of the labeling shall be limited to that pertaining to clinical use of the drug in patients. Drug interactions supported only by animal or in vitro experiments may not ordinarily be included, but animal or in vitro data may be used if shown to be clinically relevant. Drug incompatibilities, i.e., drug interactions that may occur when drugs are mixed in vitro, as in a solution for intravenous administration, shall be discussed under the “Dosage and Administration” section of the labeling rather than under this subsection of the labeling.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Drug/laboratory test interactions.</E> This subsection of the labeling shall contain practical guidance on known interference of the drug with laboratory tests.<PRTPAGE P="61"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility.</E> This subsection of the labeling shall state whether long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential and, if so, the species and results. If reproduction studies or other data in animals reveal a problem or potential problem concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility in either males or females, the information shall be described. Any precautionary statement on these topics shall include practical, relevant advice to the physician on the significance of these animal findings. If there is evidence from human data that the drug may be carcinogenic or mutagenic or that it impairs fertility, this information shall be included under the “Warnings” section of the labeling. Also, under “Precautions,” the labeling shall state: “See ‘Warnings’ section for information on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.”</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Pregnancy.</E> This subsection of the labeling may be omitted only if the drug is not absorbed systemically and the drug is not known to have a potential for indirect harm to the fetus. For all other drugs, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Teratogenic effects.</E> Under this heading the labeling shall identify one of the following categories that applies to the drug, and the labeling shall bear the statement required under the category:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>)  If adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: “Studies in pregnant women have not shown that (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during the first (<E T="03">second, third, or all</E>) trimester(<E T="03">s</E>) of pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the possibility of fetal harm appears remote. Because studies cannot rule out the possibility of harm, however, (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.” The labeling shall also contain a description of the human studies. If animal reproduction studies are available and they fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, the labeling shall also state: “Reproduction studies have been performed in (<E T="03">kinds of animal</E>(<E T="03">s</E>)) at doses up to (<E T="03">x</E>) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to (<E T="03">name of drug</E>).” The labeling shall also contain a description of available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>)  If animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the labeling shall state: “ Reproduction studies have been performed in (<E T="03">kind</E>(<E T="03">s</E>) <E T="03">of animal</E>(<E T="03">s</E>)) at doses up to (<E T="03">x</E>) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to (<E T="03">name of drug</E>). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.” If animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than decrease in fertility), but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: “Reproduction studies in (<E T="03">kind</E>(<E T="03">s</E>) <E T="03">of animal</E>(<E T="03">s</E>)) have shown (<E T="03">describe findings</E>) at (<E T="03">x</E>) times the human dose. Studies in pregnant women, however, have not shown that (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during the first (<E T="03">second, third, or all</E>) trimester(<E T="03">s</E>) of pregnancy. Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote, if the drug is used during pregnancy. Nevertheless, because the studies in humans cannot rule out the possibility of harm, (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.” The labeling shall also contain a description of the human studies and a description of available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child.<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>)  If animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, if there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and if the benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks, the labeling shall state: “ (<E T="03">Name of drug</E>) has been shown to be teratogenic (or to have an embryocidal effect or other adverse effect) in (<E T="03">name</E>(<E T="03">s</E>) <E T="03">of species</E>) when given in doses (<E T="03">x</E>) times the human dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. (<E T="03">Name of drug</E>) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.” The labeling shall contain a description of the animal studies. If there are no animal reproduction studies and no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, the labeling shall state: “Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with (<E T="03">name of drug</E>). It is also not known whether (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. (<E T="03">Name of drug</E>) should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.” The labeling shall contain a description of any available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">d</E>)  If there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but the potential benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks (for example, if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective), the labeling shall state: “ See ‘Warnings’ section.” Under the “Warnings” section, the labeling states: “(<E T="03">Name of drug</E>) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. (<E T="03">Describe the human data and any pertinent animal data.</E>) If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.”</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">e</E>)  If studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or if there is positive evidence of fetal risk based on adverse reaction reports from investigational or marketing experience, or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in a pregnant woman clearly outweighs any possible benefit (for example, safer drugs or other forms of therapy are available), the labeling shall state: “ See ‘Contraindications’ section.” Under “Contraindications,” the labeling shall state: <E T="03">“(Name of drug)</E> may (<E T="03">can</E>) cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. (<E T="03">Describe the human data and any pertinant animal data.</E>) (<E T="03">Name of drug</E>) is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.”</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Nonteratogenic effects.</E> Under this heading the labeling shall contain other information on the drug's effects on reproduction and the drug's use during pregnancy that is not required specifically by one of the pregnancy categories, if the information is relevant to the safe and effective use of the drug. Information required under this heading shall include nonteratogenic effects in the fetus or newborn infant (for example, withdrawal symptoms or hypoglycemia) that may occur because of a pregnant woman's chronic use of the drug for a preexisting condition or disease.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Labor and delivery.</E> If the drug has a recognized use during labor or delivery (vaginal or abdominal delivery), whether or not the use is stated in the indications section of the labeling, this subsection of the labeling shall describe the available information about the effect of the drug on the mother and the fetus, on the duration of labor or delivery, on the possibility that forceps delivery or other intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary, and the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child. If any information required under this subsection is unknown, this subsection of the labeling shall state that the information is unknown.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Nursing mothers.</E> (i) If a drug is absorbed systemically, this subsection of <PRTPAGE P="63"/>the labeling shall contain, if known, information about excretion of the drug in human milk and effects on the nursing infant. Pertinent adverse effects observed in animal offspring shall be described.</P>

              <P>(ii) If a drug is absorbed systemically and is known to be excreted in human milk, this subsection of the labeling shall contain one of the following statements, as appropriate. If the drug is associated with serious adverse reactions or if the drug has a known tumorigenic potential, the labeling shall state: “Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) (or, “Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) in (<E T="03">animal or human</E>) studies), a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.” If the drug is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential, the labeling shall state: “Caution should be exercised when (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) is administered to a nursing woman.”</P>

              <P>(iii) If a drug is absorbed systemically and information on excretion in human milk is unknown, this subsection of the labeling shall contain one of the following statements, as appropriate. If the drug is associated with serious adverse reactions or has a known tumorigenic potential, the labeling shall state: “It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) (or, “Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) in (<E T="03">animal or human</E>) studies), a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.” If the drug is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential, the labeling shall state: “It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) is administered to a nursing woman.”</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Pediatric use.</E> (i) Pediatric population(s)/pediatric patient(s): For the purposes of paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(viii) of this section, the terms <E T="03">pediatric population(s)</E> and <E T="03">pediatric patient(s)</E> are defined as the pediatric age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there is a specific pediatric indication (i.e., an indication different from those approved for adults) that is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, it shall be described under the “Indications and Usage” section of the labeling, and appropriate pediatric dosage information shall be given under the “Dosage and Administration” section of the labeling. The “Pediatric use” subsection shall cite any limitations on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this subsection of the labeling should be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the “Clinical Pharmacology” or “Clinical Studies” section. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in the “Contraindications,” “Warnings,” and elsewhere in the “Precautions” sections.</P>

              <P>(iii) If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indication also approved for adults that are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they shall be summarized in the “Pediatric use” subsection of the labeling and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the “Clinical Pharmacology” and “Clinical Studies” sections. Appropriate pediatric dosage shall be given under the “Dosage and Administration” section of the labeling. The “Pediatric use” subsection of the labeling shall also cite any limitations on the pediatric use statement, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug <PRTPAGE P="64"/>in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in the “Contraindications,” “Warnings,” and elsewhere in the “Precautions” sections.</P>

              <P>(iv) FDA may approve a drug for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, with other information supporting pediatric use. In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the disease and the effects of the drug, both beneficial and adverse, are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The additional information supporting pediatric use must ordinarily include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of appropriate dosage. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in the pediatric population, data from other studies supporting the safety or effectiveness of the drug in pediatric patients, pertinent premarketing or postmarketing studies or experience, may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and effectively in pediatric patients. When a drug is approved for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with other information supporting pediatric use, the “Pediatric use” subsection of the labeling shall contain either the following statement, or a reasonable alternative: “The safety and effectiveness of (<E T="03">drug name</E>) have been established in the age groups _ to _ (note any limitations, e.g., no data for pediatric patients under 2, or only applicable to certain indications approved in adults). Use of (<E T="03">drug name</E>) in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of (<E T="03">drug name</E>) in adults with additional data (insert wording that accurately describes the data submitted to support a finding of substantial evidence of effectiveness in the pediatric population).” Data summarized in the preceding prescribed statement in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the “Clinical Pharmacology” or the “Clinical Studies” section. For example, pediatric pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies and dose-response information should be described in the “Clinical Pharmacology” section. Pediatric dosing instructions shall be included in the “Dosage and Administration” section of the labeling. Any differences between pediatric and adult responses, need for specific monitoring, dosing adjustments, and any other information related to safe and effective use of the drug in pediatric patients shall be cited briefly in the “Pediatric use” subsection and, as appropriate, in the “Contraindications,” “Warnings,” “Precautions,” and “Dosage and Administration” sections.</P>
              <P>(v) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for a particular pediatric population, the “Pediatric use” subsection of the labeling shall contain an appropriate statement such as “Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of (_) have not been established.” If use of the drug in this pediatric population is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in this subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the “Contraindications” or “Warnings” section of the labeling and this subsection shall refer to it.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for any pediatric population, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following statement: “Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.” If use of the drug in premature or neonatal infants, or other pediatric subgroups, is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in this subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the “Contraindications” or “Warnings” section of the labeling and this subsection shall refer to it.</P>

              <P>(vii) If the sponsor believes that none of the statements described in paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi) of this <PRTPAGE P="65"/>section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s). FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling and that the alternative statement is accurate and appropriate.</P>
              <P>(viii) If the drug product contains one or more inactive ingredients that present an increased risk of toxic effects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups, a special note of this risk shall be made, generally in the “Contraindications,” “Warnings,” or “Precautions” section.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Geriatric use.</E> (i) A specific geriatric indication, if any, that is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the geriatric population shall be described under the “Indications and Usage” section of the labeling, and appropriate geriatric dosage shall be stated under the “Dosage and Administration” section of the labeling. The “Geriatric use” subsection shall cite any limitations on the geriatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with the geriatric indication, and other information related to the safe and effective use of the drug in the geriatric population. Unless otherwise noted, information contained in the “Geriatric use” subsection of the labeling shall pertain to use of the drug in persons 65 years of age and older. Data summarized in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under “Clinical Pharmacology” or the “Clinical Studies” section. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in “Contraindications,” “Warnings,” and elsewhere in “Precautions.”</P>
              <P>(ii) Specific statements on geriatric use of the drug for an indication approved for adults generally, as distinguished from a specific geriatric indication, shall be contained in the “Geriatric use” subsection and shall reflect all information available to the sponsor that is relevant to the appropriate use of the drug in elderly patients. This information includes detailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-documented studies obtained from a literature search. Controlled studies include those that are part of the marketing application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug application, new drug application, biological license application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applications (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The “Geriatric use” subsection shall contain the following statement(s) or reasonable alternative, as applicable, taking into account available information:</P>

              <P>(A) If clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the “Geriatric use” subsection shall include the following statement:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“Clinical studies of (name of drug) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(B) If clinical studies (including studies that are part of marketing applications and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor's applications) included enough elderly subjects to make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in safety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the “Geriatric use” subsection shall contain the following statement:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>

                <P>Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of (name of drug), _ percent were 65 and over, while _ percent were 75 and over. (Alternatively, the labeling may state the total number of subjects included in the <PRTPAGE P="66"/>studies who were 65 and over and 75 and over.) No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(C) If evidence from clinical studies and other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific monitoring or dosage adjustment, the “Geriatric use” subsection of the labeling shall contain a brief description of observed differences or specific monitoring or dosage requirements and, as appropriate, shall refer to more detailed discussions in the “Contraindications,” “Warnings,” “Dosage and Administration,” or other sections of the labeling.</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) If specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out in the elderly, they shall be described briefly in the “Geriatric use” subsection of the labeling and in detail under the “Clinical Pharmacology” section. The “Clinical Pharmacology” section and “Drug interactions” subsection of the “Precautions” section ordinarily contain information on drug-disease and drug-drug interactions that is particularly relevant to the elderly, who are more likely to have concomitant illness and to utilize concomitant drugs.</P>

              <P>(B) If a drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the “Geriatric use” subsection shall include the statement:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(iv) If use of the drug in the elderly appears to cause a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in the “Geriatric use” subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the “Contraindications,” “Warnings,” or “Precautions” section of the labeling, and the “Geriatric use” subsection shall refer to those sections.</P>

              <P>(v) Labeling under paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(iii) of this section may include statements, if they would be useful in enhancing safe use of the drug, that reflect good clinical practice or past experience in a particular situation, e.g., for a sedating drug, it could be stated that:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of (name of drug) and observed closely.”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(vi) If the sponsor believes that none of the requirements described in paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(v) of this section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose an alternative statement. FDA may permit omission of the statements if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling. FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if the agency determines that such statement is accurate and appropriate.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Adverse Reactions.</E> An adverse reaction is an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of the drug, that may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.</P>
              <P>(1) This section of the labeling shall list the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable.</P>

              <P>(2) In this listing, adverse reactions may be categorized by organ system, by severity of the reaction, by frequency, or by toxicological mechanism, or by a combination of these, as appropriate. If frequency information from adequate clinical studies is available, the categories and the adverse reactions within each category shall be listed in decreasing order of frequency. An adverse reaction that is significantly more severe than the other reactions listed in a category, however, shall be listed before those reactions, regardless of its frequency. If frequency information from adequate clinical studies is not available, the categories <PRTPAGE P="67"/>and adverse reactions within each category shall be listed in decreasing order of severity. The approximate frequency of each adverse reaction shall be expressed in rough estimates or orders of magnitude essentially as follows: “The most frequent adverse reaction(s) to (<E T="03">name of drug</E>) is (are) (<E T="03">list reactions</E>). This (these) occur(s) in about (e.g., one-third of patients; one in 30 patients; less than one-tenth of patients). Less frequent adverse reactions are (<E T="03">list reactions</E>), which occur in approximately (e.g., one in 100 patients). Other adverse reactions, which occur rarely, in approximately (e.g., one in 1,000 patients), are (<E T="03">list reactions</E>).” Percent figures may not ordinarily be used unless they are documented by adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter, they are shown to reflect general experience, and they do not falsely imply a greater degree of accuracy than actually exists.</P>
              <P>(3) The “Warnings” section of the labeling or, if appropriate, the “Contraindications” section of the labeling shall identify any potentially fatal adverse reaction.</P>
              <P>(4) Any claim comparing the drug to which the labeling applies with other drugs in terms of frequency, severity, or character of adverse reactions shall be based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under § 201.58 or § 314.126(c) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Drug Abuse and Dependence.</E> Under this section heading, the labeling shall contain the following subsections, as appropriate for the drug:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Controlled Substance.</E> If the drug is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the schedule in which it is controlled shall be stated.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Abuse.</E> This subsection of the labeling shall be based primarily on human data and human experience, but pertinent animal data may also be used. This subsection shall state the types of abuse that can occur with the drug and the adverse reactions pertinent to them. Particularly susceptible patient populations shall be identified.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Dependence.</E> This subsection of the labeling shall describe characteristic effects resulting from both psychological and physical dependence that occur with the drug and shall identify the quantity of the drug over a period of time that may lead to tolerance or dependence, or both. Details shall be provided on the adverse effects of chronic abuse and the effects of abrupt withdrawal. Procedures necessary to diagnose the dependent state shall be provided, and the principles of treating the effects of abrupt withdrawal shall be described.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Overdosage.</E> Under this section heading, the labeling shall describe the signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of acute overdosage and the general principles of treatment. This section shall be based on human data, when available. If human data are unavailable, appropriate animal and in vitro data may be used. Specific information shall be provided about the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings associated with an overdosage of the drug.</P>
              <P>(2) Complications that can occur with the drug (for example, organ toxicity or delayed acidosis).</P>
              <P>(3) Oral LD<E T="52">50</E> of the drug in animals; concentrations of the drug in biologic fluids associated with toxicity and/or death; physiologic variables influencing excretion of the drug, such as urine pH; and factors that influence the dose response relationship of the drug, such as tolerance. The pharmacokinetic data given in the “Clinical Pharmacology” section also may be referenced here, if applicable to overdoses.</P>
              <P>(4) The amount of the drug in a single dose that is ordinarily associated with symptoms of overdosage and the amount of the drug in a single dose that is likely to be life-threatening.</P>
              <P>(5) Whether the drug is dialyzable.</P>

              <P>(6) Recommended general treatment procedures and specific measures for support of vital functions, such as proven antidotes, gastric lavage, and forced diuresis. Unqualified recommendations for which data are lacking with the specific drug or class of drugs, especially treatment using another drug (for example, central nervous system stimulants, respiratory stimulants) may not be stated unless <PRTPAGE P="68"/>specific data or scientific rationale exists to support safe and effective use.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Dosage and Administration.</E> This section of the labeling shall state the recommended usual dose, the usual dosage range, and, if appropriate, an upper limit beyond which safety and effectiveness have not been established; dosages shall be stated for each indication when appropriate. Dosing regimens must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not included in this section. This section shall also state the intervals recommended between doses, the optimal method of titrating dosage, the usual duration of treatment, and any modification of dosage needed in special patient populations, e.g., in children, in geriatric age groups, or in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Specific tables or monographs may be included to clarify dosage schedules. Radiation dosimetry information shall be stated for both the patient receiving a radioactive drug and the person administering it. This section shall also contain specific direction on dilution, preparation (including the strength of the final dosage solution, when prepared according to instructions, in terms of milligrams active ingredient per milliliter of reconstituted solution, unless another measure of the strength is more appropriate), and administration of the dosage form, if needed, e.g., the rate of administration of parenteral drug in milligrams per minute; storage conditions for stability of the drug or reconstituted drug, when important; essential information on drug incompatibilities if the drug is mixed in vitro with other drugs; and the following statement for parenterals: “Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.”</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">How Supplied.</E> This section of the labeling shall contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is responsible. The information shall ordinarily include:</P>
              <P>(1) The strength of the dosage form, e.g., 10-milligram tablets, in metric system and, if the apothecary system is used, a statement of the strength is placed in parentheses after the metric designation;</P>
              <P>(2) The units in which the dosage form is ordinarily available for prescribing by practitioners, e.g., bottles of 100;</P>
              <P>(3) Appropriate information to facilitate identification of the dosage forms, such as shape, color, coating, scoring, and National Drug Code; and</P>
              <P>(4) Special handling and storage conditions.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Animal Pharmacology and/or Animal Toxicology.</E> In most cases, the labeling need not include this section. Significant animal data necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans shall ordinarily be included in one or more of the other sections of the labeling, as appropriate. Commonly for a drug that has been marketed for a long time, and in rare cases for a new drug, chronic animal toxicity studies have not been performed or completed for a drug that is administered over prolonged periods or is implanted in the body. The unavailability of such data shall be stated in the appropriate section of the labeling for the drug. If the pertinent animal data cannot be appropriately incorporated into other sections of the labeling, this section may be used.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">“Clinical Studies” and “References”.</E> These sections may appear in labeling in the place of a detailed discussion of a subject that is of limited interest but nonetheless important. A reference to a specific important clinical study may be made in any section of the format required under §§ 201.56 and 201.57 if the study is essential to an understandable presentation of the available information. References may appear in sections of the labeling format, other than the “Clinical Studies” or “References” section, in rare circumstances only. A clinical study or reference may be cited in prescription drug labeling only under the following conditions:</P>

              <P>(1)(i) If the clinical study is cited in the labeling in place of a detailed discussion of data and information concerning an indication for use of the drug, the clinical study must constitute an adequate and well-controlled study as described in § 314.126(b) of this <PRTPAGE P="69"/>chapter, except for biological products, and must not imply or suggest indications or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the “Indications and Usage” or “Dosage and Administration” section.</P>
              <P>(ii) When prescription drug labeling must summarize or otherwise rely on a recommendation by an authoritative scientific body, or on a standardized methodology, scale, or technique, because the information is important to prescribing decisions, the labeling may include a reference to the source of the information.</P>
              <P>(2) If the clinical study or reference is cited in the labeling in the place of a detailed discussion of data and information concerning a risk or risks from the use of the drug, the risk or risks shall also be identified or discussed in the appropriate section of the labeling for the drug.</P>

              <P>A drug subject to the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the act shall be exempt from section 502(f)(1) if all the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(a) The drug is:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) In the possession of a person (or his agents or employees) regularly and lawfully engaged in the manufacture, transportation, storage, or wholesale distribution of prescription drugs; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the possession of a retail, hospital, or clinic pharmacy, or a public health agency, regularly and lawfully engaged in dispensing prescription drugs; or</P>
              <P>(iii) In the possession of a practitioner licensed by law to administer or prescribe such drugs; and</P>
              <P>(2) It is to be dispensed in accordance with section 503(b)</P>
              <P>(b) The label of the drug bears:</P>
              <P>(1) The statement “Rx only” and</P>
              <P>(2) The recommended or usual dosage and</P>

              <P>(ii) Color additives may be designated as coloring without naming specific color components unless the naming of such components is required by a color additive regulation prescribed in subchapter A of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Trace amounts of harmless substances added solely for individual product identification need not be named. If it is intended for administration by parenteral injection, the quantity or proportion of all inactive ingredients, except that ingredients added to adjust the pH or to make the drug isotonic may be declared by name and a statement of their effect; and if the vehicle is water for injection it need not be named.</P>
              <P>(6) An identifying lot or control number from which it is possible to determine the complete manufacturing history of the package of the drug.</P>

              <P>(7) A statement directed to the pharmacist specifying the type of container to be used in dispensing the drug product to maintain its identity, strength, quality, and purity. Where there are standards and test procedures for determining that the container meets the requirements for specified types of containers as defined in an official compendium, such terms may be used. For example, “Dispense in tight, light-resistant container as defined in the National Formulary”. Where standards and test procedures for determining the types of containers to be used in dispensing the drug product are not included in an official compendium, the specific container or types of containers known to be adequate to maintain the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug products shall be described. For example, “Dispense <PRTPAGE P="70"/>in containers which (statement of specifications which clearly enable the dispensing pharmacist to select an adequate container)”: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That in the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear all such information, but which are packaged within an outer container from which they are removed for dispensing or use, the information required by paragraph (b) (2), (3), (5), and (7) of this section may be contained in other labeling on or within the package from which it is to be dispensed; the information referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be placed on such outer container only; and the information required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section may be on the crimp of the dispensing tube. The information required by this paragraph (b)(7) is not required for prescription drug products packaged in unit-dose, unit-of-use, on other packaging format in which the manufacturer's original package is designed and intended to be dispensed to patients without repackaging.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions under which practitioners licensed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, including all purposes for which it is advertised or represented; and</P>
              <P>(2) If the article is subject to section 505 of the act, the labeling bearing such information is the labeling authorized by the approved new drug application or required as a condition for the certification or the exemption from certification requirements applicable to preparations of insulin or antibiotic drugs.</P>
              <P>(d) Any labeling, as defined in section 201(m) of the act, whether or not it is on or within a package from which the drug is to be dispensed, distributed by or on behalf of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug, that furnishes or purports to furnish information for use or which prescribes, recommends, or suggests a dosage for the use of the drug (other than dose information required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section and § 201.105(b)(2) contains:</P>
              <P>(1) Adequate information for such use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions, under which practitioners licensed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, including all conditions for which it is advertised or represented; and if the article is subject to section 505 of the act, the parts of the labeling providing such information are the same in language and emphasis as labeling approved or permitted, under the provisions of section 505, and any other parts of the labeling are consistent with and not contrary to such approved or permitted labeling; and</P>
              <P>(2) The same information concerning the ingredients of the drug as appears on the label and labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed.</P>
              <P>(3) The information required, and in the format specified, by §§ 201.56, 201.57, and 201.80.</P>
              <P>(e) All labeling described in paragraph (d) of this section bears conspicuously the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, as required for the label of the drug under § 201.1.</P>

              <P>(f) Reminder labeling which calls attention to the name of the drug product but does not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug product is exempted from the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. This reminder labeling shall contain only the proprietary name of the drug product, if any; the established name of the drug product, if any; the established name of each active ingredient in the drug product; and, optionally, information relating to quantitative ingredient statements, dosage form, quantity of package contents, price, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor or other written, printed, or graphic matter containing no representation or suggestion relating to the drug product. If <PRTPAGE P="71"/>the Commissioner finds that there is evidence of significant incidence of fatalities or serious injury associated with the use of a particular prescription drug, he may withdraw this exemption by so notifying the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug by letter. Reminder labeling, other than price lists and catalogs solely intended to convey price information including, but not limited to, those subject to the requirements of § 200.200 of this chapter, is not permitted for a prescription drug product whose labeling contains a boxed warning relating to a serious hazard associated with the use of the drug product. Reminder labeling which is intended to provide consumers with information concerning the price charged for a prescription for a particular drug product shall meet all of the conditions contained in § 200.200 of this chapter. Reminder labeling, other than that subject to the requirements of § 200.200 of this chapter, is not permitted for a drug for which an announcement has been published pursuant to a review of the labeling claims for the drug by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, and for which no claim has been evaluated as higher than “possibly effective.” If the Commissioner finds the circumstances are such that reminder labeling may be misleading to prescribers of drugs subject to NAS/NRC evaluation, such reminder labeling will not be allowed and the manufacturer, packer, or distributor will be notified either in the publication of the conclusions on the effectiveness of the drug or by letter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disclosure of drug efficacy study evaluations in labeling and advertising.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, has completed an exhaustive review of labeling claims made for drugs marketed under new-drug and antibiotic drug procedures between 1938 and 1962. The results are compiled in “Drug Efficacy Study, A Report to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs from the National Academy of Sciences (1969).” As the report notes, this review has made “an audit of the state of the art of drug usage that has been uniquely extensive in scope and uniquely intensive in time” and is applicable to more than 80 percent of the currently marketed drugs. The report further notes that the quality of the evidence of efficacy, as well as the quality of the labeling claims, is poor. Labeling and other promotional claims have been evaluated as “effective,” “probably effective,” “possibly effective,” “ineffective,” “ineffective as a fixed combination,” and “effective but,” and a report for each drug in the study has been submitted to the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(2) The Food and Drug Administration is processing the reports, seeking voluntary action on the part of the drug manufacturers and distributors in the elimination or modification of unsupported promotional claims, and initiating administrative actions as necessary to require product and labeling changes.</P>
              <P>(3) Delays have been encountered in bringing to the attention of the prescribers of prescription items the conclusions of the expert panels that reviewed the promotional claims.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that:</P>
              <P>(1) The failure to disclose in the labeling of a drug and in other promotional material the conclusions of the Academy experts that a claim is “ineffective,” “possibly effective,” “probably effective,” or “ineffective as a fixed combination,” while labeling and promotional material bearing any such claim are being used, is a failure to disclose facts that are material in light of the representations made and causes the drug to be misbranded.</P>
              <P>(2) The Academy classification of a drug as other than “effective” for a claim for which such drug is recommended establishes that there is a material weight of opinion among qualified experts contrary to the representation made or suggested in the labeling, and failure to reveal this fact causes such labeling to be misleading.</P>
              <P>(c) Therefore, after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of a Drug Efficacy Study Implementation notice on a prescription drug, unless exempted or otherwise provided for in the notice, all <PRTPAGE P="78"/>package labeling (other than the immediate container or carton label, unless such labeling contains information required by § 201.100(c)(1) in lieu of a package insert), promotional labeling, and advertisements shall include, as part of the information for practitioners under which the drug can be safely and effectively used, an appropriate qualification of all claims evaluated as other than “effective” by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, if such claims continue to be included in either the labeling or advertisements. However, this qualifying information will be required in advertisements only if promotional material is included therein for claims evaluated as less than “effective” or if such claims are included in the indications section of the portion of the advertisement containing the information required in brief summary by § 202.1(e)(1) of this chapter. When, however, the Food and Drug Administration classification of such claim is “effective” (for example, on the basis of revision of the language of the claim or submission or existence of adequate data), such qualification is not necessary. When the Food and Drug Administration classification of the claim, as stated in the implementation notice, differs from that of the Academy but is other than “effective,” the qualifying statement shall refer to this classification in lieu of the Academy's classification.</P>

              <P>(d) For new drugs and antibiotics, supplements to provide for revised labeling in accord with paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted under the provisions of § 314.70 and § 514.8 of this chapter within 90 days after publication of the implementation notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or by May 15, 1972, for those drugs for which notices have been published and such labeling shall be put into use as soon as possible but not later than the end of the time period allowed for submitting supplements to provide for revised labeling.</P>
              <P>(e) Qualifying information required in drug labeling by paragraph (c) of this section in order to advise prescribers of a drug of the findings made by a panel of the Academy in evaluating a claim as other than “effective” shall be at least of the same size and color and degree of prominence as other printing in the labeling and shall be presented in a prominent box using one of the following formats and procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) In drug labeling the box statement may entirely replace the indications section and be in the following format:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of glandular preparations.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Under date of December 4, 1941, in a notice to manufacturers of glandular preparations, the Food and Drug Administration expressed the opinion that preparations of inert glandular materials intended for medicinal use should, in view of the requirement of section 201(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (52 Stat. 1041; 21 U.S.C. 321(n)), be labeled with a statement of the material fact that there is no scientific evidence that the articles contain any therapeutic or physiologically active constituents. Numerous preparations of such inert glandular materials were subsequently marketed with disclaimers of the type suggested. The term <E T="03">inert glandular materials</E> means preparations incapable of exerting an action or effect of some significant or measurable benefit in one way or another, i.e., in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or in affecting the structure or any function of the body.</P>
              <P>(b) Manufacturers have heretofore taken advantage of § 201.100 permitting omission of directions for use when the label bears the prescription legend. Section 201.100(c) requires that the labeling of the drug, which may include brochures readily available to licensed practitioners, bear information as to the use of the drug by practitioners licensed by law to administer it. Obviously, information adequate for the use of an inert glandular preparation is not available to practitioners licensed by law.</P>

              <P>(c) The Department of Health and Human Services is of the opinion that inert glandular materials may not be exempted from the requirements of <PRTPAGE P="80"/>section 502(f)(1) of the act that they bear adequate directions for use; and, accordingly, that their labeling must include among other things, representations as to the conditions for which such articles are intended to be used or as to the structure or function of the human body that they are intended to affect. Since any such representations offering these articles for use as drugs would be false or misleading, such articles will be considered to be misbranded if they are distributed for use as drugs.</P>
              <P>(d) The amended regulations provide also that in the case of drugs intended for parenteral administration there shall be no exemption from the requirement that their labelings bear adequate directions for use. Such inert glandular materials for parenteral use are therefore subject to the same comment as applies to those intended for oral administration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of estrogenic hormone preparations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Some drug preparations fabricated wholly or in part from estradiol and labeled as to potency in terms of international units or in terms of international units of estrone activity have been marketed. The international unit of the estrus-producing hormone was established by the International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones at London, England, on August 1, 1932. This unit was defined as “the specific estrus-producing activity contained in 0.1 gamma ( = 0.0001 mg.) of the standard” hydroxyketonic hormone found in urine (estrone). The International Conference declared that it did not recommend the determination of the activity of nonhydroxyketonic forms of estrogenic hormones in units of estrone because of the varying ratios between the activity of such nonhydroxyketonic estrogenic hormones and estrone, when measured by different methods on test animals. There is no international unit for measuring the activity of estradiol and no accepted relationship between its activity and that of estrone, either in test animals or in humans. The declaration of potency of estradiol in terms of international units or in terms of international units of estrone activity is therefore considered misleading, within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 352(a). The declaration of the estradiol content of an estrogenic hormone preparation in terms of weight is considered appropriate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of drugs for internal use which contain mineral oil.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In the past few years research studies have altered medical opinion as to the usefulness and harmfulness of mineral oil in the human body. These studies have indicated that when mineral oil is used orally near mealtime it interferes with absorption from the digestive tract of provitamin A and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K, and consequently interferes with the utilization of calcium and phosphorus, with the result that the user is left liable to deficiency diseases. When so used in pregnancy it predisposes to hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.</P>
              <P>(b) There is accumulated evidence that the indiscriminate administration of mineral oil to infants may be followed by aspiration of the mineral oil and subsequent “lipoid pneumonia.”</P>
              <P>(c) In view of these facts, the Department of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act a drug for oral administration consisting in whole or in part of mineral oil, the labeling of which encourages its use in pregnancy or indicates or implies that such drug is for administration to infants.</P>
              <P>(d) It is also this Department's view that the act requires the labelings of such drugs to bear a warning against consumption other than at bedtime and against administration to infants. The following form of warning is suggested: “Caution: To be taken only at bedtime. Do not use at any other time or administer to infants, except upon the advice of a physician.”</P>
              <P>(e) This statement of interpretation does not in any way exempt mineral oil or preparations containing mineral oil from complying in all other respects with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Labeling of drug preparations containing significant proportions of wintergreen oil.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Because methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil) manifests no toxicity in the minute amounts in which it is used as a flavoring, it is mistakenly regarded by the public as harmless even when taken in substantially larger amounts. Actually, it is quite toxic when taken in quantities of a teaspoonful or more. Wintergreen oil and preparations containing it have caused a number of deaths through accidental misuse by both adults and children. Children are particularly attracted by the odor and are likely to swallow these products when left within reach.</P>
              <P>(b) To safeguard against fatalities from this cause, the Department of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act any drug containing more than 5 percent methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil), the labeling of which fails to warn that use otherwise than as directed therein may be dangerous and that the article should be kept out of reach of children to prevent accidental poisoning.</P>
              <P>(c) This statement of interpretation in no way exempts methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil) or its preparations from complying in all other respects with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tannic acid and barium enema preparations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It has become a widespread practice for tannic acid to be added to barium enemas to improve X-ray pictures. Tannic acid is capable of causing diminished liver function and severe liver necrosis when absorbed in sufficient amounts. The medical literature reports a number of deaths associated with the addition of tannic acid to barium enemas. There is a lack of scientific evidence to establish the conditions, if any, under which tannic acid is safe and effective for use in enemas. Tannic acid for rectal use to enhance X-ray visualization is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

              <P>(b) In view of the hazards involved when tannic acid is used in barium enemas, any shipments of tannic acid labeled to come within the exemptions under 502(f) of the Act containing such phrases as: “Caution: For manufacturing, processing, or repackaging,” “For prescription compounding,” or “Diagnostic reagent—For professional use only” will be regarded by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs as misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless the label and the labeling bear conspicuously a warning to the effect: “<E T="03">Warning—</E> Not for use in enemas.”</P>

              <P>(c) Any tannic acid intended for use by man and found within the jurisdiction of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act labeled contrary to this section after 60 days from the date of its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> may be made the subject of regulatory proceedings.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Isoproterenol inhalation preparations (pressurized aerosols, nebulizers, powders) for human use; warnings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Accumulating reports have been received by the Food and Drug Administration and have appeared in the medical literature of severe paradoxical bronchoconstriction associated with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations in the treatment of bronchial asthma and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders. The cause of this paradoxical reaction is unknown; it has been observed, however, that patients have not responded completely to other forms of therapy until use of the isoproterenol inhalation preparation was discontinued. In addition, sudden unexpected deaths have been associated with the excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations. The mechanism of these deaths and their relationship, if any, to the cases of severe paradoxical bronchospasm are not clear. Cardiac arrest was noted in several of these cases of sudden death.</P>

              <P>(b) On the basis of the above information and after discussion with and concurrence of the Respiratory and Anesthetic Drugs Advisory Committee for Food and Drug Administration, the <PRTPAGE P="82"/>Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that in order for the labeling of such drugs to bear adequate information for their safe use, as required by § 201.100, such labeling must include the following:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Warning:</E> Occasional patients have been reported to develop severe paradoxical airway resistance with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations. The cause of this refractory state is unknown. It is advisable that in such instances the use of this preparation be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted, since in the reported cases the patients did not respond to other forms of therapy until the drug was withdrawn.</P>
                <P>Deaths have been reported following excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations and the exact cause is unknown. Cardiac arrest was noted in several instances.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(c)(1) The Commissioner also concludes that in view of the manner in which these preparations are self-administered for relief of attacks of bronchial asthma and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders, it is necessary for the protection of users that warning information to patients be included as a part of the label and as part of any instructions to patients included in the package dispensed to the patient as follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>

              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(2) The warning on the label may be accomplished (i) by including it on the immediate container label with a statement directed to pharmacists not to remove the label or (ii) by including in the package a printed warning with instructions to pharmacists to place the warning on the container prior to dispensing.</P>
              <P>(d) The marketing of isoproterenol inhalation preparations may be continued if all the following conditions are met:</P>

These lesions may occur with enteric-coated potassium tablets alone or when they are used with nonenteric-coated thiazides, or certain other oral diuretics. These small-bowel lesions have caused obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation. Surgery was frequently required and deaths have occurred. Based on a large survey of physicians and hospitals, both United States and foreign, the incidence of these lesions is low, and a causal relationship in man has not been definitely established. Available information tends to implicate enteric-coated potassium salts, although lesions of this type also occur spontaneously. Therefore, coated potassium-containing formulations should be administered only when indicated, and should be discontinued immediately if abdominal pain, distention, nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding occur.

              <P>(a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that multiple container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution available in the marketplace have caused consumer confusion and appear to have been involved in several consumer deaths. Sodium phosphates oral solution has been marketed in 45-milliliter (mL), 90-mL, and 240-mL container sizes. The 45-mL and 90-mL container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution are often recommended and prescribed by physicians for bowel cleansing prior to surgery and diagnostic procedures of the colon. Sodium phosphates oral solution (adult dose 20 mL to 45 mL) is also used as an over-the-counter (OTC) laxative for the relief of occasional constipation. Accidental overdosing and deaths have occurred because the 240-mL container was mistakenly used instead of the 45-mL or 90-mL container. The Food and Drug Administration is limiting the amount of sodium phosphates oral solution to not more than 90 mL (3 ounces (oz)) per OTC container because of the serious health risks associated with the ingestion of larger than intended doses of this product. Further, <PRTPAGE P="84"/>because an overdose of either oral or rectal enema sodium phosphates can cause an electrolyte imbalance, additional warning and direction statements are required for the safe use of any OTC laxative drug product containing sodium phosphates.</P>
              <P>(b) Any OTC drug product for laxative or bowel cleansing use containing sodium phosphates as an active ingredient when marketed as described in paragraph (a) of this section is misbranded within the meaning of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless packaged and labeled as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Package size limitation for sodium phosphates oral solution: Container shall not contain more than 90 mL (3 oz).</P>

See Warnings.”</P>
              <P>(ii) For products containing dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate identified in § 334.16(d) marketed as a solution. Adults and children 12 years of age and over: Oral dosage is dibasic sodium phosphate 3.42 to 7.56 grams (g) and monobasic sodium phosphate 9.1 to 20.2 g (20 to 45 mL dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. “Do not take more than 45 mL (9 teaspoonfuls or 3 tablespoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.” Children 10 and 11 years of age: Oral dosage is dibasic sodium phosphate 1.71 to 3.78 g and monobasic sodium phosphate 4.5 to 10.1 g (10 to 20 mL dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. “Do not take more than 20 mL (4 teaspoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.” Children 5 to 9 years of age: Oral dosage is dibasic sodium phosphate 0.86 to 1.89 g and monobasic sodium phosphate 2.2 to 5.05 g (5 to 10 mL dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. “Do not take more than 10 mL (2 teaspoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.” Children under 5 years of age: ask a doctor.</P>
              <P>(c) After June 22, 1998, for package size limitation and September 18, 1998, for labeling in accord with paragraph (b) of this section, any such OTC drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, or any such drug product that is repackaged or relabeled after these dates regardless of the date the product was manufactured, initially introduced, or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.</P>

The immediate availability of this drug for use in such situations is critical, since rapid treatment may be the difference between life and death. The restriction of this drug to prescription sale limits its availability in emergencies. On the other hand, it is the consensus of informed medical opinion that ipecac syrup should be used only under medical supervision in the emergency treatment of poisonings. In view of these facts, the question of whether ipecac syrup labeled as an emergency treatment for use in poisonings should be available over the counter has been controversial.</P>

              <P>(b) In connection with its study of this problem, the Food and Drug Administration has obtained the views of medical authorities. It is the unanimous recommendation of the American <PRTPAGE P="85"/>Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the American Medical Association, and the Medical Advisory Board of the Food and Drug Administration that ipecac syrup in 1 fluid ounce containers be permitted to be sold without prescription so that it will be readily available in the household for emergency treatment of poisonings, under medical supervision, and that the drug be appropriately packaged and labeled for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(c) In view of the above recommendations, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that it is in the interest of the public health for ipecac syrup to be available for sale without prescription, provided that it is packaged in a quantity of 1 fluid ounce (30 milliliters), and its label bears, in addition to other required label information, the following, in a prominent and conspicuous manner:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement conspicuously boxed and in red letters, to the effect: “For emergency use to cause vomiting in poisoning. Before using, call physician, the Poison Control Center, or hospital emergency room immediately for advice.”</P>
              <P>(2) A warning to the effect: “Warning—Keep out of reach of children. Do not use in unconscious persons. Ordinarily, this drug should not be used if strychnine, corrosives such as alkalies (lye) and strong acids, or petroleum distillates such as kerosine, gasoline, coal oil, fuel oil, paint thinner, or cleaning fluid have been ingested.”</P>
              <P>(3) Usual dosage: 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) in persons over 1 year of age.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations; necessary warning statement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In 1961, the Food and Drug Administration, pursuant to its statutory responsibility for the safety and effectiveness of drugs shipped in interstate commerce, began an active investigation of reports of possible toxic effects and renal damage due to misuse of the drug acetophenetidin. This study led to the decision that there was probable cause to conclude that misuse and prolonged use of the drug were in fact responsible for kidney lesions and disease. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in December 1963, appointed an ad hoc Advisory Committee of Inquiry on Possible Nephrotoxicity Associated With the Abuse of Acetophenetidin (Phenacetin)-Containing Preparations. This committee, composed of scientists in the fields of pharmacology and medicine, on April 23, 1964, submitted its findings and conclusions in the matter and recommended that all acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations bear a warning as provided in section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(b) On the basis of the studies made by the Food and Drug Administration and the report of the Advisory Committee, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is necessary for the protection of users that the label and labeling of all acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations bear a warning statement to the following effect: “Warning—This medication may damage the kidneys when used in large amounts or for a long period of time. Do not take more than the recommended dosage, nor take regularly for longer than 10 days without consulting your physician.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>Phenindione; labeling of drug preparations intended for use by man.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that phenindione, a synthetic anticoagulant drug, has caused a number of cases of agranulocytosis (with two fatalities). There are also reports implicating the drug in cases of hepatitis and hypersensitivity reactions. In view of the potentially serious effects found to be associated with preparations of this drug intended for use by man, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will regard such preparations as misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f) (1) and (2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, unless the label and labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed, and any other labeling furnishing or purporting to furnish information for use of the drug, bear a conspicuous warning statement to the following effect: “Warning: Agranulocytosis and hepatitis have been associated with the use <PRTPAGE P="86"/>of phenindione. Patients should be instructed to report promptly prodromal symptoms such as marked fatigue, chill, fever, and sore throat. Periodic blood studies and liver function tests should be performed. Use of the drug should be discontinued if leukopenia occurs or if evidence of hypersensitivity, such as dermatitis or fever, appears.”</P>
              <P>(b) Regulatory action may be initiated with respect to preparations of phenindione intended for use by man found within the jurisdiction of the act on or after November 25, 1961, unless such preparations are labeled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Labeling of drug preparations containing salicylates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The label of any oral drug preparation intended for sale without prescription and which contains any salicylate ingredient (including aspirin, salicylamide, other salicylates, and combinations) must conspicuously bear, on a clearly contrasting background, the warning statement: “Keep out of reach of children [highlighted in bold type]. In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away,” or “Keep out of reach of children [highlighted in bold type],” except that if the article is an aspirin preparation, it shall bear the first of these warning statements. Such a warning statement is required for compliance with section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and is intended to guard against accidental poisonings. Safety closures that prevent access to the drug by young children are also recommended to guard against accidental poisonings.</P>
              <P>(b) Effervescent preparations and preparations containing para-aminosalicylate as the only salicylate ingredient are exempted from this labeling requirement.</P>
              <P>(c) Aspirin tablets sold as such and containing no other active ingredients, except tablets which cannot be readily subdivided into a child's dose because of their coating or size, should always bear dosage directions for each age group down to 3 years of age, with a statement such as “For children under 3 years of age, consult your physician.” It is recommended that:</P>
              <P>(1) Aspirin tablets especially made for pediatric use be produced only in 1<FR>1/4</FR>-grain size to reduce the hazard of errors in dosage;</P>
              <P>(2) By June 1, 1967, manufacturers and distributors of 1<FR>1/4</FR>-grain size aspirin tablets discontinue the distribution of such tablets in retail containers containing more than 36 tablets, to reduce the hazard of accidental poisoning;</P>
              <P>(3) The flavoring of 5-grain aspirin tablets or other “adult aspirin tablets” be discontinued; and</P>
              <P>(4) Labeling giving undue emphasis to the pleasant flavor of flavored aspirin tablets be discontinued.</P>
              <P>(d) Salicylate preparations other than aspirin tablets sold as such may, at the option of the distributor, be labeled for use by adults only. If their labeling and advertising clearly offer them for administration to adults only.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) It is the obligation of the distributor who labels a salicylate preparation for administration to children to make certain that the article is suitable for such use and labeled with adequate directions for use in the age group for which it is offered, but in no <PRTPAGE P="87"/>case should such an article bear directions for use in children under 3 years of age. If the directions provide for administration to children as young as 3 years of age, the label should bear the statement, “For children under 3 years of age consult your physician.” However, if the directions provide for administration to children only of an age greater than 3 years (for example, the dosage instructions provide for administration of the article to children only down to age 6), the label should bear a statement such as, “For younger children consult your physician.”</P>
              <P>(2) A statement such as, “For children under 3 years of age consult your physician” or “For younger children consult your physician” is not required on the label of an article clearly offered for administration to adults only.</P>
              <P>(f) If the labeling or advertising of a salicylate preparation offers it for use in arthritis or rheumatism, the label and labeling should clearly state that the beneficial effects claimed are limited to: “For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of arthritis and rheumatism.” The qualifying phrase “for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains” should appear with the same degree of prominence and conspicuousness as the phrase “arthritis and rheumatism”. The label and labeling should bear in juxtaposition with such directions for use conspicuous warning statements to the effect: “Caution: If pain persists for more than 10 days, or redness is present, or in conditions affecting children under 12 years of age, consult a physician immediately.” The salicylate dosage should not exceed 60 grains in a 24-hour period or 10 grains in a 4-hour period. If the article contains other analgesics, the salicylate dosage should be appropriately reduced.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) The label of any drug containing more than 5 percent methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil) should bear a conspicuous warning such as: “Do not use otherwise than as directed.” These drug products must also include the “Keep out of reach of children” warning and the accidental ingestion warning as required in § 330.1(g) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) If the preparation is a counterirritant or rubefacient, it should also bear a caution such as, “Caution: Discontinue use if excessive irritation of the skin develops. Avoid getting into the eyes or on mucous membranes.” (See also § 201.303.)</P>
              <P>(h)(1) The labeling of orally or rectally administered over-the-counter drug products containing aspirin or nonaspirin salicylates as active ingredients subject to this paragraph is required to prominently bear the following warning: “Reye's syndrome [subheading in bold type]: Children and teenagers who have or are recovering from chicken pox or flu-like symptoms should not use this product. When using this product, if changes in behavior with nausea and vomiting occur, consult a doctor because these symptoms could be an early sign of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious illness.”</P>
              <P>(2) This warning statement shall appear on the immediate container labeling. In cases where the immediate container is not the retail package, the retail package also must bear the warning statement. In addition, the warning statement shall appear on any labeling that contains warnings and, in such cases, the warning statement shall be the first warning statement under the heading “Warnings.”</P>
              <P>(3) Over-the-counter drug products subject to this paragraph and labeled solely for use by children (pediatric products) shall not recommend the product for use in treating flu or chicken pox.</P>
              <P>(4) Any product subject to paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2), and (h)(3) of this section that is not labeled as required by these paragraphs and that is initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce after the following dates is misbranded under sections 201(n) and 502(a) and (f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance by October 18, 2004, for OTC drug products containing aspirin and nonaspirin salicylates as an active ingredient and marketed under a new drug application or abbreviated new drug application.</P>

              <P>(ii) Compliance by April 19, 2004, for OTC antidiarrheal and overindulgence drug products that contain bismuth subsalicylate as an active ingredient <PRTPAGE P="88"/>and have annual sales greater than $25,000.</P>
              <P>(iii) Compliance by April 18, 2005, for OTC antidiarrheal and overindulgence drug products that contain bismuth subsalicylate as an active ingredient and have annual sales less than $25,000.</P>

              <P>(iv) Compliance dates for all other OTC drug products containing aspirin and nonaspirin salicylates as an active ingredient and marketed under an OTC drug monograph (for internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, or for menstrual drug products) will be established when the final monographs for those products are published in a future issue of the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> In the interim, these products should continue to be labeled with the previous Reye's syndrome warning that appears in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that esophageal obstruction and asphyxiation have been associated with the ingestion of water-soluble gums, hydrophilic gums, and hydrophilic mucilloids including, but not limited to, agar, alginic acid, calcium polycarbophil, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, carrageenan, chondrus, glucomannan ((B-1,4 linked) polymannose acetate), guar gum, karaya gum, kelp, methylcellulose, plantago seed (psyllium), polycarbophil, tragacanth, and xanthan gum. Esophageal obstruction and asphyxiation due to orally-administered drug products containing water-soluble gums, hydrophilic gums, and hydrophilic mucilloids as active ingredients are significant health risks when these products are taken without adequate fluid or when they are used by individuals with esophageal narrowing or dysfunction, or with difficulty in swallowing. Additional labeling is needed for the safe and effective use of any OTC drug product for human use containing a water-soluble gum, hydrophilic gum, or hydrophilic mucilloid as an active ingredient when marketed in a dry or incompletely hydrated form to include, but not limited to, the following dosage forms: Capsules, granules, powders, tablets, and wafers. Granular dosage forms containing psyllium are not generally recognized as safe and effective as OTC laxatives (see § 310.545(a)(12)(i)(B) of this chapter) and may not be marketed without an approved new drug application because the warnings and directions in paragraph (b) of this section have been found inadequate for these products.</P>

              <P>(a) The aluminum content of large volume parenteral (LVP) drug products used in total parenteral nutrition <PRTPAGE P="91"/>(TPN) therapy must not exceed 25 micrograms per liter (µg/L).</P>
              <P>(b) The package insert of LVP's used in TPN therapy must state that the drug product contains no more than 25 µg/L of aluminum. This information must be contained in the “Precautions” section of the labeling of all large volume parenterals used in TPN therapy.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum level of aluminum present at expiry must be stated on the immediate container label of all small volume parenteral (SVP) drug products and pharmacy bulk packages (PBPs) used in the preparation of TPN solutions. The aluminum content must be stated as follows: “Contains no more than __ µg/L of aluminum.” The immediate container label of all SVP's and PBP's that are lyophilized powders used in the preparation of TPN solutions must contain the following statement: “When reconstituted in accordance with the package insert instructions, the concentration of aluminum will be no more than __ µg/L.” This maximum level of aluminum must be stated as the highest of:</P>
              <P>(1) The highest level for the batches produced during the last 3 years;</P>
              <P>(2) The highest level for the latest five batches, or</P>
              <P>(3) The maximum historical level, but only until completion of production of the first five batches after July 26, 2004.</P>
              <P>(d) If the maximum level of aluminum is 25 µg/L or less, instead of stating the exact amount of aluminum as required in paragraph (c) of this section, the immediate container label may state: “Contains no more than 25 µg/L of aluminum.” If the SVP or PBP is a lyophilized powder, the immediate container label may state: “When reconstituted in accordance with the package insert instructions, the concentration of aluminum will be no more than 25 µg/L”.</P>

              <P>(e) The package insert for all LVP's, all SVP's, and PBP's used in TPN must contain a warning statement. This warning must be contained in the “Warnings” section of the labeling. The warning must state:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</P>
                <P>Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 µg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(f) Applicants and manufacturers must use validated assay methods to determine the aluminum content in parenteral drug products. The assay methods must comply with current good manufacturing practice requirements. Applicants must submit to the Food and Drug Administration validation of the method used and release data for several batches. Manufacturers of parenteral drug products not subject to an approved application must make assay methodology available to FDA during inspections. Holders of pending applications must submit an amendment under § 314.60 or § 314.96 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Over-the-counter drugs for vaginal contraceptive and spermicide use containing nonoxynol 9 as the active ingredient; required warnings and labeling information.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Studies indicate that use of vaginal contraceptive drug products containing nonoxynol 9 does not protect against infection from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or against the transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Studies also indicate that use of vaginal contraceptive drug products containing nonoxynol 9 can increase vaginal irritation, such as the disruption of the vaginal epithelium, and also can cause epithelial disruption when used in the rectum. These effects may increase the risk of transmission <PRTPAGE P="92"/>of the AIDS virus (HIV) from an infected partner. Therefore, consumers should be warned that these products do not protect against the transmission of the AIDS virus (HIV) or other STDs, that use of these products can increase vaginal and rectal irritation, which may increase the risk of getting the AIDS virus (HIV) from an HIV infected partner, and that the products are not for rectal use. Consumers should also be warned that these products should not be used by persons who have HIV/AIDS or are at high risk for HIV/AIDS.</P>
              <P>(b) The labeling of OTC vaginal contraceptive and spermicide drug products containing nonoxynol 9 as the active ingredient, whether subject to the ongoing OTC drug review or an approved drug application, must contain the following warnings under the heading “Warnings,” in accordance with 21 CFR 201.66.</P>
              <P>(1) “[bullet] For vaginal use only [bullet] Not for rectal (anal) use” [both warnings in bold type].</P>
              <P>(2) “Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) alert [in bold type]: This product does not [word “not” in bold type] protect against HIV/AIDS or other STDs and may increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected partner”.</P>
              <P>(3) “Do not use” [in bold type] if you or your sex partner has HIV/AIDS. If you do not know if you or your sex partner is infected, choose another form of birth control”.</P>
              <P>(4) “When using this product [in bold type] [optional, bullet] you may get vaginal irritation (burning, itching, or a rash)”.</P>
              <P>(5) “Stop use and ask a doctor if [in bold type] [optional, bullet] you or your partner get burning, itching, a rash, or other irritation of the vagina or penis”.</P>
              <P>(c) The labeling of this product states under the “Other information” section of the Drug Facts labeling in accordance with § 201.66(c)(7), “[bullet] when used correctly every time you have sex, latex condoms greatly reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</P>
              <P>(d) The labeling of this product includes the following statements either on the outside container or wrapper of the retail package, under the “Other information” section of the Drug Facts labeling in accordance with § 201.66(c)(7), or in a package insert:</P>
              <P>(1) “[bullet] studies have raised safety concerns that products containing the spermicide nonoxynol 9 can irritate the vagina and rectum. Sometimes this irritation has no symptoms. This irritation may increase the risk of getting HIV/AIDS from an infected partner”.</P>
              <P>(2) “[bullet] you can use nonoxynol 9 for birth control with or without a diaphragm or condom if you have sex with only one partner who is not infected with HIV and who has no other sexual partners or HIV risk factors”.</P>
              <P>(3) “[bullet] use a latex condom without nonoxynol 9 if you or your sex partner has HIV/AIDS, multiple sex partners, or other HIV risk factors”.</P>
              <P>(4) “[bullet] ask a health professional if you have questions about your best birth control and STD prevention methods”.</P>
              <P>(e) Any drug product subject to this section that is not labeled as required and that is initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce after June 19, 2008, is misbranded under section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 352), is a new drug under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355), and is subject to regulatory action.</P>

You may obtain a copy from the ISO Copyright Office, Case Postale 56, CH-1211, Geneva 20, Switzerland, telephone +41-22-749-01-11 or fax +41-22-74-09-47. <E T="03">http://www.iso.org.</E> You may inspect a copy at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 22, Silver Spring, MD 20993, call 301-796-2090, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www/archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</E> The solar simulator output should be measured before and after each phototest or, at a minimum, at the beginning and end of each test day. This radiometer should be calibrated using side-by-side comparison with the spectroradiometer (using the weighting factors determined according to paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) of this section) at the time of the annual spectroradiometric measurement of the solar simulator as described in paragraph (i)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Operation.</E> A solar simulator should have no significant time-related fluctuations (within 20 percent) in radiation emissions after an appropriate warm-up time and demonstrate good beam uniformity (within 20 percent) in the exposure plane. The delivered dose to the UV exposure site must be within 10 percent of the expected dose.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Periodic measurement.</E> To ensure that the solar simulator delivers the appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, the emission spectrum of the solar simulator should be measured at least annually with an appropriate and accurately calibrated spectroradiometer system (results should be traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Technology). In addition, the solar simulator must be recalibrated if there is any change in the lamp bulb or the optical filtering components (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> filters, mirrors, lenses, collimating devices, or focusing devices). Daily solar simulator radiation intensity should be monitored with a broadband radiometer with a response weighted to match the erythema action spectrum in ISO 17166 CIE S 007/E entitled “Erythemal reference action spectrum and standard erythema dose,” which is incorporated by reference in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. If a lamp must be replaced due to failure or aging during a phototest, broadband device readings consistent with those obtained for the original calibrated lamp will suffice until measurements can be performed with the spectroradiometer at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Medical history.</E> (A) Obtain a medical history from each subject with emphasis on the effects of sunlight on the subject's skin. Determine that each subject is in good general health with skin type I, II, or III as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Always burns easily; never tans (sensitive).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Always burns easily; tans minimally (sensitive).</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Never burns; deeply pigmented (insensitive).</P>
              <P>(B) Skin type is based on first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure after a winter season of no sun exposure. Determine that each subject is not taking topical or systemic medication that is known to alter responses to UV radiation. Determine that each subject has no history of sensitivities to topical products and/or abnormal responses to sunlight, such as a phototoxic or photoallergic response.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Physical examination.</E> Conduct a physical examination to determine the presence of sunburn, suntan, scars, active dermal lesions, and uneven skin tones on the areas of the back to be tested. A suitable source of low power UVA, such as a Woods lamp, is helpful in this process. If any of these conditions are present, the subject is not qualified to participate in the study. The presence of nevi, blemishes, or moles will be acceptable if, in the physician's judgment, they will neither compromise the study nor jeopardize a subject's safety. Subjects with dysplastic nevi should not be enrolled. Excess hair on the back is acceptable if the hair is clipped. Shaving is unacceptable because it may remove a significant portion of the stratum corneum and temporarily alter the skin's response to UV radiation.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Informed consent.</E> Obtain legally effective written informed consent from all test subjects.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Sunscreen application.</E> (i) <E T="03">Test site.</E> Test sites are locations on each subject's back, between the beltline and the shoulder blades (scapulae) and lateral to the midline, where skin responses to UV radiation are determined. Responses on unprotected skin (no test material applied) and protected skin (sunscreen test product(s) or SPF standard applied) are determined at separate unprotected and protected test sites, respectively. Test sites should be randomly located in a blinded manner. Each test site should be a minimum of 30 square centimeters and outlined with indelible ink.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Test subsite.</E> Test subsites are the locations to which UV radiation is administered within a test site. At least five test subsites should receive UV doses within each test site. Test subsites should be at least 0.5 square centimeters (cm<SU>2</SU>) in area and should be separated from each other by at least 0.8 cm. Each test subsite should be outlined with indelible ink.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Applying test materials.</E> Apply the sunscreen test product and the SPF standard at 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm<SU>2</SU>) to their respective test sites. Use a finger cot compatible with the sunscreen to spread the product as evenly as possible.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Waiting period.</E> Wait at least 15 minutes after applying a sunscreen product before exposing the test sites to UV radiation as described in paragraph (i)(5)) of this section. For water resistant sunscreen products, proceed with the water resistance testing procedure described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section after waiting at least 15 minutes.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">UV exposure</E>—(i) <E T="03">Definition of minimal erythema dose (MED).</E> The minimal erythema dose (MED) is the smallest UV dose that produces perceptible redness of the skin (erythema) with clearly defined borders at 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The MED for unprotected skin (MED<E T="52">u</E>) is determined on a test site that does not have sunscreen applied. The MED for protected skin (MED<E T="52">p</E>) is determined on a test site <PRTPAGE P="102"/>that has sunscreen applied. An MED<E T="52">p</E> is determined for the SPF standard (ssMED<E T="52">p</E>). An MED<E T="52">p</E> is determined for the sunscreen test product (tpMED<E T="52">p</E>).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">UV exposure for initial</E> MED<E T="52">u</E>. For each test subject, administer a series of UV radiation doses expressed as J/m<SU>2</SU>-eff (as determined according to paragraph (a)(2) of this section) to the test subsites within an unprotected test site using an accurately calibrated solar simulator. Select doses that are a geometric series represented by 1.25<SU>n</SU> (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> each dose is 25 percent greater than the previous dose).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">UV exposure for final</E> MED<E T="52">u</E>, ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, <E T="03">and</E> tpMED<E T="52">p</E>. For each subject, determine the final MED<E T="52">u</E>, ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, and tpMED<E T="52">p</E> by administering a series of five UV doses to the appropriate test sites. The middle dose (X) in each of these dose series (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the third dose) should equal the initial MED<E T="52">u</E> times the expected SPF. Note that the expected SPF equals 1 and 16.3 for the final MED<E T="52">u</E> and ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, respectively. The remaining UV doses in the series depend upon the expected SPF value of the sunscreen test product(s).</P>

              <P>For products with an expected SPF less than 8, administer UV doses that increase by 25 percent with each successive dose (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 0.64X, 0.80X, 1.00X, 1.25X, and 1.56X). For products with an expected SPF from 8 to 15, administer UV doses that increase by 20 percent with each successive dose (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 0.69X, 0.83X, 1.00X, 1.20X, and 1.44X). For products with an expected SPF higher than 15, administer UV doses that increase by 15 percent with each successive dose (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 0.76X, 0.87X, 1.00X, 1.15X, and 1.32X).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Evaluation of test subsites.</E> In order that the person who evaluates the test subsites is not biased, he/she should not be the same person who applied the sunscreen drug product to the test site or administered the UV doses. After UV doses are administered, all immediate responses should be recorded. These may include an immediate darkening or tanning, typically grayish or purplish in color, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes; an immediate reddening at the subsite, due to heating of the skin, which fades rapidly; and an immediate generalized heat response, spreading beyond the subsite, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes. After the immediate responses are noted, each subject should shield the exposed area from further UV radiation until the MED is determined. Determine the MED 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. Because erythema is evaluated 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure, the final MED<E T="52">u</E>, ssMED<E T="52">p</E>, and tpMED<E T="52">p</E> are typically determined the day following determination of the initial MED<E T="52">u</E>. Evaluate the erythema responses of each test subsite using either tungsten or warm white fluorescent lighting that provides at least 450 lux of illumination at the test site. For the evaluation, the test subject should be in the same position as when the test site was irradiated.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Invalid test data.</E> Reject test data for a test subject if erythema is not present on either the unprotected or protected test sites; or erythema is present at all subsites; or the responses are inconsistent with the series of UV doses administered; or the subject was noncompliant (e.g., the subject withdraws from the test due to illness or work conflicts or does not shield the exposed testing sites from further UV radiation until the MED is determined).</P>

              <P>(7) <E T="03">Determination of water resistance.</E> The following procedure should be performed in an indoor fresh water pool, whirlpool, and/or hot tub maintained at 23 to 32 °C.

              <P>(j) <E T="03">Broad spectrum test procedure</E>—(1) <E T="03">UV Spectrometry.</E> (i) <E T="03">Plate.</E> Use optical-grade polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates suitable for UV transmittance measurements. The plate should be roughened on one side to a three dimensional surface topography measure (Sa) between 2 and 7 micrometers and must have a rectangular application area of at least 16 square centimeters (with no side shorter than 4 cm).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sample holder.</E> The sample holder should hold the PMMA plate in a horizontal position to avoid flowing of the sunscreen drug product from one edge of the PMMA plate to the other. It should be mounted as close as possible to the input optics of the spectrometer to maximize capture of forward scattered radiation. The sample holder should be a thin, flat plate with a suitable aperture through which UV radiation can pass. The PMMA plate should be placed on the upper surface of the sample holder with the roughened side facing up.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Light source.</E> The light source should produce a continuous spectral distribution of UV radiation from 290 to 400 nanometers.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Input optics.</E> Unless the spectrometer is equipped with an integrating sphere, an ultraviolet radiation diffuser should be placed between the sample and the input optics of the spectrometer. The diffuser will be constructed from any UV radiation transparent material (e.g., Teflon ® or quartz). The diffuser ensures that the radiation received by the spectrometer is not collimated. The spectrometer input slits should be set to provide a bandwidth that is less than or equal to 1 nanometer.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Dynamic range of the spectrometer.</E> The dynamic range of the spectrometer should be sufficient to measure transmittance accurately through a highly absorbing sunscreen product at all terrestrial solar UV wavelengths (290 to 400 nm).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sunscreen product application to PMMA plate.</E> The accuracy of the test depends upon the application of a precisely controlled amount of sunscreen <PRTPAGE P="104"/>product with a uniform distribution over the PMMA plate. The product is applied at 0.75 mg per square centimeter to the roughened side of the PMMA plate. The sunscreen product should be applied in a series of small dots over the entire PMMA plate and then spread evenly using a gloved finger. Spreading should be done with a very light spreading action for approximately 30 seconds followed by spreading with greater pressure for approximately 30 seconds. The plate should then be allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes in the dark before the pre-irradiation described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Sunscreen product pre-irradiation.</E> To account for lack of photostability, apply the sunscreen product to the PMMA plate as described in paragraph (b) of this section and then irradiate with a solar simulator described in section 352.70(b) of this chapter. The irradiation dose should be 4 MEDs which is equivalent to an erythemal effective dose of 800 J/m<SU>2</SU> (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 800 J/m<SU>2</SU>-eff).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Calculation of mean transmittance values.</E> After pre-irradiation described in paragraph (c) of this section, mean transmittance values should be determined for each wavelength λ over the full UV spectrum (290 to 400 nanometers). The transmittance values should be measured at 1 nanometer intervals. Measurements of spectral irradiance transmitted for each wavelength λ through control PMMA plates coated with 15 microliters of glycerin (no sunscreen product) should be obtained from at least 5 different locations on the PMMA plate [C1(λ), C2(λ), C3(λ), C4(λ), and C5(λ)]. In addition, a minimum of 5 measurements of spectral irradiance transmitted for each wavelength λ through the PMMA plate covered with the sunscreen product will be similarly obtained after pre-irradiation of the sunscreen product [P1(λ), P2(λ), P3(λ), P4(λ), and P5(λ)].</P>

              <SUBJECT>Labeling of medical gas containers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Portable cryogenic medical gas containers.</E> For the purposes of this section a “portable cryogenic medical gas container” is one that is capable of being transported and is intended to be attached to a medical gas supply system within a hospital, health care entity, nursing home, other facility, or home health care setting, or is a base unit used to fill small cryogenic gas containers for use by individual patients. The term does not include cryogenic containers that are not designed to be connected to a medical gas supply system, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> tank trucks, trailers, rail cars, or small cryogenic gas containers for use by individual patients (including portable liquid oxygen units as defined at § 868.5655 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(1) Each portable cryogenic medical gas container must be conspicuously marked with a 360° wraparound label identifying its contents. Such label must meet the requirements of § 211.94(e)(2) of this chapter and the following additional requirements.</P>
              <P>(i) If the container holds a single gas, the name of the gas held in the container must be printed on the label in one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(A) Using lettering that appears in the color designated for the gas in paragraph (c) of this section and that is printed against a white background, or</P>
              <P>(B) Using lettering that appears in white against a background that is painted in the color for the gas designated in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The lettering for the name of the gas on the label must be at least 2 inches high.</P>
              <P>(iii) The name of the gas must be printed continuously around the label and be capable of being read around the entire container.</P>
              <P>(iv) The label must be on the sidewall of the container, as close to the top of the container as possible but below the top weld seam.</P>
              <P>(v) A portable cryogenic medical gas container may only be colored in the color or colors designated in paragraph (c) of this section if the gas or gases held within the container correspond to that color or those colors.</P>
              <P>(2) A label on the container (either the 360° wraparound label required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a separate label) must include, in conspicuous lettering, the phrase “For Medical Use”, “Medical Gas,” or some similar phrase that indicates the gas is for medical use.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">High-pressure medical gas cylinders.</E> Each high-pressure medical gas cylinder must be colored on the shoulder portion of the cylinder in the color or colors designated in paragraph (c) of this section. The color or colors must be visible when viewed from the top of cylinder.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Medical gas colors.</E> The colors required to identify medical gases under paragraph (a) and (b) of this section are:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Prescription-drug advertisements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a)(1) The ingredient information required by section 502(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shall appear together, without any intervening <PRTPAGE P="108"/>written, printed, or graphic matter, except the proprietary names of ingredients, which may be included with the listing of established names.</P>
            <P>(2) The order of listing of ingredients in the advertisement shall be the same as the order of listing of ingredients on the label of the product, and the information presented in the advertisement concerning the quantity of each such ingredient shall be the same as the corresponding information on the label of the product.</P>
            <P>(3) The advertisement shall not employ a fanciful proprietary name for the drug or any ingredient in such a manner as to imply that the drug or ingredient has some unique effectiveness or composition, when, in fact, the drug or ingredient is a common substance, the limitations of which are readily recognized when the drug or ingredient is listed by its established name.</P>
            <P>(4) The advertisement shall not feature inert or inactive ingredients in a manner that creates an impression of value greater than their true functional role in the formulation.</P>
            <P>(5) The advertisement shall not designate a drug or ingredient by a proprietary name that, because of similarity in spelling or pronunciation, may be confused with the proprietary name or the established name of a different drug or ingredient.</P>

            <P>(b)(1) If an advertisement for a prescription drug bears a proprietary name or designation for the drug or any ingredient thereof, the established name, if such there be, corresponding to such proprietary name or designation shall accompany such proprietary name or designation each time it is featured in the advertisement for the drug; but, except as provided below in this subparagraph, the established name need not be used with the proprietary name or designation in the running text of the advertisement. On any page of an advertisement in which the proprietary name or designation is not featured but is used in the running text, the established name shall be used at least once in the running text in association with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in the running text: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the proprietary name or designation is used in the running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name or designation in such running text. If any advertisement includes a column with running text containing detailed information as to composition, prescribing, side effects, or contraindications and the proprietary name or designation is used in such column but is not featured above or below the column, the established name shall be used at least once in such column of running text in association with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in such column of running text: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the proprietary name or designation is used in such column of running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name or designation in such column of running text. Where the established name is required to accompany or to be used in association with the proprietary name or designation, the established name shall be placed in direct conjunction with the proprietary name or designation, and the relationship between the proprietary name or designation and the established name shall be made clear by use of a phrase such as “brand of” preceding the established name, by brackets surrounding the established name, or by other suitable means.</P>
            <P>(2) The established name shall be printed in letters that are at least half as large as the letters comprising the proprietary name or designation with which it is joined, and the established name shall have a prominence commensurate with the prominence with which such proprietary name or designation appears, taking into account all pertinent factors, including typography, layout, contrast, and other printing features.</P>

            <P>(c) In the case of a prescription drug containing two or more active ingredients, if the advertisement bears a proprietary name or designation for such mixture and there is no established <PRTPAGE P="109"/>name corresponding to such proprietary name or designation, the quantitative ingredient information required in the advertisement by section 502(n) of the act shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of the proprietary name or designation. The prominence of the quantitative ingredient information shall bear a reasonable relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) If the advertisement employs one proprietary name or designation to refer to a combination of active ingredients present in more than one preparation (the individual preparations differing from each other as to quantities of active ingredients and/or the form of the finished preparation) and there is no established name corresponding to such proprietary name or designation, a listing showing the established names of the active ingredients shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of such proprietary name or designation. The prominence of this listing of active ingredients shall bear a reasonable relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name and the relationship between such proprietary name or designation, and the listing of active ingredients shall be made clear by use of such phrase as “brand of”, preceding the listing of active ingredients.</P>
            <P>(2) The advertisement shall prominently display the name of at least one specific dosage form and shall have the quantitative ingredient information required by section 502(n) of the act in direct conjunction with such display. If other dosage forms are listed in the advertisement, the quantitative ingredient information for such dosage forms shall appear in direct conjunction and in equal prominence with the most prominent listing of the names of such dosage forms.</P>
            <P>(e) True statement of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">When required.</E> All advertisements for any prescription drug (“prescription drug” as used in this section means drugs defined in section 503(b)(1) of the act and § 201.105, applicable to drugs for use by man and veterinary drugs, respectively), except advertisements described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, shall present a true statement of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications (when used in this section “side effects, contraindications” include side effects, warnings, precautions, and contraindications and include any such information under such headings as cautions, special considerations, important notes, etc.) and effectiveness. Advertisements broadcast through media such as radio, television, or telephone communications systems shall include information relating to the major side effects and contraindications of the advertised drugs in the audio or audio and visual parts of the presentation and unless adequate provision is made for dissemination of the approved or permitted package labeling in connection with the broadcast presentation shall contain a brief summary of all necessary information related to side effects and contraindications.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exempt advertisements.</E> The following advertisements are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section under the conditions specified:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Reminder advertisements.</E> Reminder advertisements are those which call attention to the name of the drug product but do not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug product. These reminder advertisements shall contain only the proprietary name of the drug product, if any; the established name of the drug product, if any; the established name of each active ingredient in the drug product; and, optionally, information relating to quantitative ingredient statements, dosage form, quantity of package contents, price, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor or other written, printed, or graphic matter containing no representation or suggestion relating to the advertised drug product. If the Commissioner finds that there is evidence of significant incidence of fatalities or serious injury associated with the use of a particular prescription drug, he may withdraw this exemption by so notifying the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug by letter. Reminder advertisements, other than those solely intended to convey <PRTPAGE P="110"/>price information including, but not limited to, those subject to the requirements of § 200.200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a prescription drug product whose labeling contains a boxed warning relating to a serious hazard associated with the use of the drug product. Reminder advertisements which are intended to provide consumers with information concerning the price charged for a prescription for a drug product are exempt from the requirements of this section if they meet all of the conditions contained in § 200.200 of this chapter. Reminder advertisements, other than those subject to the requirements of § 200.200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a drug for which an announcement has been published pursuant to a review on the labeling claims for the drug by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, and for which no claim has been evaluated as higher than “possibly effective.” If the Commissioner finds the circumstances are such that a reminder advertisement may be misleading to prescribers of drugs subject to NAS/NRC evaluation, such advertisements will not be allowed and the manufacturer, packer, or distributor will be notified either in the publication of the conclusions on the effectiveness of the drug or by letter.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs.</E> Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs that promote sale of the drug in bulk packages in accordance with the practice of the trade solely to be processed, manufactured, labeled, or repackaged in substantial quantities and that contain no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Advertisements of prescription-compounding drugs.</E> Advertisements of prescription-compounding drugs that promote sale of a drug for use as a prescription chemical or other compound for use by registered pharmacists in compounding prescriptions if the drug otherwise complies with the conditions for the labeling exemption contained in § 201.120 and the advertisement contains no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Scope of information to be included; applicability to the entire advertisement.</E> (i) The requirement of a true statement of information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness applies to the entire advertisement. Untrue or misleading information in any part of the advertisement will not be corrected by the inclusion in another distinct part of the advertisement of a brief statement containing true information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness of the drug. If any part or theme of the advertisement would make the advertisement false or misleading by reason of the omission of appropriate qualification or pertinent information, that part or theme shall include the appropriate qualification or pertinent information, which may be concise if it is supplemented by a prominent reference on each page to the presence and location elsewhere in the advertisement of a more complete discussion of such qualification or information.</P>
            <P>(ii) The information relating to effectiveness is not required to include information relating to all purposes for which the drug is intended but may optionally be limited to a true statement of the effectiveness of the drug for the selected purpose(s) for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement. The information relating to effectiveness shall include specific indications for use of the drug for purposes claimed in the advertisement; for example, when an advertisement contains a broad claim that a drug is an antibacterial agent, the advertisement shall name a type or types of infections and microorganisms for which the drug is effective clinically as specifically as required, approved, or permitted in the drug package labeling.</P>

            <P>(iii) The information relating to side effects and contraindications shall disclose each specific side effect and contraindication (which include side effects, warnings, precautions, and contraindications and include any such information under such headings as cautions, special considerations, important notes, etc.; see paragraph (e)(1) of this section) contained in required, approved, or permitted labeling for the advertised drug dosage form(s): <E T="03">Provided, however,</E>
            </P>
            <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The side effects and contraindications disclosed may be limited to those <PRTPAGE P="111"/>pertinent to the indications for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement to the extent that such limited disclosure has previously been approved or permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of §§ 201.100 or 201.105; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The use of a single term for a group of side effects and contraindications (for example, “blood dyscrasias” for disclosure of “leukopenia,” “agranulocytosis,” and “neutropenia”) is permitted only to the extent that the use of such a single term in place of disclosure of each specific side effect and contraindication has been previously approved or permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of §§ 201.100 or 201.105.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Substance of information to be included in brief summary.</E> (i)(<E T="03">a</E>) An advertisement for a prescription drug covered by a new-drug application approved pursuant to section 505 of the act after October 10, 1962, or a prescription drug covered by a new animal drug application approved pursuant to section 512 of the act after August 1, 1969, or any approved supplement thereto, or for a prescription drug listed in the index pursuant to section 572 of the act, or any granted modification thereto, shall not recommend or suggest any use that is not in the labeling accepted in such approved new-drug application or supplement, new animal drug application or supplement, or new animal drug index listing or modification. The advertisement shall present information from labeling required, approved, permitted, or granted in a new-drug or new animal drug application or new animal drug index listing relating to each specific side effect and contraindication in such labeling that relates to the uses of the advertised drug dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) If a prescription drug was covered by a new-drug application or a supplement thereto that became effective prior to October 10, 1962, an advertisement may recommend or suggest:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Uses contained in the labeling accepted in such new-drug application and any effective, approved, or permitted supplement thereto.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Additional uses contained in labeling in commercial use on October 9, 1962, to the extent that such uses did not cause the drug to be an unapproved “new drug” as “new drug” was defined in section 201(p) of the act as then in force, and to the extent that such uses would be permitted were the drug subject to paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Additional uses contained in labeling in current commercial use to the extent that such uses do not cause the drug to be an unapproved “new drug” as defined in section 201(p) of the act as amended or a “new animal drug” as defined in section 201(v) of the act as amended.</P>
            <FP>The advertisement shall present information from labeling required, approved, or permitted in a new-drug application relating to each specific side effect and contraindication in such labeling that relates to the uses of the advertised drug dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.</FP>
            <P>(ii) In the case of an advertisement for a prescription drug other than a drug the labeling of which causes it to be an unapproved “new drug” and other than drugs covered by paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, an advertisement may recommend and suggest the drug only for those uses contained in the labeling thereof:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) For which the drug is generally recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of such drugs; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) For which there exists substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness, consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations (as used in this section “clinical investigations,” “clinical experience,” and “clinical significance” mean in the case of drugs intended for administration to man, investigations, experience, or significance in humans, and in the case of drugs intended for administration to other animals, investigations, experience, or significance in the specie or species for which the drug is advertised), by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the <PRTPAGE P="112"/>safety and effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug is safe and effective for such uses; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) For which there exists substantial clinical experience (as used in this section this means substantial clinical experience adequately documented in medical literature or by other data (to be supplied to the Food and Drug Administration, if requested)), on the basis of which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that the drug is safe and effective for such uses; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) For which safety is supported under any of the preceding clauses in paragraphs (e)(4)(iii) (<E T="03">a</E>), (<E T="03">b</E>), and (<E T="03">c</E>) of this section and effectiveness is supported under any other of such clauses.</P>
            <FP>The advertisement shall present information relating to each specific side effect and contraindication that is required, approved, or permitted in the package labeling by §§ 201.100 or 201.105 of this chapter of the drug dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.</FP>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">“True statement” of information.</E> An advertisement does not satisfy the requirement that it present a “true statement” of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness if:</P>
            <P>(i) It is false or misleading with respect to side effects, contraindications, or effectiveness; or</P>

            <P>(ii) It fails to present a fair balance between information relating to side effects and contraindications and information relating to effectiveness of the drug in that the information relating to effectiveness is presented in greater scope, depth, or detail than is required by section 502(n) of the act and this information is not fairly balanced by a presentation of a summary of true information relating to side effects and contraindications of the drug; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That no advertisement shall be considered to be in violation of this section if the presentation of true information relating to side effects and contraindications is comparable in depth and detail with the claims for effectiveness or safety.</P>
            <P>(iii) It fails to reveal facts material in the light of its representations or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the advertisement.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Advertisements that are false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.</E> An advertisement for a prescription drug is false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act, among other reasons, if it:</P>

            <P>(i) Contains a representation or suggestion, not approved or permitted for use in the labeling, that a drug is better, more effective, useful in a broader range of conditions or patients (as used in this section <E T="03">patients</E> means humans and in the case of veterinary drugs, other animals), safer, has fewer, or less incidence of, or less serious side effects or contraindications than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience (as described in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) (<E T="03">b</E>) and (<E T="03">c</E>) of this section) whether or not such representations are made by comparison with other drugs or treatments, and whether or not such a representation or suggestion is made directly or through use of published or unpublished literature, quotations, or other references.</P>
            <P>(ii) Contains a drug comparison that represents or suggests that a drug is safer or more effective than another drug in some particular when it has not been demonstrated to be safer or more effective in such particular by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.</P>
            <P>(iii) Contains favorable information or opinions about a drug previously regarded as valid but which have been rendered invalid by contrary and more credible recent information, or contains literature references or quotations that are significantly more favorable to the drug than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.</P>

            <P>(iv) Contains a representation or suggestion that a drug is safer than it has been demonstrated to be by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience, by selective presentation of information from published articles or other references that report no side effects or <PRTPAGE P="113"/>minimal side effects with the drug or otherwise selects information from any source in a way that makes a drug appear to be safer than has been demonstrated.</P>
            <P>(v) Presents information from a study in a way that implies that the study represents larger or more general experience with the drug than it actually does.</P>
            <P>(vi) Contains references to literature or studies that misrepresent the effectiveness of a drug by failure to disclose that claimed results may be due to concomitant therapy, or by failure to disclose the credible information available concerning the extent to which claimed results may be due to placebo effect (information concerning placebo effect is not required unless the advertisement promotes the drug for use by man).</P>
            <P>(vii) Contains favorable data or conclusions from nonclinical studies of a drug, such as in laboratory animals or in vitro, in a way that suggests they have clinical significance when in fact no such clinical significance has been demonstrated.</P>
            <P>(viii) Uses a statement by a recognized authority that is apparently favorable about a drug but fails to refer to concurrent or more recent unfavorable data or statements from the same authority on the same subject or subjects.</P>
            <P>(ix) Uses a quote or paraphrase out of context to convey a false or misleading idea.</P>
            <P>(x) Uses literature, quotations, or references that purport to support an advertising claim but in fact do not support the claim or have relevance to the claim.</P>
            <P>(xi) Uses literature, quotations, or references for the purpose of recommending or suggesting conditions of drug use that are not approved or permitted in the drug package labeling.</P>
            <P>(xii) Offers a combination of drugs for the treatment of patients suffering from a condition amenable to treatment by any of the components rather than limiting the indications for use to patients for whom concomitant therapy as provided by the fixed combination drug is indicated, unless such condition is included in the uses permitted under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(xiii) Uses a study on normal individuals without disclosing that the subjects were normal, unless the drug is intended for use on normal individuals.</P>
            <P>(xiv) Uses “statistics” on numbers of patients, or counts of favorable results or side effects, derived from pooling data from various insignificant or dissimilar studies in a way that suggests either that such “statistics” are valid if they are not or that they are derived from large or significant studies supporting favorable conclusions when such is not the case.</P>
            <P>(xv) Uses erroneously a statistical finding of “no significant difference” to claim clinical equivalence or to deny or conceal the potential existence of a real clinical difference.</P>
            <P>(xvi) Uses statements or representations that a drug differs from or does not contain a named drug or category of drugs, or that it has a greater potency per unit of weight, in a way that suggests falsely or misleadingly or without substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience that the advertised drug is safer or more effective than such other drug or drugs.</P>
            <P>(xvii) Uses data favorable to a drug derived from patients treated with dosages different from those recommended in approved or permitted labeling if the drug advertised is subject to section 505 of the act, or, in the case of other drugs, if the dosages employed were different from those recommended in the labeling and generally recognized as safe and effective. This provision is not intended to prevent citation of reports of studies that include some patients treated with dosages different from those authorized, if the results in such patients are not used.</P>
            <P>(xviii) Uses headline, subheadline, or pictorial or other graphic matter in a way that is misleading.</P>
            <P>(xix) Represents or suggests that drug dosages properly recommended for use in the treatment of certain classes of patients or disease conditions are safe and effective for the treatment of other classes of patients or disease conditions when such is not the case.</P>

            <P>(xx) Presents required information relating to side effects or contraindications by means of a general term for a group in place of disclosing each specific side effect and contraindication <PRTPAGE P="114"/>(for example employs the term <E T="03">blood dyscrasias</E> instead of “leukopenia,” “agranulocytosis,” “neutropenia,” etc.) unless the use of such general term conforms to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That any provision of this paragraph shall be waived with respect to a specified advertisement as set forth in a written communication from the Food and Drug Administration on a petition for such a waiver from a person who would be adversely affected by the enforcement of such provision on the basis of a showing that the advertisement is not false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act. A petition for such a waiver shall set forth clearly and concisely the petitioner's interest in the advertisement, the specific provision of this paragraph from which a waiver is sought, a complete copy of the advertisement, and a showing that the advertisement is not false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act.</FP>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Advertisements that may be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.</E> An advertisement may be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act if it:</P>
            <P>(i) Contains favorable information or conclusions from a study that is inadequate in design, scope, or conduct to furnish significant support for such information or conclusions.</P>
            <P>(ii) Uses the concept of “statistical significance” to support a claim that has not been demonstrated to have clinical significance or validity, or fails to reveal the range of variations around the quoted average results.</P>
            <P>(iii) Uses statistical analyses and techniques on a retrospective basis to discover and cite findings not soundly supported by the study, or to suggest scientific validity and rigor for data from studies the design or protocol of which are not amenable to formal statistical evaluations.</P>
            <P>(iv) Uses tables or graphs to distort or misrepresent the relationships, trends, differences, or changes among the variables or products studied; for example, by failing to label abscissa and ordinate so that the graph creates a misleading impression.</P>
            <P>(v) Uses reports or statements represented to be statistical analyses, interpretations, or evaluations that are inconsistent with or violate the established principles of statistical theory, methodology, applied practice, and inference, or that are derived from clinical studies the design, data, or conduct of which substantially invalidate the application of statistical analyses, interpretations, or evaluations.</P>
            <P>(vi) Contains claims concerning the mechanism or site of drug action that are not generally regarded as established by scientific evidence by experts qualified by scientific training and experience without disclosing that the claims are not established and the limitations of the supporting evidence.</P>
            <P>(vii) Fails to provide sufficient emphasis for the information relating to side effects and contraindications, when such information is contained in a distinct part of an advertisement, because of repetition or other emphasis in that part of the advertisement of claims for effectiveness or safety of the drug.</P>
            <P>(viii) Fails to present information relating to side effects and contraindications with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to effectiveness of the drug, taking into account all implementing factors such as typography, layout, contrast, headlines, paragraphing, white space, and any other techniques apt to achieve emphasis.</P>
            <P>(ix) Fails to provide adequate emphasis (for example, by the use of color scheme, borders, headlines, or copy that extends across the gutter) for the fact that two facing pages are part of the same advertisement when one page contains information relating to side effects and contraindications.</P>

            <P>(x) In an advertisement promoting use of the drug in a selected class of patients (for example, geriatric patients or depressed patients), fails to present with adequate emphasis the significant side effects and contraindications or the significant dosage considerations, when dosage recommendations are included in an advertisement, especially <PRTPAGE P="115"/>applicable to that selected class of patients.</P>
            <P>(xi) Fails to present on a page facing another page (or on another full page) of an advertisement on more than one page, information relating to side effects and contraindications when such information is in a distinct part of the advertisement.</P>
            <P>(xii) Fails to include on each page or spread of an advertisement the information relating to side effects and contraindications or a prominent reference to its presence and location when it is presented as a distinct part of an advertisement.</P>
            <P>(xiii) Contains information from published or unpublished reports or opinions falsely or misleadingly represented or suggested to be authentic or authoritative.</P>
            <P>(f)-(i) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(j)(1) No advertisement concerning a particular prescription drug may be disseminated without prior approval by the Food and Drug Administration if:</P>
            <P>(i) The sponsor or the Food and Drug Administration has received information that has not been widely publicized in medical literature that the use of the drug may cause fatalities or serious damage;</P>
            <P>(ii) The Commissioner (or in his absence the officer acting as Commissioner), after evaluating the reliability of such information, has notified the sponsor that the information must be a part of the advertisements for the drug; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The sponsor has failed within a reasonable time as specified in such notification to present to the Food and Drug Administration a program, adequate in light of the nature of the information, for assuring that such information will be publicized promptly and adequately to the medical profession in subsequent advertisements.</P>
            <FP>If the Commissioner finds that the program presented is not being followed, he will notify the sponsor that prior approval of all advertisements for the particular drug will be required. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as limiting the Commissioner's or the Secretary's rights, as authorized by law, to issue publicity, to suspend any new-drug application, to decertify any antibiotic, or to recommend any regulatory action.</FP>
            <P>(2) Within a reasonable time after information concerning the possibility that a drug may cause fatalities or serious damage has been widely publicized in medical literature, the Food and Drug Administration shall notify the sponsor of the drug by mail that prior approval of advertisements for the drug is no longer necessary.</P>
            <P>(3) Dissemination of an advertisement not in compliance with this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act that causes the drug to be misbranded under section 502(n) of the act.</P>
            <P>(4) Any advertisement may be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration prior to publication for comment. If the advertiser is notified that the submitted advertisement is not in violation and, at some subsequent time, the Food and Drug Administration changes its opinion, the advertiser will be so notified and will be given a reasonable time for correction before any regulatory action is taken under this section. Notification to the advertiser that a proposed advertisement is or is not considered to be in violation shall be in written form.</P>
            <P>(5) The sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter with respect to any determination that prior approval is required for advertisements concerning a particular prescription drug, or that a particular advertisement is not approvable.</P>
            <P>(k) An advertisement issued or caused to be issued by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug promoted by the advertisement and which is not in compliance with section 502(n) of the act and the applicable regulations thereunder shall cause stocks of such drug in possession of the person responsible for issuing or causing the issuance of the advertisement, and stocks of the drug distributed by such person and still in the channels of commerce, to be misbranded under section 502(n) of the act.</P>

            <P>(l)(1) Advertisements subject to section 502(n) of the act include advertisements in published journals, magazines, other periodicals, and newspapers, and advertisements broadcast <PRTPAGE P="116"/>through media such as radio, television, and telephone communication systems.</P>
            <P>(2) Brochures, booklets, mailing pieces, detailing pieces, file cards, bulletins, calendars, price lists, catalogs, house organs, letters, motion picture films, film strips, lantern slides, sound recordings, exhibits, literature, and reprints and similar pieces of printed, audio, or visual matter descriptive of a drug and references published (for example, the “Physicians Desk Reference”) for use by medical practitioners, pharmacists, or nurses, containing drug information supplied by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug and which are disseminated by or on behalf of its manufacturer, packer, or distributor are hereby determined to be labeling as defined in section 201(m) of the act.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Represents or suggests that a prescription drug is safer or more effective than another drug in some particular when the difference has not been demonstrated by substantial evidence. An advertisement for a prescription drug may not, either directly or by implication, e.g., by use of comparative test data or reference to published reports, represent that the drug is safer or more effective than another drug, nor may an advertisement contain a quantitative statement of safety or effectiveness (<E T="03">a</E>) unless the representation has been approved as part of the labeling in a new drug application or biologic license, or (<E T="03">b</E>) if the drug is not a new drug or biologic, unless the representation of safety or effectiveness is supported by substantial evidence derived from adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in § 314.111(a)(5)(ii) of this chapter, or unless the requirement for adequate and well-controlled studies is waived as provided in § 314.111(a)(5)(ii) of this chapter.<STARS/>

                    <P>(1) If no storage requirements are established for a prescription drug, the drug may be held at “controlled” room temperature, as defined in an official compendium, to help ensure that its identity, strength, quality, and purity are not adversely affected.</P>
                    <P>(2) Appropriate manual, electromechanical, or electronic temperature and humidity recording equipment, devices, and/or logs shall be utilized to document proper storage of prescription drugs.</P>

In determining whether the conditions under which a drug has been returned cast doubt on the drug's safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity, the wholesale drug distributor shall consider, among other things, the conditions under which the drug has been held, stored, or shipped before or during its return and the condition of the drug and its container, carton, or labeling, as a result of storage or shipping.</P>
                    <P>(4) The recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (f) of this section shall be followed for all outdated, damaged, deteriorated, misbranded, or adulterated prescription drugs.</P>

Records kept at a central location apart from the inspection site and not electronically retrievable shall be made available for inspection within 2 working days of a request by an authorized official of a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency.</P>
                    <P>(g) <E T="03">Written policies and procedures.</E> Wholesale drug distributors shall establish, maintain, and adhere to written policies and procedures, which shall be followed for the receipt, security, storage, inventory, and distribution of prescription drugs, including policies and procedures for identifying, recording, and reporting losses or thefts, and for correcting all errors and inaccuracies in inventories.

                    <P>(ii) Any voluntary action by the manufacturer to remove defective or potentially defective drugs from the market; or</P>
                    <P>(iii) Any action undertaken to promote public health and safety by replacing of existing merchandise with an improved product or new package design.</P>
                    <P>(3) A procedure to ensure that wholesale drug distributors prepare for, protect against, and handle any crisis that affects security or operation of any facility in the event of strike, fire, flood, or other natural disaster, or other situations of local, State, or national emergency.</P>
                    <P>(4) A procedure to ensure that any outdated prescription drugs shall be segregated from other drugs and either returned to the manufacturer or destroyed.

                    <P>(b) Exemption of drugs because of size or unique physical characteristics:</P>
                    <P>(1) For a drug subject to premarket approval, FDA may provide an exemption from the requirements of § 206.10 upon a showing that the product's size, shape, texture, or other physical characteristics make imprinting technologically infeasible or impossible.</P>

                    <P>(i) Exemption requests for products with approved applications shall be made in writing to the appropriate review division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Food and Drug Administration, 5901-B Ammendale Rd., Beltsville, MD 20705-1266 or the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation <PRTPAGE P="135"/>and Research, Document Control Center, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Rm.

                    <P>(a) Unless exempted under § 206.7, no drug product in solid oral dosage form may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is clearly marked or imprinted with a code imprint that, in conjunction with the product's size, shape, and color, permits the unique identification of the drug product and the manufacturer or distributor of the product. Identification of the drug product requires identification of its active ingredients and its dosage strength. Inclusion of a letter or number in the imprint, while not required, is encouraged as a more effective means of identification than a symbol or logo by itself. Homeopathic drug products are required only to bear an imprint that identifies the manufacturer and their homeopathic nature.</P>
                    <P>(b) A holder of an approved application who has, under § 314.70 (b) of this chapter, supplemented its application to provide for a new imprint is not required to bring its product into compliance with this section during the pendency of the agency's review. Once the review is complete, the drug product is subject to the requirements of the rule.</P>
                    <P>(c) A solid oral dosage form drug product that does not meet the requirement for imprinting in paragraph (a) of this section and is not exempt from the requirement may be considered adulterated and misbranded and may be an unapproved new drug.</P>
                    <P>(d) For purposes of this section, <E T="03">code imprint</E> means any single letter or number or any combination of letters and numbers, including, e.g., words, company name, and National Drug Code, or a mark, symbol, logo, or monogram, or a combination of letters, numbers, and marks or symbols, assigned by a drug firm to a specific drug product.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>What is the National Drug Code (NDC), how is it assigned, and what are its requirements?</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">What is the NDC for a drug and what products must have unique NDCs</E>? The NDC for a drug is a numeric code. Each finished drug product or unfinished drug subject to the listing requirements of this part must have a unique NDC to identify its labeler, product, and package size and type.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">What is the format of an NDC</E>? (1) Except as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the NDC must consist <PRTPAGE P="143"/>of 10 or 11 digits, divided into three segments as follows:</P>
                      <P>(i) The first segment of the NDC is the labeler code and consists of 4, 5, or 6 digits. The labeler code is assigned by FDA.</P>
                      <P>(ii) The second segment of the NDC is the product code and consists of 3 or 4 digits, as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(iii) The third segment of the NDC is the package code and consists of 1 or 2 digits as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. The package code identifies the package size and type of the drug and differentiates between different quantitative and qualitative attributes of the product packaging.</P>
                      <P>(2) The following combinations of labeler code, product code and package code character lengths are permissible:</P>
                      <P>(i) If a labeler code is either 5 or 6 digits in length, it may be combined with:</P>
                      <P>(A) A product code consisting of 4 digits and a package code consisting of 1 digit for a total NDC length of 10 or 11 digits (5-4-1 or 6-4-1), or</P>
                      <P>(B) A product code consisting of 3 digits and a package code consisting of 2 digits for a total NDC length of 10 or 11 digits (5-3-2 or 6-3-2).</P>
                      <P>(ii) If a labeler code is 4 digits in length, it may be combined only with a product code consisting of 4 digits and a package code consisting of 2 digits for a total NDC length of 10 digits (4-4-2).</P>
                      <P>(3) A registrant or private label distributor with a given labeler code must use only one Product-Package Code configuration (e.g., a 3-digit product code combined with a 2-digit package code or a 4-digit product code combined with a 1-digit package code). This single configuration must be used in all NDCs that include the given labeler code that are reserved in accordance with § 207.33(d)(3) or listed in accordance with § 207.49 or § 207.53.</P>
                      <P>(4) An alternatively formatted NDC that is approved for use by the relevant Center Director may be used for the following HCT/Ps if they are minimally manipulated: Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells derived from peripheral and cord blood, and lymphocytes collected from peripheral blood.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Who must obtain an NDC labeler code and how is the code assigned and updated</E>? (1) Each person who engages in manufacturing, repacking, relabeling, or private label distribution of a drug subject to listing under this part must apply for an NDC labeler code, by providing the following information:</P>
                      <P>(i) The name, physical address, email address, and other contact information FDA may request, of the person for whom the NDC labeler code is requested;</P>
                      <P>(ii) The type(s) of activities (e.g., manufacture or repacking) in which the person requesting the NDC labeler code engages with respect to human drugs; and</P>
                      <P>(iii) The type(s) of drug(s) (human, animal, or both, and prescription, nonprescription, or both) to which the NDC labeler code will be applied.</P>
                      <P>(2) Each person who is assigned an NDC labeler code must update the information submitted under paragraph (c)(1)of this section within 30 calendar days after any change to that information.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">How is an NDC proposed for assignment by FDA, when is an NDC assigned by FDA, and how can a proposed NDC be reserved</E>? (1) An NDC is proposed for assignment by FDA when it is submitted for the first time with listing information in accordance with § 207.49 or § 207.53, as applicable.</P>
                      <P>(i) Each manufacturer, repacker, or relabeler must propose for assignment by FDA an NDC that includes its own labeler code for each package size and type of drug that it manufactures, repacks, or relabels for commercial distribution.</P>
                      <P>(ii) In addition, if a drug is distributed under the trade name or label of a private label distributor, the manufacturer, repacker, or relabeler must also propose for assignment by FDA an NDC that includes the labeler code of the private label distributor under whose trade name or label the drug is distributed, for each package size and type so distributed.</P>

                      <P>(2) If a proposed NDC conforms to the requirements of this section and is not reserved for a different drug or was not previously assigned to a different drug, FDA will assign the NDC to a drug <PRTPAGE P="144"/>when it receives listing information required for that drug under § 207.49 or § 207.53.</P>
                      <P>(3) A manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor may voluntarily reserve a proposed NDC for a drug, before the drug is listed, by submitting the following information:</P>
                      <P>(i) A proposed NDC that conforms to the requirements of this section;</P>
                      <P>(ii) The established name of the active ingredient(s) and the strength of each active ingredient in the drug; and</P>
                      <P>(iii) In the case of a finished drug product, the dosage form, and route of administration.</P>
                      <P>(4) If the required information is submitted and the proposed NDC is properly formatted and not already assigned or reserved, FDA will reserve the proposed NDC for a period of 2 years from the date of submission. If the drug for which the proposed NDC is reserved is not listed in accordance with § 207.49 or § 207.53 during such 2-year period, the reservation of the proposed NDC will lapse. FDA may also cancel the reservation of a proposed NDC at any time on the request of the person whose labeler code is included in the proposed NDC.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">How must the information be submitted to us</E>? The information described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section must be submitted electronically unless FDA grants a waiver under § 207.65.</P>

                      <P>(a) Once an NDC has been assigned by FDA, the registrant must propose a new and unique NDC for a drug when there is a change, after the drug is initially marketed, to any of the information identified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. A new NDC must be proposed to FDA for assignment through an updated listing in accordance with § 207.57.</P>
                      <P>(b) The proposed new NDC must include a new product code when there is a change to any of the following information:</P>
                      <P>(1) The drug's established name or proprietary name, if any;</P>
                      <P>(2) Any active pharmaceutical ingredient or the strength of any active pharmaceutical ingredient;</P>
                      <P>(3) The dosage form;</P>
                      <P>(4) A change in the drug's status, between prescription and nonprescription, or for animal drugs, between prescription, nonprescription, or veterinary feed directive (VFD) status;</P>
                      <P>(5) A change in the drug's intended use between human and animal; or</P>
                      <P>(6) The drug's distinguishing characteristics such as size, shape, color, code imprint, flavor, and scoring (if any).</P>
                      <P>(c) When there is a change only to the package size or type, including the immediate unit-of-use container, if any, the proposed new NDC must include only a new package code and retain the existing product code unless all available package codes have already been combined with the existing product code in NDCs assigned by FDA.</P>

                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Official contact.</E> Registrants subject to the registration requirements of this part must designate an official contact for each establishment. The official contact is responsible for:</P>

                      <P>(1) Ensuring the accuracy of registration and listing information; and<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(2) Reviewing, disseminating, routing, and responding to all communications from FDA including emergency communications.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">United States agent.</E> Registrants of foreign establishments subject to this part must designate a single United States agent. The United States agent must reside or maintain a place of business in the United States and may not be a mailbox, answering machine or service, or other place where a person acting as the United States agent is not physically present. The United States agent is responsible for:</P>
                      <P>(1) Reviewing, disseminating, routing, and responding to all communications from FDA including emergency communications;</P>
                      <P>(2) Responding to questions concerning those drugs that are imported or offered for import to the United States;</P>
                      <P>(3) Assisting FDA in scheduling inspections; and</P>
                      <P>(4) If FDA is unable to contact a foreign registrant directly or expeditiously, FDA may provide the information and/or documents to the United States agent. FDA's providing information and/or documents to the United States agent is equivalent to providing the same information and/or documents to the foreign registrant.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>What legal status is conferred by registration and listing?</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Registration of an establishment or listing of a drug does not denote approval of the establishment, the drug, or other drugs of the establishment, nor does it mean that a product may be legally marketed. Any representation that creates an impression of official approval or that a drug is approved or is legally marketable because of registration or listing is misleading and constitutes misbranding.</P>
                      <P>(b) FDA's acceptance of registration and listing information, inclusion of a drug in our database of drugs, or assignment of an NDC does not denote approval of the establishment or the drug or any other drugs of the establishment, nor does it mean that the drug may be legally marketed. Any representation that creates the impression that a drug is approved or is legally marketable because it appears in our database of drugs, has been assigned or displays an NDC, or the establishment has been assigned an establishment registration number or Unique Facility Identifier is misleading and constitutes misbranding. Failure to comply with § 207.37 may also constitute misbranding.</P>
                      <P>(c) Neither registration nor listing constitutes a determination by FDA that a product is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Registration or listing may, however, be evidence that a facility intends to or does manufacture, repack, relabel, distribute, or salvage drugs or that a product is intended to be a drug.</P>

                      <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the following information will be available for public disclosure, upon request or at FDA's discretion:</P>
                      <P>(1) All establishment registration information, and</P>
                      <P>(2) After a drug is marketed, information obtained under § 207.33, § 207.49, § 207.53, § 207.54, or § 207.57.</P>
                      <P>(b) Unless such information is publicly available or FDA finds that confidentiality would be inconsistent with protection of the public health, FDA will not make publicly available:</P>
                      <P>(1) Any information submitted under § 207.55 as the basis upon which it has been determined that a particular drug is not subject to section 505 or 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act,</P>
                      <P>(2) The names of any inactive ingredients submitted under § 207.49(a)(4) for which the registrant makes a valid assertion of confidentiality under § 20.61 of this chapter or other provision of law, or</P>
                      <P>(3) Drug listing information obtained under § 207.33(d)(3), § 207.49(a)(9) and (12), § 207.53(b) and (c), or § 207.54(a) or (c).</P>

                      <P>(c) FDA may determine, in limited circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, that it would be consistent with the protection of the public health and <PRTPAGE P="151"/>the Freedom of Information Act to exempt from public disclosure specific information identified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Scope and purpose.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) This part sets forth requirements for patient labeling for human prescription drug products, including biological products, that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determines pose a serious and significant public health concern requiring distribution of FDA-approved patient information. It applies primarily to human prescription drug products used on an outpatient basis without direct supervision by a health professional. This part shall apply to new prescriptions and refill prescriptions.</P>
                      <P>(b) The purpose of patient labeling for human prescription drug products required under this part is to provide information when the FDA determines in writing that it is necessary to patients' safe and effective use of drug products.</P>
                      <P>(c) Patient labeling will be required if the FDA determines that one or more of the following circumstances exists:</P>
                      <P>(1) The drug product is one for which patient labeling could help prevent serious adverse effects.</P>
                      <P>(2) The drug product is one that has serious risk(s) (relative to benefits) of which patients should be made aware because information concerning the risk(s) could affect patients' decision to use, or to continue to use, the product.</P>
                      <P>(3) The drug product is important to health and patient adherence to directions for use is crucial to the drug's effectiveness.</P>

                      <P>(a) FDA on its own initiative, or in response to a written request from an applicant, may exempt or defer any Medication Guide content or format requirement, except those requirements in § 208.20 (a)(2) and (a)(6), on the basis that the requirement is inapplicable, unnecessary, or contrary to patients' best interests. Requests from applicants should be submitted to the director of the FDA division responsible for reviewing the marketing application for the drug product, or for a biological product, to the application division in the office with product responsibility.</P>
                      <P>(b) If the licensed practitioner who prescribes a drug product subject to this part determines that it is not in a particular patient's best interest to receive a Medication Guide because of significant concerns about the effect of a Medication Guide, the licensed practitioner may direct that the Medication Guide not be provided to the particular patient. However, the authorized dispenser of a prescription drug product subject to this part shall provide a Medication Guide to any patient who requests information when the drug product is dispensed regardless of any such direction by the licensed practitioner.</P>

                      <P>(a) The regulations in this part contain the minimum current good manufacturing practice for preparation of drug products (excluding positron emission tomography drugs) for administration to humans or animals.</P>
                      <P>(b) The current good manufacturing practice regulations in this chapter as they pertain to drug products; in parts 600 through 680 of this chapter, as they pertain to drugs that are also biological products for human use; and in part 1271 of this chapter, as they are applicable to drugs that are also human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) and that are drugs (subject to review under an application submitted under section 505 of the act or under a biological product license application under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act); supplement and do not supersede the regulations in this part unless the regulations explicitly provide otherwise. In the event of a conflict between applicable regulations in this part and in other parts of this chapter, or in parts 600 through 680 of this chapter, or in part 1271 of this chapter, the regulation specifically applicable to the drug product in question shall supersede the more general.</P>

                      <P>(c) Pending consideration of a proposed exemption, published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of September 29, 1978, the requirements in this part shall not be enforced for OTC drug products if the products and all their ingredients are ordinarily marketed and consumed as human foods, and which products may also fall within the legal definition of drugs by virtue of their intended use. Therefore, until further notice, regulations under parts 110 and 117 of this chapter, and where applicable, parts 113 through 129 of this chapter, shall be applied in determining whether these OTC drug products that are also foods are manufactured, processed, packed, or held under current good manufacturing practice.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Tamper-evident packaging requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Food and Drug Administration has the authority under <PRTPAGE P="170"/>the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to establish a uniform national requirement for tamper-evident packaging of OTC drug products that will improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products. An OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant package or that is not properly labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of the act, or both.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for tamper-evident package.</E> (1) Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this product is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident package is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. To reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term “distinctive by design” means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to provide a visual indication of package integrity. The tamper-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and retail display.</P>
                      <P>(2) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any two-piece, hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an acceptable tamper-evident technology.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Labeling.</E> (1) In order to alert consumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules, containers of compressed medical oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is required to bear a statement that:</P>
                      <P>(i) Identifies all tamper-evident feature(s) and any capsule sealing technologies used to comply with paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Is prominently placed on the package; and</P>
                      <P>(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing.</P>
                      <P>(2) If the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section uses an identifying characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For example, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say “For your protection, this bottle has an imprinted seal around the neck.”</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Request for exemptions from packaging and labeling requirements.</E> A manufacturer or packer may request an exemption from the packaging and labeling requirements of this section. A request for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under § 10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a “Request for Exemption from the Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.” The petition is required to contain the following:</P>
                      <P>(1) The name of the drug product or, if the petition seeks an exemption for a drug class, the name of the drug class, and a list of products within that class.</P>
                      <P>(2) The reasons that the drug product's compliance with the tamper-evident packaging or labeling requirements of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved.</P>

                      <P>(3) A description of alternative steps that are available, or that the petitioner has already taken, to reduce the likelihood that the product or drug <PRTPAGE P="171"/>class will be the subject of malicious adulteration.</P>
                      <P>(4) Other information justifying an exemption.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">OTC drug products subject to approved new drug applications.</E> Holders of approved new drug applications for OTC drug products are required under § 314.70 of this chapter to provide the agency with notification of changes in packaging and labeling to comply with the requirements of this section. Changes in packaging and labeling required by this regulation may be made before FDA approval, as provided under § 314.70(c) of this chapter. Manufacturing changes by which capsules are to be sealed require prior FDA approval under § 314.70(b) of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(f) <E T="03">Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.</E> This section does not affect any requirements for “special packaging” as defined under § 310.3(l) of this chapter and required under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.</P>

                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Written specifications.</E> You must establish appropriate written specifications for the identity, quality, and purity of components and for the identity and quality of drug product containers and closures.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Examination and testing.</E> Upon receipt, each lot of components and containers and closures must be uniquely identified and tested or examined to determine whether the lot complies with your specifications. You must not use in PET drug production any lot that does not meet its specifications, including any expiration date if applicable, or that has not yet received its material release. Any incoming lot must be appropriately designated as quarantined, accepted, or rejected. You must use a reliable supplier as a source of each lot of each component, container, and closure.</P>
                      <P>(1)(i) If you conduct finished-product testing of a PET drug product that includes testing to ensure that the correct components have been used, you must determine that each lot of incoming components used in that PET drug product complies with written specifications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier. You are not required to perform a specific identity test on any of those components.</P>

                      <P>(ii) If you do not conduct finished-product testing of a PET drug product that ensures that the correct components have been used, you must conduct identity testing on each lot of a component that yields an active ingredient and each lot of an inactive ingredient used in that PET drug product. This testing must be conducted using tests that are specific to each component that yields an active ingredient and each inactive ingredient. For any other component, such as a solvent or reagent, that is not the subject of finished-product testing, you must determine that each lot complies with written specifications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier; if you use such a component to <PRTPAGE P="184"/>prepare an inactive ingredient on site, you must perform an identity test on the components used to make the inactive ingredient before the components are released for use. However, if you use as an inactive ingredient a product that is approved under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) and is marketed as a finished drug product intended for intravenous administration, you need not perform a specific identity test on that ingredient.</P>
                      <P>(2) You must examine a representative sample of each lot of containers and closures for conformity to its written specifications. You must perform at least a visual identification of each lot of containers and closures.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Handling and storage.</E> You must handle and store components, containers, and closures in a manner that prevents contamination, mix-ups, and deterioration and ensures that they are and remain suitable for their intended use.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Records.</E> You must keep a record for each shipment of each lot of components, containers, and closures that you receive. The record must include the identity and quantity of each shipment, the supplier's name and lot number, the date of receipt, the results of any testing performed, the disposition of rejected material, and the expiration date (where applicable).</P>

                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Specifications.</E> You must establish specifications for each PET drug product, including criteria for determining identity, strength, quality, purity, and, if appropriate, sterility and pyrogens.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Test procedures.</E> Before you implement a new test procedure in a specification, you must establish and document the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the procedure. If you use an established compendial test procedure in a specification, you must first verify and document that the test works under the conditions of actual use.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Conformance to specifications.</E> Before final release, you must conduct an appropriate laboratory determination to ensure that each batch of a PET drug product conforms to specifications, except for sterility. For a PET drug product produced in sub-batches, before final release, you must conduct an appropriate laboratory determination to ensure that each sub-batch conforms to specifications, except for sterility.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Final release procedures.</E> Except as conditional final release is permitted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, you must establish and follow procedures to ensure that each batch of a PET drug product is not given final release until the following are done:</P>
                      <P>(1) An appropriate laboratory determination under paragraph (c) of this section is completed;</P>
                      <P>(2) Associated laboratory data and documentation are reviewed and they demonstrate that the PET drug product meets specifications, except for sterility; and</P>
                      <P>(3) A designated qualified individual authorizes final release by dated signature.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Sterility testing.</E> Sterility testing need not be completed before final release but must be started within 30 hours after completion of production. The 30-hour requirement may be exceeded due to a weekend or holiday. If the sample for sterility testing is held longer than 30 hours, you must demonstrate that the longer period does not adversely affect the sample and the test results obtained will be equivalent to test results that would have been obtained if the test had been started within the 30-hour time period. Tested samples must be from individual batches and not pooled. If the product fails to meet a criterion for sterility, you must immediately notify all facilities that received the product of the test results and provide any appropriate recommendations. The notification must be documented. Upon completion of an investigation into the failure to meet a criterion for sterility, you must notify all facilities that received the product of the findings from the investigation.</P>

                      <P>(i) You have data documenting that preceding consecutive batches, produced using the same methods used for the conditionally released batch, demonstrate that the conditionally released batch will likely meet the established specifications;</P>
                      <P>(ii) You determine that all other acceptance criteria are met;</P>
                      <P>(iii) You retain a reserve sample of the conditionally released batch of drug product;</P>
                      <P>(iv) You promptly correct the malfunction of analytical equipment, complete the omitted test using the reserve sample after the malfunction is corrected, and document that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent recurrence of the malfunction;</P>
                      <P>(v) If you obtain an out-of-specification result when testing the reserve sample, you immediately notify the receiving facility; and</P>
                      <P>(vi) You document all actions regarding the conditional final release of the drug product, including the justification for the release, all followup actions, results of completed testing, all notifications, and corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the malfunction involving analytical equipment.</P>
                      <P>(2) Even if the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are met, you may not approve the conditional final release of the product if the malfunction involving analytical equipment prevents the performance of a radiochemical identity/purity test or prevents the determination of the product's specific activity.</P>
                      <P>(3) You may not release another batch of the PET drug product until you have corrected the problem concerning the malfunction of analytical equipment and completed the omitted finished-product test.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Bulk drug substances that can be used to compound drug products in accordance with section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) The following bulk drug substances can be used in compounding under section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
                      <P>(1) Brilliant Blue G, also known as Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.</P>

                      <P>(5) Squaric acid dibutyl ester (for topical use only).</P>
                      <P>(6) Thymol iodide (for topical use only).</P>
                      <P>(b) After balancing the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, FDA has determined that the following bulk drug substances will not be included on the list of substances that can be used in compounding set forth in paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
                      <P>(1) Oxitriptan.</P>
                      <P>(2) Piracetam.</P>
                      <P>(3) Silver Protein Mild.</P>
                      <P>(4) Tranilast.</P>
                      <P>(c) FDA will use the following criteria in evaluating substances considered for inclusion on the list set forth in paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
                      <P>(1) The physical and chemical characterization of the substance;</P>
                      <P>(2) Any safety issues raised by the use of the substance in compounded drug products;</P>
                      <P>(3) The available evidence of the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of a drug product compounded with the substance, if any such evidence exists; and</P>
                      <P>(4) Historical use of the substance in compounded drug products, including information about the medical condition(s) the substance has been used to treat and any references in peer-reviewed medical literature.</P>
                      <P>(d) Based on evidence currently available, there are inadequate data to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of any drug product compounded using any of the drug substances listed in paragraph (a) of this section, or to establish general recognition of the safety or effectiveness of any such drug product. Any person who represents that a compounded drug made with a bulk drug substance that appears on this list is FDA approved, or otherwise endorsed by FDA generally or for a particular indication, will cause the drug to be misbranded under section 502(a) and/or 502(bb) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Current good manufacturing practice.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides that a drug (including a drug contained in a medicated feed) shall be deemed to be adulterated if the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the requirement of the act as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is represented to possess.</P>

                      <P>(b)(1) The provisions of this part set forth the criteria for determining whether the manufacture of a medicated feed is in compliance with current good manufacturing practice. These regulations shall apply to all types of facilities and equipment used in the production of medicated feeds, and they shall also govern those instances in which failure to adhere to the regulations has caused nonmedicated feeds that are manufactured, <PRTPAGE P="192"/>processed, packed, or held to be adulterated. In such cases, the medicated feed shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the act, and the nonmedicated feed shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the act.</P>
                      <P>(2) The regulations in §§ 225.10 through 225.115 apply to facilities manufacturing one or more medicated feeds for which an approved medicated feed mill license is required. The regulations in §§ 225.120 through 225.202 apply to facilities manufacturing solely medicated feeds for which an approved license is not required.</P>
                      <P>(c) In addition to the recordkeeping requirements in this part, Type B and Type C medicated feeds made from Type A articles or Type B feeds under approved NADAs or indexed listings and a medicated feed mill license are subject to the requirements of § 510.301 of this chapter.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Thyroid-containing drug preparations intended for treatment of obesity in humans.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Investigation by the Food and Drug Administration has revealed that a large number of drug preparations containing thyroid or thyrogenic substances in combination with central nervous system stimulants, with or without one or more additional drug substances such as barbiturates or laxatives, are being marketed for or as adjuncts to the treatment, control, or management of obesity in humans. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that the administration of such combinations for said purposes is without medical rationale except possibly in those relatively uncommon instances where the condition is directly related to hypothyroidism and there exists a concurrent need for appetite control (in such instances the safety and effectiveness of such combinations are not generally recognized). In particular, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that neither the consensus of informed medical opinion nor clinical experience justifies any representation that such combinations are safe and effective in connection with the treatment, control, or management of obesity in patients having normal thyroid function.</P>
                      <P>(b) Combinations of thyroid or other thyrogenic drugs with central nervous system stimulants with or without other drug substances when offered for or as adjuncts to the treatment, control, or management of obesity not related to hypothyroidism are regarded as misbranded. Such combinations when offered for obesity in humans directly attributable to established hypothyroidism are regarded as new drugs within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Stramonium preparations labeled with directions for use in self-medication regarded as misbranded.</SUBJECT>

                      <P>(a) Stramonium products for inhalation have been offered for use in the therapy of the acute attacks of bronchial asthma for many years although their reliability and effectiveness are questionable. Recently, a significantly increased number of reports have come to the attention of the Food and Drug Administration showing that such products have been subject to abuse and misuse on a fairly large scale, mostly by young people, through oral <PRTPAGE P="204"/>ingestion for the purpose of producing hallucinations. Reports of such use have been received from physicians and police and other law enforcement authorities. Reports have also appeared in the public press and in medical journals.</P>
                      <P>(b) Labeling these products with a warning that they are not for oral ingestion has not been effective in protecting the public. Misuse of stramonium preparations can cause serious toxic effects including toxic delirium, visual disturbances, fever, and coma. A number of serious reactions have already occurred from the oral ingestion of such products.</P>
                      <P>(c) On the basis of this information, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that such articles have a potentiality for harmful effect through misuse and are not safe for use except under the supervision of a physician. In the interest of public health protection, therefore, the Food and Drug Administration adopts the following policy:</P>
                      <P>(1) Preparations containing stramonium supplied from the leaves, seeds, or any other part of the plant in the form of a powder, pipe mixture, cigarette, or any other form, with or without admixture of other ingredients, will be regarded as misbranded if they are labeled with directions for use in self-medication.</P>
                      <P>(2) The Food and Drug Administration will, on request, furnish comment on proposed labeling limiting any such preparation to prescription sale.</P>

                      <P>(d) The labeling or dispensing of stramonium preparations contrary to this statement after 60 days following the date of its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> may be made the subject of regulatory proceedings.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Amyl nitrite inhalant as a prescription drug for human use.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Amyl nitrite inhalant has been available over-the-counter for emergency use by the patient in the management of angina pectoris for a number of years. As a result of a proposed policy statement published August 25, 1967 (32 FR 12404), the Commissioner of Food and Drugs received reports of the abuse of this drug by those who do not require it for medical purposes. Additionally, comment included a great deal of concern expressed by individual physicians, medical associations, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, and State and local health authorities. Based on the information available, it is the opinion of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, concurred in by the Food and Drug Administration Medical Advisory Board, that amyl nitrite inhalant is a drug with a potentiality for harmful effect and that it should be removed from over-the-counter status and restricted to sale on the prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.</P>
                      <P>(b) Therefore, amyl nitrite inhalant will be regarded as misbranded unless the labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its safe and effective use by physicians, in accordance with § 201.100(c) of this chapter, and its label bears the statement “Rx only.”</P>
                      <P>(c) Regulatory proceedings may be initiated with regard to the interstate shipment of amyl nitrite inhalant that is labeled, advertised, or dispensed contrary to this statement of policy if such act occurs after July 1, 1969.</P>

                      <P>(a) Recurring reports of abuse and misuse of methamphetamine (also known as desoxyephedrine) inhalers show that they have a potentiality for harmful effect and that they should not be freely available to the public through over-the-counter sale. From complaints by law-enforcement officials, health officials, individual physicians, parents, and others as well as from Food and Drug Administration investigations, it is evident that the wicks from these inhalers are being removed and the methamphetamine they contain is being used as a substitute for amphetamine tablets. Amphetamine tablets and amphetamine inhalers have been restricted to prescription <PRTPAGE P="205"/>sale because of their potentiality for harm to the user.</P>
                      <P>(b) It is the considered opinion of the Food and Drug Administration that, in order to adequately protect the public health, inhalers containing methamphetamine or methamphetamine salts (d-desoxyephedrine, or dl-desoxyephedrine, or their salts), as well as amphetamine inhalers should be restricted to prescription sale and should be labeled with the statement “Rx only.”</P>

                      <P>(a)(1) The Food and Drug Administration finds that the following “coronary vasodilators” are extensively regarded by physicians as safe and useful as employed under medical supervision for the management of angina pectoris in some patients:

                      <P>(b) The Food and Drug Administration also finds that there is neither substantial evidence of effectiveness nor a general recognition by qualified experts that such drugs are effective for any of the other purposes for which some such drugs are promoted to the medical profession in labeling and advertising. In particular, neither clinical investigations nor clinical experience justify any representations that such drugs are effective in the management of hypertension; in the management of coronary insufficiency or coronary artery disease, except for their anginal manifestations; or in the management of the post coronary state, except angina pectoris present after coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction.</P>
                      <P>(c) Any preparation containing such drugs that is labeled or advertised for any use other than management of angina pectoris, or that is represented to be efficacious for any other purpose by reason of its containing such drug, will be regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as misbranded and subject to regulatory proceedings, unless such recommendations are covered by the approval of a new-drug application based on a showing of safety and effectiveness.</P>
                      <P>(d) Any such drug in long-acting dosage form is regarded as a new drug that requires an approved new-drug application before marketing.</P>
                      <P>(e) Any of the drugs listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is regarded as a new drug that requires an approved new-drug application. Articles for which new-drug approvals are now in effect should be covered by supplemental new-drug applications as necessary to provide for labeling revisions consistent with this policy statement.</P>

                      <P>It is the consensus of informed medical opinion that the margin of safety between the therapeutic and toxic concentration of gelsemium is narrow and it is difficult to predict the point at which the dose will be toxic. Very small doses may cause toxic symptoms. It is therefore the view of the Food and Drug Administration that gelsemium is not a proper ingredient in any product that is to be sold without prescription. Accordingly, any drug containing gelsemium will be regarded as misbranded under section 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if its label fails to bear in a prominent and conspicuous fashion the statement “Rx only.”</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Potassium permanganate preparations as prescription drugs.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) There have been a number of reports in the medical literature of serious injuries to women resulting from the misuse of potassium permanganate in an effort to induce abortion. Reports from physicians who have treated such cases show that the injuries are commonly caused by introducing tablets or crystals of potassium permanganate into the vagina. Experience with these cases shows that such use of potassium permanganate is not effective in producing abortion, but that instead the drug produces serious and painful injury to the walls of the vagina, causing ulcers, massive hemorrhage, and infection. Such dangerous and useless employment of potassium permanganate is apparently encouraged among the misinformed by the mistaken idea that the vaginal bleeding caused by the corrosive action of the drug indicates a termination of pregnancy, which it does not.</P>
                      <P>(b) Potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent, a highly caustic, tissue-destroying chemical, and a poison. There are no circumstances under which crystals and tablets of potassium permanganate constitute safe dosage forms for use in self-medication. It is the consensus of informed medical opinion that the only dosage forms of potassium permanganate known to be safe for use in self-medication are aqueous solutions containing not more than 0.04 percent potassium permanganate. Such solutions are safe for use in self-medication only by external application to the skin.</P>
                      <P>(c) In view of the very real potentiality for harmful effect, and the actual injuries caused by the misuse of potassium permanganate, the Food and Drug Administration believes that in order adequately to protect the public health:</P>
                      <P>(1) Potassium permanganate and potassium permanganate tablets intended for human use are drugs subject to section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and should be restricted to prescription sale. Such drugs will be regarded as misbranded if at any time prior to dispensing the label fails to bear the statement “Rx only.”</P>
                      <P>(2) Potassium permanganate labeled for use as a prescription component in human drugs under the exemption provided in § 201.120 of this chapter or labeled for manufacturing use under the exemption provided in § 201.122 of this chapter will be regarded as misbranded unless the label bears the statement, “Rx only.”</P>

                      <P>(3) These drugs will be regarded as misbranded when intended for veterinary use unless the label bears the legend, “Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to sale by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian”; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That this shall not apply to a drug labeled and marketed for veterinary use if such drug contains not more than 50 percent of potassium permanganate and includes other ingredients which make it unsuitable for human use and unlikely that the article would be used in an attempt to induce abortion.</P>
                      <P>(4) Any preparation of potassium permanganate intended for over-the-counter sale for human use internally or by application to any mucous membranes or for use in the vagina will be regarded as misbranded under the provisions of section 502(f) (1) and (2) and section 502(j) of the act.</P>
                      <P>(5) Any other preparation of potassium permanganate intended for over-the-counter sale for human use will be regarded as misbranded under section 502(f) (1) and (2) and section 502(j) of the act unless, among other things, all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                      <P>(i) It is an aqueous solution containing not more than 0.04 percent potassium permanganate.</P>
                      <P>(ii) The label and labeling bear, in juxtaposition with adequate directions for use, clear warning statements designated as “Warning,” and to the effect: “Warning—For external use on the skin only.

                      <SUBJECT>Preparations for the treatment of pernicious anemia.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) The ninth announcement of the Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board of the United States Pharmacopeia is concerned with the status of the treatment of pernicious anemia. It clearly presents the following facts:</P>
                      <P>(1) The Sixteenth Revision of the Pharmacopeia of the United States, which became official on October 1, 1960, does not include preparations intended for the treatment of pernicious anemia by oral administration.</P>
                      <P>(2) The U.S.P. unit for anti-anemia preparations no longer has any significance.</P>
                      <P>(3) The U.S.P. Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board was disbanded.</P>
                      <P>(b) On the basis of the scientific evidence and conclusions summarized in the statement of the U.S.P. Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board as well as pertinent information from other sources, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds it is the consensus of well informed medical opinion that:</P>

                      <P>(1) The parenteral administration of cyanocobalamin or vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> is generally recognized as a fully effective treatment of pernicious anemia. Parenteral cyanocobalamin preparations have not been and are not authorized for use except by or on the prescription of a duly licensed medical practitioner.</P>
                      <P>(2) Some patients afflicted with pernicious anemia do not respond to orally ingested products. There is no known way to predict which patients will fail to respond or will cease to respond to the treatment of pernicious anemia with orally ingested preparations.</P>

                      <P>(3) The substitution of a possibly inadequate treatment, such as the ingestion of oral preparations of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> with intrinsic factor concentrate, in place of parenteral vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> products for a disease condition as serious as pernicious anemia cannot be regarded as safe in all cases.</P>
                      <P>(4) The development of the classical symptoms of pernicious anemia that would cause a person to seek medical attention may in some cases be delayed by oral ingestion of intrinsic factor. Pernicious anemia is a disease that is associated, among other things, with a higher than normal incidence of cancer of the stomach and that for the safety of the patient, requires continuous expert medical supervision.</P>
                      <P>(5) With inadequate treatment there may be markedly deleterious effects on the nervous system. It is well established that whereas the development of anemia is completely reversible with adequate treatment, the involvement of the nervous system may not be completely reversible and thus may result in permanent damage.</P>

                      <P>(6) Some hematologists prescribe oral preparations of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> in the treatment of pernicious-anemia patients.</P>

                      <P>(7) Intrinsic factor and intrinsic factor concentrate serve no known useful therapeutic or nutritive purpose except to the extent that they do increase the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> in patients with a deficiency or absence of intrinsic factor, which may eventually lead to pernicious anemia. This conclusion does not apply to diagnostic procedures using radioactive cyanocobalamin.</P>
                      <P>(8) Medical expertise is required for the diagnosis as well as the management of pernicious anemia.</P>

                      <P>(c) The Eleventh Edition of The National Formulary and its first Interim Revision include monographs for oral preparations of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> with intrinsic factor concentrate, establish a unit of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> with intrinsic factor concentrate, and provide for a National Formulary Anti-anemia Preparations Advisory Board to assign the potency of such preparations. This provides for the availability of such oral preparations, standardized within the meaning of the broad limits characteristic of the evaluation of such preparations.</P>

                      <P>(d) Any drug that is offered for or purports to contain intrinsic factor or <PRTPAGE P="208"/>intrinsic factor concentrate will be regarded as misbranded within the meaning of section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless it is labeled with the statement “Rx only.”</P>
                      <P>(e) Any drug for oral ingestion intended, represented, or advertised for the prevention or treatment of pernicious anemia or which purports to contain any substance or mixture of substances described in paragraph (d) of this section (other than diagnostic drugs containing radioactive cyanocobalamin) will be regarded as misbranded under sections 502 (f)(2) and (j) of the act unless its labeling bears a statement to the effect that some patients afflicted with pernicious anemia may not respond to the orally ingested product and that there is no known way to predict which patients will respond or which patients may cease to respond to the orally ingested products. The labeling shall also bear a statement that periodic examinations and laboratory studies of pernicious anemia patients are essential and recommended.</P>
                      <P>(f) Under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, intrinsic factor and intrinsic factor concentrate are regarded as food additives. No food additive regulation nor existing extension of the effective date of section 409 of the act authorizes these additives in foods, including foods for special dietary uses. Any food containing added intrinsic factor or intrinsic factor concentrate will be regarded as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C) of the act.</P>

                      <P>(g) Regulatory action may be initiated with respect to any article shipped within the jurisdiction of the act contrary to the provisions of this policy statement after the 180th day following publication of this statement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

                      <SUBJECT>Hexachlorophene, as a component of drug and cosmetic products.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Antibacterial component.</E> The use of hexachlorophene as an antibacterial component in drug and cosmetic products has expanded widely in recent years. It is used in such products because of its bacteriostatic action against gram-positive organisms, especially against strains of staphylococcus; however, hexachlorophene offers no protection against gram-negative infections. In addition the antibacterial activity depends largely on repeated use. A notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of April 4, 1972 (37 FR 6775), invited data on OTC antimicrobial ingredients, including hexachlorophene, for review by an OTC Drug Advisory Review Panel to be convened under the procedures set forth in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464). This statement of policy will remain in effect unless and until replaced by a monograph resulting from the OTC Drug Advisory Review Panel.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Adverse effects.</E> Though considered safe for many years, recent information has become available associating hexachlorophene with toxic effects, including deaths. Studies have shown that toxic amounts of hexachlorophene can be absorbed through the skin of humans, especially the skin of premature babies or damaged skin. Human toxicity reports include data on symptomatology, blood and tissue levels of hexachlorophene, and descriptions of neuropathologic lesions. Recent infant deaths due to use of baby powder accidentally contaminated with 6 percent hexachlorophene have occurred. The accumulated evidence of toxicity is sufficient to require that continued marketing of hexachlorophene containing products be carefully defined in order to protect consumers.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Prescription drugs.</E> (1) Because of their potential for harmful effect, drugs containing hexachlorophene, other than as a preservative as described below, are not considered to <PRTPAGE P="209"/>have been shown to be safe and effective, are regarded as new drugs requiring approved new drug applications, and would be misbranded for over-the-counter distribution. In the interest of public health protection, hexachlorophene containing drugs will be regarded as misbranded and subject to regulatory proceedings unless the label bears the statement “Rx only,” and the labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its safe and effective use by practitioners, in accord with § 201.100(c) of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(2) The Food and Drug Administration recognizes that hexachlorophene is useful as a bacteriostatic skin cleanser. It further concludes that the margin of safety is such that products containing hexachlorophene may appropriately be used within clearly delineated conditions of use.</P>
                      <P>(3) In order for such drugs to bear adequate information for safe and effective use the following statements are representative of the type of labeling for products shown to be effective bacteriostatic skin cleansers. Labeling for products other than bacteriostatic skin cleansers will be determined through the new drug procedures based on the available data.</P>

                      <P>(i) In the labeling other than on the immediate container label.

                        <P>Rinse thoroughly after use. Patients should be closely monitored and use should be immediately discontinued at the first sign of any of the symptoms described below.</P>
                        <P>Hexachlorophene is rapidly absorbed and may produce toxic blood levels when applied to skin lesions such as ichthyosis congenita or the dermatitis of Letterer-Siwe's syndrome or other generalized dermatologic conditions. Application to burns has also produced neurotoxicity and death.</P>
                        <P>Infants have developed dermatitis, irritability, generalized clonic muscular contractions and decerebrate rigidity following application of a 6 percent hexachlorophene powder. Examination of brainstems of those infants revealed vacuolization like that which can be produced in newborn experimental animals following repeated topical application of 3 percent hexachlorophene. Moreover, a study of histologic sections of premature infants who died of unrelated causes has shown a positive correlation between hexachlorophene baths and lesions in white matter of brains.</P>

                      <P>(4) Marketing of products for the indications listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section may be continued without an approved new drug application (or required supplement thereto) either until a notice of opportunity for hearing is issued on a proposal by the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to refuse to approve such new drug application (or required supplement) or until January 31, 1978, whichever comes first, if all the following conditions were met after September 27, 1972:</P>
                      <P>(i) The product is labeled with the statement “Rx only” and adequate information for safe and effective use as set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Within 30 days, or by (10-27-72) the holder of an approved new drug application submits a supplement to provide for the revised label and full disclosure labeling. As the label and labeling will have been put into use, the supplement should be submitted under the provision of § 314.70(c)(6)(iii) of this chapter.</P>

                      <P>(iii) Within 30 days, or by (10-27-72) the holder of an approved new drug application submits a supplement to provide for a revised formulation where appropriate to comply with this order.<PRTPAGE P="210"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(iv) Within 90 days, or by (12-26-72) the holder of an approved new drug application submits a supplement containing blood level data obtained from use of the drug as recommended, unless such information is a part of the new drug application file.</P>
                      <P>(v) Within 90 days, or by (12-26-72), the manufacturer or distributor of such a drug for which a new drug approval is not in effect submits a new drug application in accord with § 314.50 of the new drug regulations (21 CFR 314.50), including blood level data obtained from use of the drug as recommended.</P>
                      <P>(5) Prescription drug products may contain hexachlorophene as part of an effective preservative system only under the conditions and limitations provided for under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

Such use of hexachlorophene shall be limited to situations where an alternative preservative has not yet been shown to be as effective or where adequate integrity and stability data for the reformulated product are not yet available. This use of hexachlorophene will not, by itself, require an approved new drug application. Use of hexachlorophene as a preservative at a level higher than 0.1 percent is regarded as a new drug use requiring an approved new drug application, which must be submitted within the time set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Cosmetics.</E> Hexachlorophene may be used as a preservative in cosmetic products other than those which in normal use may be applied to mucous membranes or which are intended to be used on mucous membranes, at a level that is no higher than necessary to achieve the intended preservative function, and in no event higher than 0.1 percent. Such use of hexachlorophene shall be limited to situations where an alternative preservative has not yet been shown to be as effective or where adequate integrity and stability data for the reformulated product are not yet available. The component of a preservative system whether hexachlorophene or other antimicrobial agent, should be selected on the basis of the effect on the total microbial ecology of the product, not merely on gram-positive bacteria.</P>
                      <P>(1) Adequate safety data do not presently exist to justify wider use of hexachlorophene in cosmetics.</P>
                      <P>(2) Antibacterial ingredients used as substitutes for hexachlorophene in cosmetic products, and finished cosmetic products containing such ingredients, shall be adequately tested for safety prior to marketing. Any such ingredient or product whose safety is not adequately substantiated prior to marketing may be adulterated and will in any event be deemed misbranded unless it contains a conspicuous front panel statement that the product has not been adequately tested for safety and may be hazardous.</P>

                      <P>(a) As used in this part 299, <E T="03">act</E> means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, sections 201-902, 52 Stat. 1040 (21 U.S.C. 321-392), with all amendments thereto.</P>
                      <P>(b) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of the act shall be applicable to such terms when used in this part 299.</P>
                      <P>(c) The term <E T="03">official name</E> means, with respect to a drug or ingredient thereof, the name designated in this part 299 under section 508 of the act as the official name.</P>

                    <SECTION>
                      <SECTNO>§ 299.4</SECTNO>
                      <SUBJECT>Established names for drugs.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Section 508 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (added by the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments of 1962; Pub. L. 87-781) authorizes the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to designate an official name for any drug if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity. Section 502(e) of the act (as amended by said Drug Amendments) prescribes that the labeling of a drug must bear its established name, if there is one, to the exclusion of any other nonproprietary name (except the applicable systematic chemical name or the chemical formula) and, if the drug is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the established name of each active ingredient.</P>
                      <P>(b) The term <E T="03">established name</E> is defined in section 502(e)(3) of the act as (1) an official name designated pursuant to section 508 of the act; (2) if no such official name has been designated for the drug and the drug is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium; and (3) if neither paragraphs (b) (1) or (2) of this section applies, then the common or usual name of the drug.</P>
                      <P>(c) The Food and Drug Administration recognizes the skill and experience of the U.S. Adopted Names Council (USAN) in deriving names for drugs. The U.S. Adopted Names Council is a private organization sponsored by the American Medical Association, the United States Pharmacopeia, and the American Pharmaceutical Association, and has been engaged in the assignment of names to drugs since January 1964. The Council negotiates with manufacturing firms in the selection of nonproprietary names for drugs.</P>

                      <P>(d) The Food and Drug Administration cooperates with and is represented on the USAN Council. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration agrees with “Guiding Principles for Coining U.S. Adopted Names for Drugs,” published in <E T="03">USAN and the USP Dictionary of Drug Names</E> (USAN 1985 ed., 1961-1984 cumulative list), which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from: U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 12601 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852, or are available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</E> All applicants for new-drug applications and sponsors for “Investigational New Drug Applications” (IND's) are encouraged to contact the USAN Council for assistance in selection of a simple and useful <PRTPAGE P="213"/>name for a new chemical entity. Approval of a new-drug application providing for the use of a new drug substance may be delayed if a simple and useful nonproprietary name does not exist for the substance and if one is not proposed in the application that meets the above-cited guidelines. Prior use of a name in the medical literature or otherwise will not commit the Food and Drug Administration to adopting such terminology as official.</P>

                      <P>(e) The Food and Drug Administration will not routinely designate official names under section 508 of the act. As a result, the established name under section 502(e) of the act will ordinarily be either the compendial name of the drug or, if there is no compendial name, the common and usual name of the drug. Interested persons, in the absence of the designation by the food and Drug Administration of an official name, may rely on as the established name for any drug the current compendial name or the USAN adopted name listed in <E T="03">USAN and the USP Dictionary of Drug Names.</E> The Food and Drug Administration, however, will continue to publish official names under the provisions of section 508 of the act when the agency determines that:</P>
                      <P>(1) The USAN or other official or common or usual name is unduly complex or is not useful for any other reason;</P>
                      <P>(2) Two or more official names have been applied to a single drug, or to two or more drugs that are identical in chemical structure and pharmacological action and that are substantially identical in strength, quality, and purity; or</P>
                      <P>(3) No USAN or other official or common or usual name has been applied to a medically useful drug. Any official name published under section 508 of the act will be the established name of the drug.</P>

                      <P>(f) A cumulative list of U.S. adopted names selected and released since June 15, 1961, is published yearly by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., in <E T="03">USAN and the USP Dictionary of Drug Names.</E> Copies may be purchased from the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 12601 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852.</P>

                      <P>(b) The term <E T="03">drug defined in an official compendium</E> means a drug having the identity prescribed for a drug in an official compendium.</P>
                      <P>(c) A statement that a drug defined in an official compendium differs in strength, quality, or purity from the standard of strength, quality, or purity set forth for such drug in an official compendium shall show all the respects in which such drug so differs, and the extent of each such difference.</P>
