      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

The payment of an application-commitment fee shall not be required in connection with an insured mortgage involving the sale by the government of housing or property acquired, held, or contracted pursuant to the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 (42 U.S.C. 2301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Existing projects.</E> For a mortgage being insured under section 223(f) of the Act, if the application provides for the completion of repairs, replacements and/or improvements (repairs), the Commissioner will charge an inspection fee equal to one percent (1%) of the cost of the repairs. However, where the Commissioner determines the cost of repairs is minimal, the Commissioner may establish a minimum inspection fee that exceeds one percent of the cost of repairs and can periodically increase or decrease this minimum fee.</P>

If an inspection fee was required in the original commitment, an additional inspection fee shall be paid in an amount computed at the same dollar rate per thousand dollars of the amount of increase in commitment as was used for the inspection fee required in the original commitment. When insurance of advances is involved, the additional inspection fee shall be paid at the time of initial endorsement. When insurance upon completion is involved, <PRTPAGE P="15"/>the additional inspection fee shall be paid before the date construction is begun; or, if construction has begun, it shall be paid with the application for increase.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Increase in mortgage between initial and final endorsement.</E> Upon the filing of an application between initial and final endorsement, for an increase in the amount of the mortgage, either by amendment or by substitution of a new mortgage, a combined additional application and commitment fee shall accompany the application. This combined additional fee shall be in an amount that will aggregate $5 per thousand dollars of the amount of the increase requested. If an inspection fee was required in the original commitment, an additional inspection fee shall accompany the application in an amount not to exceed the $5 per thousand dollars of the amount of the increase requested.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Loan to cover operating losses.</E> In connection with a loan to cover operating losses (see Sec. 200.22), a combined application and commitment fee of $5 per thousand dollars of the amount of the loan applied for shall be submitted with the application for a firm commitment. No inspection fee shall be required.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Reopening of expired commitments.</E> An expired commitment may be reopened if a request for reopening is received by the Commissioner within 90 days of the expiration of the commitment. The reopening request shall be accompanied by a fee of 50 cents per thousand dollars of the amount of the expired commitment. If the reopening request is not received by the Commissioner within the required 90-day period, a new application, accompanied by the required application and commitment fee, must be submitted.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Transfer fee.</E> Upon application for the approval of a transfer of physical assets or the substitution of mortgagors, a transfer fee of 50 cents per thousand dollars shall be paid on the original face amount of the mortgage in all cases, except that a transfer fee shall not be paid where both parties to the transfer transaction are nonprofit purchasers, or when the transfer of physical assets or the substitution of mortgagors occurs contemporaneously with the restructuring of a mortgage pursuant to a restructuring plan under part 401, subpart C of this title.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Refund of fees.</E> If the amount of the commitment issued or increase in mortgage granted is less than the amount applied for, the Commissioner shall refund the excess amount of the application and commitment fees submitted by the applicant. If an application is rejected before it is assigned for processing, or in such other instances as the Commissioner may determine, the entire application and commitment fee or any portion thereof may be returned to the applicant. Commitment, inspection and reopening fees may be refunded, in whole or in part, if it is determined by the Commissioner that there is a lack of need for the housing or that the construction or financing of the project has been prevented because of condemnation proceedings or other legal action taken by a governmental body or public agency, or in such other instances as the Commissioner may determine. A transfer fee may be refunded only in such instances as the Commissioner may determine.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Fees not required.</E> (1) The payment of an application, commitment, inspection, or reopening fee shall not be required in connection with the insurance of a mortgage involving the sale by the Secretary of any property acquired under any section or title of the Act.</P>
                  <P>(2) The payment of an application or commitment fee shall not be required in connection with the insurance of a mortgage used to facilitate a restructuring plan under part 401, subpart C of this title.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Processing of applications.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Preapplication conference.</E> Except for mortgages insured under section 241(f) or 242 of the Act, the local HUD Office will determine whether participation in such a conference is required as a condition to submission of an initial application for either a site appraisal and market analysis (SAMA) letter (for new construction), a feasibility letter (for substantial rehabilitation), or for a firm commitment. The project sponsor may elect (after the preapplication conference if required) to submit an application for a SAMA or a feasibility letter (as appropriate), or for a firm commitment for insurance depending upon the completeness of the drawings, specifications and other required exhibits. An application for a SAMA or feasibility letter may be submitted by the project sponsor. An application for a firm commitment for insurance must be submitted by both the project sponsor and an approved mortgagee. Applications shall be submitted to the local HUD Office on HUD-approved forms. No application will be considered unless accompanied by all exhibits required by the form and program handbooks. At the option of the local HUD Office, the SAMA/Feasibility letter stage of processing can be combined with the firm commitment stage of processing.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Firm commitment requirement.</E> An application for a firm commitment must be made by an approved mortgagee for any project for which a mortgagor seeks mortgage insurance under the Act.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Staged applications.</E> Staged applications leading to an application for firm commitment shall be made as determined appropriate by the Commissioner, and in accordance with such terms and conditions established by the Commissioner. The intermediate stages to firm commitment may include a site appraisal and market analysis (SAMA) letter stage or a feasibility letter stage and a conditional commitment. The conditional commitment stage applies only to mortgages to be insured pursuant to section 223(f) of the Act.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of SAMA letter, feasibility letter, and firm commitment</E>—(1) <E T="03">SAMA letter.</E> (i) The issuance of a SAMA letter indicates completion of the site appraisal and market analysis stage to determine initial acceptability of the site and recognition of a specific market need. The SAMA letter is not a commitment to insure a mortgage for the proposed project and does not bind the Commissioner to issue a firm commitment to insure. The SAMA letter precedes the later submission of acceptable plans and specifications for the proposed project and is limited to advising the applicant as to the following determinations of the Commissioner, which shall not be changed to the detriment of an applicant, if the application for a firm commitment is received before expiration of the SAMA letter:</P>
                  <P>(A) The land value fully improved (with off-site improvements installed);</P>
                  <P>(B) The acceptability of the proposed project site, the proposed composition, number and size of the units and the market for the number of proposed units. Where the application is not acceptable as submitted, but can be made acceptable by a change in the number, size, or composition of the units, the SAMA letter may establish the specific lesser number of units which would be acceptable and any acceptable alternative plan for the composition and size of units; and</P>
                  <P>(C) The acceptability of the unit rents proposed. Where rent levels are unacceptable, the SAMA letter may establish specific rents which are acceptable.</P>
                  <P>(ii) After receiving a SAMA letter, the sponsor shall submit design drawings and specifications in a timeframe prescribed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will review and comment on design development and the drawings and specifications. The comments will be provided to the sponsor for use in preparing a firm commitment application.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Feasibility letter.</E> The issuance of a feasibility letter indicates approval of the preliminary work write-up and outline specifications and completion of <PRTPAGE P="17"/>technical processing involving the estimated rehabilitation cost of the project, the “as is” value of the site, the detailed estimates of operating expenses and taxes, the specific unit rents, the vacancy allowance, and the estimated mortgage amount. The issuance of a feasibility letter is not a commitment to insure a mortgage for the proposed project and does not bind the Commissioner to issue a firm commitment to insure. Determinations found in a feasibility letter are not to be binding upon the Department and may be changed in whole or in part at any later point in time. The letter may even be unilaterally terminated by the Commissioner if found necessary.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Conditional commitment.</E> The issuance of a Section 223(f) conditional commitment indicates completion of technical processing involving the estimated value of the property, the detailed estimates of rents, operating expenses and taxes and an estimated mortgage amount.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Term of SAMA letter, feasibility letter, and conditional commitment.</E> A SAMA letter, a feasibility letter, and a conditional commitment shall be effective for whatever term is specified in the respective letter or commitment.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Rejection of an application.</E> A significant deviation in an application from the Commissioner's terms or conditions in an earlier stage application commitment or agreement shall be grounds for rejection. The fees paid to such date shall be considered as having been earned notwithstanding such rejection.</P>

                  <P>(2) In jurisdictions that do not provide building code enforcement and requisite documentation, three inspections are required for new construction. For existing construction, only one inspection and certification of work completed for structural repairs and renovations is required. For both new and existing construction, the lender shall, in order to ensure compliance with FHA requirements:</P>
                  <P>(i) Select a Residential Combination Inspector (or its successor designation) or a Combination Inspector (or its successor designation) certified by the International Code Council (or its successor organization) who is licensed or certified as a home inspector in accordance with the applicable State and local requirements governing the licensing or certification of those jurisdictions that license or certify such inspectors in the respective jurisdiction. The lender shall provide a certification from such inspector that the new construction and/or structural repair or renovation work is completed satisfactorily and in compliance with any applicable building code.</P>

                  <P>(ii) In the absence of such Residential Combination Inspector and Combination Inspector, the lender shall obtain an inspection performed by a third party, who is a registered architect, a professional engineer, or a trades person or contractor, and who has met the licensing and bonding requirements of the State in which the property is located. The lender shall provide a certification from such inspector that the inspector is licensed and bonded under applicable State law, and that the new construction and/or structural repair <PRTPAGE P="26"/>or renovation work is completed satisfactorily and in compliance with any applicable building code.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Nonprofit Organization Roster.</E> HUD maintains a roster of nonprofit organizations that are qualified to participate in certain specified FHA activities. In order to be recognized as a nonprofit organization for purposes of single family regulations in this chapter, an organization must:</P>
                  <P>(1) Be included in the Roster; and</P>
                  <P>(2) Comply with any requirements stated in a specific applicable provision of the single family regulations in this chapter.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Application.</E> To be included in the Roster, a nonprofit organization must apply to HUD using an application (or materials) in a form prescribed by HUD (which may require an affordable housing program narrative for the activities the nonprofit organization proposes to carry out). The nonprofit organization must specify in its application the FHA activities it proposes to carry out.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">HUD response to application.</E> HUD's review of the application will result in one of the following:</P>
                  <P>(1) Approval of the nonprofit organization to participate in all, or some, of the FHA activities specified in its application and the addition of the nonprofit organization to the Roster.</P>
                  <P>(2) Rejection due to deficiencies in the application. HUD will provide the nonprofit organization with a period to correct these deficiencies.</P>
                  <P>(3) Rejection due to the nonprofit organization's failure to submit a program that complies with applicable single family regulations in this chapter, Mortgagee Letters, or other standards or instructions issued by HUD.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Reapplication after two years.</E> The placement of a nonprofit organization on the Roster expires after two years. The nonprofit organization must reapply for placement on the Roster, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, before expiration of the two-year period.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Cause for removal.</E> HUD may remove a nonprofit organization from the FHA Nonprofit Organization Roster established under § 200.194. Removal may be for any cause that HUD determines to be detrimental to FHA or any of its programs, including but not limited to:</P>
                  <P>(1) Failure to comply with applicable single family regulations in this chapter, Mortgagee Letters or other written instructions or standards issued by HUD;</P>
                  <P>(2) Failure to comply with applicable Civil Rights requirements;</P>
                  <P>(3) Holding a significant number of FHA-insured mortgages that are in default, foreclosure, or claim status (in determining the number considered “significant,” HUD may compare the number of insured mortgages held by the nonprofit organization against the similar holdings of other nonprofit organizations);</P>
                  <P>(4) Being debarred or suspended, subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise sanctioned by HUD;</P>
                  <P>(5) Failure to further all objectives described in the affordable housing program narrative;</P>

                  <P>(6) Misrepresentation or fraudulent statements; or<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(7) Failure to respond within a reasonable time to HUD inquiries, including recertification requests or other requests for further documentation.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure for removal.</E> A nonprofit organization that is debarred or suspended or subject to a limited denial of participation will be automatically removed from the FHA Nonprofit Organization Roster. In all other cases, the following procedure for removal applies:</P>
                  <P>(1) HUD will give the nonprofit organization written notice of the proposed removal. The notice will include the reasons for the proposed removal and the duration of the proposed removal.</P>
                  <P>(2) The nonprofit organization will have 20 days from the date of the notice (or longer, if provided in the notice) to submit a written response appealing the proposed removal and to request a conference. A request for a conference must be in writing and must be submitted along with the written response.</P>
                  <P>(3) A HUD official will review the appeal and provide an informal conference if requested. The HUD official will send a response either affirming, modifying, or canceling the removal. The HUD official will not be someone who was involved in HUD's initial removal decision. HUD will respond with a decision within 30 days of receiving the response, or, if the nonprofit organization has requested a conference, within 30 days after the completion of the conference. HUD may extend the 30-day period by providing written notice to the nonprofit organization.</P>
                  <P>(4) If the nonprofit organization does not submit a timely written response, the removal will be effective 20 days after the date of HUD's initial removal notice (or after a longer period provided in the notice). If a written response is submitted, and the initial removal decision is affirmed or modified, the removal will be effective on the date of HUD's notice affirming or modifying the initial removal decision.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Placement on the Roster after removal.</E> A nonprofit organization that has been removed from the FHA Nonprofit Organization Roster may apply for placement on the Roster (in accordance with § 200.194) after the nonprofit organization's removal from the Roster has expired. An application will be rejected if the period for the nonprofit organization's removal from the Roster has not expired.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Other action.</E> Nothing in this section prohibits HUD from taking such other action against a nonprofit organization, as provided in 2 CFR part 2424, or from seeking any other remedy against a nonprofit organization, available to HUD by statute or otherwise.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Appraiser Roster.</E> HUD maintains a list of appraisers. A mortgagee must select only an appraiser from this list for the appraisal of a property that is to be the security for an FHA-insured single family mortgage.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclaimer.</E> Since an appraisal is performed to determine the maximum insurable mortgage and to also protect the FHA insurance funds, the inclusion of an appraiser on the Appraiser Roster does not create or imply a warranty or endorsement to a prospective homebuyer or to any other organization or individual by HUD of the listed appraiser nor does it represent a warranty of any appraisal performed by the listed appraiser. The inclusion of an appraiser on the Appraiser Roster means only that a listed appraiser has met the qualifications and conditions, prescribed by the Secretary, for inclusion on the Appraiser Roster.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Removal from the Appraiser Roster.</E> HUD officials, as designated by the Secretary, may at any time remove a listed appraiser from the Appraiser Roster for cause, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section. The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section do not apply to removal actions taken under any section in 2 CFR part 2424 or to any other remedy against an appraiser, available to HUD by statute or otherwise.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Cause for removal.</E> Cause for removal includes, but is not limited to:</P>

                <P>(ii) Losing standing as a state-certified appraiser due to disciplinary action in any state in which the appraiser is certified;</P>

                <P>(i) You will be given written notice of your proposed removal. The notice will include the reasons for your proposed removal and the duration of your proposed removal.</P>
                <P>(ii) You will have 20 days from the date of your notice of proposed removal to submit a written response appealing the proposed removal and to request a conference. A request for a conference must be in writing and must be submitted along with a written response.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reinstatement.</E> If an appraiser who has been removed from the Roster wants to be reinstated on the Roster, the appraiser must follow the procedures and requirements contained in this subpart for placement on the Roster. Before an appraiser is eligible to reapply for placement on the Roster, the appraiser shall comply with the terms of any applicable remedial training education requirements, and the time period for the appraiser's removal from the Roster shall have expired.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Automatic suspension from Appraiser Roster</E>—(1)<E T="03">Appraisers subject to state disciplinary action.</E> An appraiser whose state certification in any state has been revoked, suspended, or surrendered as a result of a state disciplinary action is automatically suspended from the Appraiser Roster and prohibited from conducting FHA appraisals in any state until HUD receives evidence demonstrating that the state-imposed sanction has been lifted.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Expirations not due to state disciplinary action.</E> An appraiser whose certification in a state has expired is automatically suspended from the Appraiser Roster in that state and may not conduct FHA appraisals in that state until HUD receives evidence that demonstrates renewal, but may continue to perform FHA appraisals in other states in which the appraiser is certified.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Education requirements.</E> Where there is evidence that an appraiser is deficient in FHA appraisal requirements, HUD may require an appraiser to undergo professional training.</P>

Such other sections include:</P>
                <P>(i) Section 244 (coinsurance);</P>
                <P>(ii) Section 213 (cooperative housing insurance);</P>

                <P>(3) Applications for insurance in connection with a refinancing transaction where an appraisal is not required under the applicable procedures established by the Commissioner are excluded from the coverage of this section. Any housing assisted under the programs set out in this section for which no new activity is applied for or required is not covered by this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Appraisal.</E> The appraiser shall, when appraising a dwelling constructed prior to 1978, inspect the dwelling for defective paint surfaces.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Treatment of defective paint surfaces.</E> For defective paint surfaces, treatment shall be provided to defective areas. Treatment of hazards shall consist of covering or removing defective paint surfaces. Covering may be accomplished by such means as adding a layer of wallboard to the wall surface. Depending on the wall condition, wallcoverings which are permanently attached may be used. Covering or replacing trim surfaces is also permitted. Paint removal may be accomplished by such methods as scraping, heat treatment (infra-red or coil type heat guns) or chemicals. Machine sanding and use of propane or gasoline torches (open-flame methods) are not permitted. Washing and repainting without thorough removal or covering does not constitute adequate treatment. In the case of defective paint spots, scraping and repainting the defective area is considered adequate treatment. Treatment of a defective paint surface is not required if such a surface is found to not be a lead-based paint surface by a lead-based paint inspector certified pursuant to procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR part 745.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Home equity conversion mortgage insurance.</E> The requirements of this section, as modified by the following sentence, apply to a dwelling which is the subject of an application for mortgage insurance under section 255 of the National Housing Act (home equity conversion insurance) unless the mortgagor provides the certification described in § 206.45(d) of this title. The defective paint surface may be treated after the mortgage is endorsed for insurance, provided that the defective paint surface is treated as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the repair work provisions contained in § 206.47 of this title.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicable standards and requirements.</E> The physical condition standards and physical inspection requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, are applicable to the properties assisted or insured that are listed in § 200.853.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Entity responsible for inspection of property.</E> The regulations that govern the programs listed in § 200.853, or regulatory agreements or contracts, identify the entity responsible for conducting the physical inspection of the property which is HUD, the lender or the owner. For properties with more than one HUD insured loan, only the first mortgage lender is required to conduct the physical inspection. The second mortgage lender will be provided a copy of the physical inspection report by the first mortgage lender.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing of inspections.</E> (1) For a property subject to an annual inspection under this subpart, the inspection shall be conducted no earlier than 9 months and no later than 15 months from the date of the last required inspection.

                <P>(2) For a property subject to an inspection every two years under this subpart, the inspection shall be conducted no earlier than 21 months and <PRTPAGE P="43"/>no later than 27 months from the date of the last required inspection. In no event, however, shall the physical inspection be conducted after the end of the calendar year following the two year anniversary date of the last required inspection.</P>
                <P>(3) For a property subject to an inspection every three years under this subpart, the inspection shall be conducted no earlier than 33 months and no later than 39 months from the date of the last required inspection. In no event, however, shall the physical inspection be conducted after the end of the calendar year following the three year anniversary date of the last required inspection.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Administrative process for scoring and ranking the physical condition of multifamily housing properties.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scoring and ranking of the physical condition of multifamily housing properties.</E> (1) HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) will score and rank the physical condition of certain multifamily housing insured properties listed in § 200.853 in accordance with the procedures described in this section. The physical condition inspection of the property, upon which REAC bases its score and ranking, is conducted by the responsible entity in accordance with § 200.855.</P>
                <P>(2) Depending upon the results of its physical condition inspection, a multifamily housing property will be assigned one of three designations—standard 1 performing, standard 2 performing and standard 3 performing—in accordance with the ranking process described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Methodology for Ranking.</E> (1) Multifamily housing properties will be ranked in accordance with the methodology provided in this paragraph (b). Multifamily housing properties are scored on the basis of a 100 point scale. Because scores may include fractions, a score that includes a fraction below one half point will be rounded to the next lower full point and a score that includes a fraction of one half point or higher will be rounded to the next higher full point (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 89.4 will be rounded to 89, 89.5 will be rounded to 90).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Standard 1 Performing Property.</E> If a property receives a score of 90 points or higher on its physical condition inspection, the property will be designated a standard 1 performing property. Properties designated as standard 1 performing properties will be required to undergo a physical inspection once every three (3) years.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Standard 2 Performing Property.</E> If a property receives a score of 80 points or higher but less than 90 on its physical condition inspection, the property will be designated a standard 2 performing property. Properties designated as standard 2 performing properties will be required to undergo a <PRTPAGE P="44"/>physical inspection once every two (2) years.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Standard 3 Performing Property.</E> If a property receives a score of less than 80 points, the property will be designated a standard 3 performing property. Properties designated as standard 3 performing properties will continue to undergo an annual physical inspection as currently required under covered HUD programs.</P>
                <P>(2) Owners of multifamily housing properties scoring in a standard 1 or standard 2 range which have been cited by the REAC as having a Exigent Health and Safety (EHS) deficiency(s) must resolve the deficiency(s), as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to be classified as standard 1 and standard 2 properties.</P>
                <P>(3) Regardless of the performance designation assigned to an owner's property, an owner is obligated to maintain its property in accordance with HUD's uniform physical condition standards as required by 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, the Regulatory Agreement and/or the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contract. Good management principles require an owner to conduct routine inspections of its projects, develop improvement plans, and again, maintain its property to meet the standard of decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Owner's review of physical inspection report and identification of objectively verifiable and material error.</E> (1) Upon completion of a physical inspection of a multifamily housing property, the REAC will provide the owner or owner's representative, on the date of the physical inspection, notice of any items classified as EHS deficiencies. REAC also will provide the owner with the entire physical inspection report (electronically through the internet or by mail approximately 10 working days from the date of the report), which provides the physical inspection results and other information relevant to the inspection, including any items classified as EHS deficiencies and already provided to the owner, on the date of the inspection (EHS deficiencies are relayed by the inspector on the date of the inspection).</P>
                <P>(2) The owner must carefully review the physical inspection report, particularly those items classified as EHS. The owner is also responsible for conducting its own survey of the total project based on the REAC's physical inspection findings. The owner must mitigate all EHS items immediately, and the owner must file a written report with the applicable Multifamily Hub Director within 3 business days of the date of the inspection, which is the date the owner was provided with the EHS notice. The report filed by the owner must provide a certification and reasonable evidence that the EHS items have been resolved.</P>
                <P>(3) If, following review of the physical inspection results and score, the owner reasonably believes that an objectively verifiable and material error (or errors) occurred in the inspection, which, if corrected, will result in a significant improvement in the property's overall score (“significant improvement” is defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section), the owner may submit a written request for a technical review. The technical review request must be received in writing no later than 30 calendar days (as established by the postmark, if applicable) from the date the physical inspection results are transmitted to the owner by REAC, whether the results and score are transmitted to the owner via the Internet or by hard copy via certified mail.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Technical review of physical inspection results.</E> A request for a technical review of physical inspection results must be submitted in writing to REAC and must be received by REAC no later than the 30th calendar day, as applicable under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, following submission of the physical inspection report to the owner, as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Request for technical review.</E> The request must be accompanied by the owner's reasonable evidence that an objectively verifiable and material error (or errors) occurred which if corrected will result in a significant improvement in the overall score of the owner's property. A technical review of physical inspection results will not be conducted based on conditions that were corrected subsequent to the inspection. Upon receipt of this request from the owner, the REAC will review <PRTPAGE P="45"/>the physical inspection and the owner's evidence. If the REAC's review determines that an objectively verifiable and material error (or errors) has been documented and that it is likely to result in a significant improvement in the property's overall score, the REAC will take one or a combination of the following actions: undertake a new inspection; correct the original inspection; or issue a new physical condition score.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Burden of proof that error occurred rests with owner.</E> The burden of proof rests with the owner to demonstrate that an objectively verifiable and material error (or errors) occurred in the REAC's inspection through submission of evidence, which if corrected will result in a significant improvement in the property's overall score. To support its request for a technical review of the physical inspection results, the owner may submit photographic evidence, written material from an objective source such as a local fire marshal or building code official, or other similar evidence.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Material errors.</E> An objectively verifiable material error must be present to allow for a technical review of physical inspection results. Material errors are those that exhibit specific characteristics and meet specific thresholds. The three types of material errors are as follows.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Building data error.</E> A building data error occurs if the inspection includes the wrong building or a building that was not owned by the property, including common or site areas that were not a part of the property. Incorrect building data that does not affect the score, such as the address, building name, year built, etc., would not be considered material, but is of great interest to HUD and will be corrected upon notice to the REAC.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Unit count error.</E> A unit count error occurs if the total number of units considered in scoring is incorrect. Since scoring uses total units, the REAC will examine instances where the participant can provide evidence that the total units used is incorrect.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">A non-existent deficiency error.</E> A non-existent deficiency error occurs if the inspection cites a deficiency that does not exist.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Significant improvement.</E> Significant improvement refers to the correction of a material error, asserted by the owner, which causes the score for the owner's property to cross an administratively significant threshold (for example, the property would be redesignated from standard 3 performing to standard 2 performing or from standard 2 performing to standard 1 performing), or to result in an increase of 10 points or more.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Determining whether material error occurred and what action is warranted.</E> Upon receipt of the owner's request for technical review of a property's physical inspection results, the REAC will evaluate the owner's property file and the evidence provided by the owner that an objectively verifiable and material error occurred which, if corrected, would result in a significant improvement in the property's overall score. If the REAC's evaluation determines that an objectively verifiable and material error (or errors) has been reasonably documented by the owner and if corrected would result in a significant improvement in the property's overall score, then the REAC shall take one or a combination of the following actions:</P>
                <P>(i) Undertake a new inspection;</P>
                <P>(ii) Correct the inspection report; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Issue a new physical condition score.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Responsibility for the cost of a new inspection.</E> If a new inspection is undertaken by the REAC and the new inspection score results in a significant improvement in the property's overall score, then HUD shall bear the expense of the new inspection. If no significant improvement occurs, then the owner must bear the expense of the new inspection. The inspection cost of a new inspection, if paid by the owner, is not a valid project operating expense. The new inspection score will be considered the final score.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Adjustment of physical condition score based on considerations other than technical review and reinspection.</E> (1) Under certain circumstances, HUD may find it appropriate to review the results of a physical inspection which are anomalous or have an incorrect result due to facts and circumstances affecting the inspected property which <PRTPAGE P="46"/>are not reflected in the inspection or reflected inappropriately in the inspection. These circumstances include, but are not necessarily limited to, inconsistencies between local code requirements and the HUD physical inspection protocol; conditions which are permitted by variance or license or which are preexisting physical features non-conformities and are inconsistent with the HUD physical condition protocol; or cases where the owner has been scored for elements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> roads, sidewalks, mail boxes, resident owned appliances, etc.) that it does not own and is not responsible for maintaining.</P>
                <P>(2) To seek a score adjustment on the basis of these circumstances as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner must submit a request for an adjustment to REAC with appropriate proof of the circumstances that resulted in the incorrect physical conditions results. This process may result in a reinspection and/or rescoring of the inspection after review and approval of the owner's submission of appropriate proof of the anomalous or inappropriate application.</P>
                <P>(3) An owner may submit the request for this adjustment to REAC either prior to or after the physical inspection has been concluded. If the owner submits a request for adjustment after the physical inspection has been concluded, the owner must submit its request to REAC within 45 days following the submission of the physical inspection report, as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. HUD may, but is not required to review a request made after this period has expired.</P>
                <P>(4) This adjustment process, provided in this paragraph (g), may result in a reinspection and/or rescoring of the inspection after review and approval of the owner's submission of appropriate proof of the anomalous or inappropriate application.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Issuance of final score and publication of score.</E> (1) The physical condition score of the property is the final score if the owner files no request for technical review, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or for other adjustment of the physical condition score, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner files a request for technical review or score adjustments in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, the final physical condition score is the score issued by HUD after any adjustments are determined necessary and made by HUD at the conclusion of these processes.</P>

                <P>(2) HUD will make public the final scores of the owners through posting on HUD's internet site, or through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication or other appropriate means.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Owner's responsibility to notify residents of inspection; and availability of documents to residents</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notification to residents.</E> An owner must notify its residents of any planned physical inspections of their units or the housing development generally.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Availability of documents for review.</E> Once the technical review and database adjustment periods have expired, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, respectively, the owner must make its physical inspection report and all related documents available to its residents during regular business hours upon reasonable request for review and copying. Related documents include the owner's survey plan, plan of correction, certification and related correspondence.</P>
                <P>(i) Once the owner's final physical condition score is issued and published, the owner must make any additional information, such as the results of any reinspection, appeal requests, available for review and copying by its residents upon reasonable request during regular business hours.</P>
                <P>(ii) The owner must maintain the documents related to the physical inspection of the property, as described in this paragraph (g)(2), available for review by residents for a period of 60 days from the date of submission to the owner of the physical condition score for the property in which the residents reside.</P>
                <P>(3) The owner must post a notice to the residents in the owner's management office and on any bulletin boards in all common areas that advises residents of the availability of the materials described in paragraphs (g)(2) of this section. The notice should include the name, address and telephone number of the HUD Project Manager.</P>

                <P>(4) Residents are encouraged to comment on this information provided by <PRTPAGE P="47"/>the owners and submit any comments directly to the applicable Field Office. Should residents discover the owner provided HUD with a false certification during the review they are encouraged to notify the Hub or Program Center where appropriate inquiry and action will be taken.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Administrative review of properties.</E> The file of a multifamily property that receives a score of 30 points or less on its physical condition inspection will be referred to HUD's Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC) for evaluation. The files of any of the multifamily housing properties may be submitted to the DEC or to the appropriate HUD Multifamily Hub Director (MFD) for evaluation, or both, at the discretion of the Office of Housing.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Notification to owner of submission of property file to the MFD and DEC.</E> The Department will provide for notification to the owner that the file on the owner's property is being submitted to the MFD and/or the DEC for evaluation. The notification will be provided at the time the REAC issues the physical inspection report to the owner or at such other time as a referral occurs.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">30-Day period for owner to provide the DEC with supporting and relevant information and documentation.</E> The owner has 30 calendar days, from the date of the REAC notification to the owner, to provide comments, proposals, or any other information to the DEC which will assist the MFD and DEC in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the property. A proposal provided by an owner may include the owner's plan to correct deficiencies (corrective action plan). During the 30-day response time available to the owner, the DEC may encourage the owner to submit a corrective action plan. The corrective action plan, if timely submitted during the 30-day period (whether on the owner's initiative or at the request of the DEC), may serve as additional information for the DEC to consider in determining appropriate action to take at the conclusion of the evaluation period. If not submitted during the 30-day response time, a corrective action plan may be required of the owner at the conclusion of the DEC's evaluation of the property.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Evaluation of the property.</E> During the evaluation period, the DEC will perform an analysis of the multifamily housing property, which may include input from tenants, HUD multifamily officials, elected officials, and others as may be appropriate. Although the MFD will assist with the evaluation, for insured mortgages, the DEC will have primary responsibility for the conclusion of the evaluation of the property after taking into consideration the input of interested parties as described in this paragraph (h)(2). The DEC's evaluation may include a site visit to the owner's property.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Continuing responsibilities of HUD Multifamily Program Offices and Mortgagee.</E> During the period of DEC evaluation, HUD's multifamily program offices continue to be responsible for routine asset management tasks on properties and all servicing actions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> rent increase decisions, releases from reserve account approvals). In addition, during this period of evaluation, the mortgagee shall continue to carry out its duties and responsibilities with respect to the mortgage.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Enforcement action.</E> If, at the conclusion of the evaluation period, the DEC determines that enforcement action is appropriate, the DEC will provide notification to the owner of the DEC's decision to formally accept the property for enforcement purposes.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">DEC Owner Compliance Plan.</E> (i) After notification to the owner of the DEC's decision, the DEC will produce a proposed action plan (DEC Compliance Plan), the purpose of which is to improve the physical condition of the owner's property, and correct any other known violations by the owner of its legal obligations. The DEC Compliance Plan will describe:</P>
                <P>(A) The actions that will be required of the owner to correct, mitigate or eliminate identified property deficiencies, problems, hazards, and/or correct any other known violations by the owner;</P>
                <P>(B) The period of time within which these actions must be completed; and</P>
                <P>(C) The compliance responsibilities of the owner.</P>

                <P>(ii) The DEC Compliance Plan will be submitted to the MFD for review and <PRTPAGE P="48"/>concurrence. If the MFD does not concur, the DEC Compliance Plan will be submitted to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing and the Deputy Director of the DEC for review and concurrence. If the DEC Compliance Plan remains unapproved, a final decision on the plan will be made by HUD's Deputy Secretary in consultation with the General Counsel, the Assistant Secretary for Housing, and the Director of the DEC.</P>
                <P>(iii) Following submission of the DEC Compliance Plan to the owner, the owner will be provided a period of 30 calendar days to review and accept the DEC Compliance Plan. If the owner agrees to comply with the DEC Compliance Plan, the plan will be forwarded to the appropriate Multifamily Office for implementation and monitoring of completion of the plan's requirements.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Counter compliance plan proposal by owner.</E> The owner may submit an acceptable counter proposal to the DEC Compliance Plan. An owner's counter proposal to a DEC Compliance Plan must be submitted no later than the 30th day following submission of the DEC Compliance Plan to the owner. The DEC, in coordination with the MFD, may enter into discussions with the owner to achieve agreement to a revised DEC Compliance Plan. If the owner and the DEC agree on a revised DEC Compliance Plan, the revised plan will be forwarded to the appropriate Multifamily Office for implementation and monitoring of completion of the plan's requirements.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-cooperation and Non-compliance by owner.</E> If at the conclusion of the 30th calendar day following submission of the DEC Compliance Plan to the owner, the DEC receives no response from the owner, or the owner refuses to accept the DEC Compliance Plan, or to present a counter compliance plan proposal, or if the owner accepts the DEC Compliance Plan or revised DEC Compliance Plan, but refuses to take the actions required of the owner in the plan, the DEC may take appropriate enforcement action.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">No limitation on existing enforcement authority.</E> The administrative process provided in this section does not prohibit the Office of Housing, the DEC, or HUD generally, to take whatever action may be necessary when necessary (notwithstanding the commencement of this process), as authorized under existing statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents, to protect HUD's financial interests in multifamily properties and to protect the residents of these properties.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Limitations on material alteration of physical inspection software.</E> HUD will not materially alter the physical inspection requirements in a manner which would materially increase the cost of performing the inspection.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Construction standards.</E> Multifamily or care-type properties shall comply with the minimum property standards contained in the handbook identified in § 200.929(b)(2). In addition, each such property shall, for the Department's purposes, comply with:</P>
                <P>(1) The applicable State of local building code, if the property is located within a jurisdiction which has a building code accepted by the Secretary under § 200.925a(d); or</P>
                <P>(2)(i) The applicable State or local building code, and</P>

                <P>(ii) Those portions of the codes identified in § 200.295c which are designated <PRTPAGE P="49"/>by the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be located, if the property is located in a jurisdiction which has a building code partially accepted by the Secretary; or</P>
                <P>(3) The appropriate codes, as identified in § 200.925c(c), if the property is not located within a jurisdiction which has a building code accepted by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflicting standards.</E> The minimum property standards contained in the handbook identified in § 200.929(b)(2) do not preempt state or local standards, nor do they alter or affect a builder's obligation to comply with any state or local requirements. However, a property shall be eligible for benefits only if it complies with all applicable minimum property standards, including referenced standards.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Standard for evaluating local building codes.</E> The Secretary shall compare the portions of a local or State building code applicable to residential or institutional occupancy, as appropriate, submitted under § 200.925a(d) to the list of construction related areas contained in § 200.925b.</P>
                <P>(1) A State or local code will be accepted if it regulates each area on the list.</P>
                <P>(2) A State or local building code will be partially accepted if it regulates most of the areas on the list. However, no code may be partially accepted if it fails to regulate the subarea for seismic design (see § 200.925b(c)(5)), or if it fails to regulate subareas in more than one of the following major areas listed in § 200.925b: fire safety, light and ventilation, structural loads and seismic design, foundation systems, materials standards, construction components, glass, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and elevators.</P>
                <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph, a state or local code regulates an area if it establishes a standard concerning that area. However, for earthquake loads (see § 200.925b(c)(5)), ASCE 7-88 is mandatory.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Review process and acceptance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Jurisdictions without previously accepted building codes.</E> The following submission requirements apply to developers and other interested parties in jurisdictions without building codes, jurisdictions with building codes which have never been submitted for acceptance, and jurisdictions with building codes which have been submitted for acceptance and neither accepted nor partially accepted by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(i) Developers or other interested parties must comply with one of the following by the time of application for insurance or other benefits:</P>
                <P>(A) The developer or other interested party may choose to comply with the appropriate codes as identified in § 200.925c. If the developer or other interested party so chooses, then the multifamily or care-type property shall be constructed in accordance with one of the model codes designated in paragraph (c)(1), (2) or (3) of § 200.925c and with any other code or codes identified in the same paragraph. In such instances, the developer or other interested party shall notify the Department of the code or group of codes with which it intends to comply by the time of application for insurance or other benefits; or</P>
                <P>(B) The developer or other interested party may choose to comply with the State or local building code, if such code is acceptable to the Secretary. To obtain the Secretary's acceptance, the developer or other interested party shall submit the material specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section to the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed. Such material may be submitted at any time; provided, however, that it must be submitted no later than the time of application for mortgage insurance or other benefits.</P>
                <P>(ii) If, under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the developer or other interested party chooses to comply with the State or local building code as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it shall submit the following material to the HUD field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed:</P>
                <P>(A) A copy of the jurisdiction's building code, including all applicable service codes, appendices and referenced standards; and</P>

                <P>(B) A copy of the statute, ordinance, regulation, or order establishing the <PRTPAGE P="50"/>code, if such statute, ordinance, regulation or order is not contained in the building code itself.</P>
                <FP>However, the developer or other interested party need not submit any document already on file in the Field Office.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Jurisdictions with previously accepted or partially accepted building codes.</E> The following submission requirements apply to developers and other interested parties in any jurisdiction with a building code which has been accepted or partially accepted by the Secretary:</P>
                <P>(i) At the time of application for mortgage insurance or other benefits, the developer or other interested party shall submit to the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed.</P>
                <P>(A) A certificate stating that, since its acceptance by the Secretary, the jurisdiction's building code has not been changed; or</P>
                <P>(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) A copy of all changes to the jurisdiction's building code, including all applicable service codes and appendices, which have been made since the date of the code's acceptance by the Secretary. However, the developer or other interested party need not submit any part already in the possession of the Field Office; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A copy of the statute, ordinance regulation, or order making such changes in the code.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Notification of decision.</E> The Secretary shall review the material submitted under paragraphs (d) (1)(ii) and (2)(i). Following that review, the Secretary shall issue a written notice (except in the case of a previously accepted code which hasn't been changed) to the submitting party stating whether the State or local building code has been accepted, partially accepted, or whether the Secretary's previous acceptance or partial acceptance has been continued; the basis for the Secretary's decision; and a notification of the submitting party's right to present its views concerning the denial of acceptance if the code is neither accepted nor partially accepted. The Secretary may, in his discretion, permit either an oral or written presentation of views.</P>
                <P>(i) If a developer or other interested party is notified that a State or local building code has not been accepted, then the multifamily or care-type properties eligible for HUD benefits in that jurisdiction shall be constructed in accordance with the appropriate codes indicated in § 200.925c(c). In such instances, the developer or other interested party shall notify the HUD Field Office of the code or codes with which it chooses to comply, in accordance with § 200.925a(d)(1)(i)(A).</P>
                <P>(ii) If a developer or other interested party is notified that a State or local building code has been partially accepted, then the multifamily or care-type properties eligible for HUD benefits in that jurisdiction shall be constructed in accordance with the applicable State or local building code, plus those additional requirements identified in the written notice issued by the Secretary under § 200.925a(d)(3). The written notice shall identify, in accordance with appendix J of the Handbook identified in § 200.929(b)(2), those portions of the codes listed at § 200.925c(a) with which the property must comply.</P>
                <P>(iii) Each Regional Office will maintain a current list of jurisdictions with accepted building codes and a current list of jurisdictions with partially accepted building codes. The lists will state the most recent date of each code's acceptance or partial acceptance and will be available to any interested party upon request. In addition, the list of jurisdictions whose codes have been partially accepted shall identify those portions of the codes listed at § 200.925c(a) with which the property must comply.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Minimum property standards for one and two family dwellings.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Construction standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicable structures.</E> The standards identified or contained in this section, and in §§ 200.926a-200.926e, apply to single family detached homes, duplexes, three-unit homes, and to living units in a structure where the units are located side-by-side in town house fashion. Section 200.926d(c)(4) also applies to four-unit homes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicability of standards to new construction.</E> The standards referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable to structures which are:</P>

                <P>(i) Approved for insurance or other benefits prior to the start of construction, including approval under the Direct Endorsement process described in § 203.5 of this chapter, or under the Lender Insurance process described in § 203.6 of this chapter;<PRTPAGE P="53"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Approved for insurance or other benefits based upon participation in an insured warranty program; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Insured as new construction based upon a Certificate of Reasonable Value issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflicting standards.</E> The requirements contained in § 200.926d do not preempt local or State standards, nor do they alter or affect a builder's obligation to comply with any local or State requirements. However, a property shall be eligible for benefits only if it complies with the requirements of this subpart, including any referenced standards. When any of the requirements identified in § 200.926c are in conflict with a partially accepted local or state code, the conflict will be resolved by the HUD Field Office servicing the jurisdiction in which the property is to be located.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Standard for evaluating local or state building codes.</E> The Secretary shall compare a local building code submitted under paragraph (d) of this section or a State code to the list of construction related areas contained in § 200.926a.</P>
                <P>(1) A local or State code will be accepted if it regulates each area and subarea on the list.</P>
                <P>(2) A State or local building code will be partially accepted if it regulates most of the areas on the list. However, no code may be partially accepted if it fails to regulate the subarea for seismic design (see § 200.926a(c)(5)), or if it fails to regulate subareas in more than one of the following major areas listed in § 200.926a: fire safety, light and ventilation, structural loads and seismic design, foundation systems, materials standards, construction components, glass, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical.</P>
                <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph, a local or State code regulates an area or subarea if it establishes a standard concerning that area or subarea. However, for earthquake loads (see § 200.926a(c)(5)), ASCE 7-88 is mandatory.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Code selection.</E> Any materials required to be submitted under this section must be submitted by the time the lender or other interested party applies for mortgage insurance or other benefits.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Jurisdictions without previously accepted building codes.</E> The following submission requirements apply to lenders and other interested parties in jurisdictions without building codes, jurisdictions with building codes which have never been submitted for acceptance, and jurisdictions with building codes which previously have been submitted for acceptance and have not been accepted or partially accepted by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(i) In jurisdictions without local building codes:</P>
                <P>(A) If the State building code is acceptable, the lender or other interested party must comply with the State building code and the requirements of § 200.926d;</P>
                <P>(B) If the State building code is partially acceptable, the lender or other interested party must comply with:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The acceptable portions of the partially acceptable code; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Those portions of the CABO One and Two Family Dwelling Code designated by the HUD Field Office in accordance with § 200.926c; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The requirements of § 200.926d.</P>
                <P>(C) If there is no State building code or if the State building code is unacceptable, the lender or other interested party must comply with:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The CABO One and Two Family Dwelling Code as identified in § 200.926b(a); and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The requirements of § 200.926d.</P>
                <P>(ii) In jurisdictions with local building codes which have never been submitted for review, lenders or other interested parties must:</P>
                <P>(A) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) (A), (B) or (C) of this section, as appropriate; or</P>
                <P>(B) Request the Secretary's acceptance of the local building code in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the Secretary determines that the local building code is unacceptable, then the lender or other interested party must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) (A), (B) or (C) of this section as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the Secretary determines that the local code is partially acceptable, <PRTPAGE P="54"/>then the lender or other interested party must comply with:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The acceptable portions of the partially acceptable local code; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Those portions of the CABO One and Two Family Dwelling Code designated by the HUD Field Office in accordance with § 200.926c; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The requirements of § 200.926d.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If the Secretary determines that the local code is acceptable, then the lender or other interested party must comply with the local building code and the requirements of § 200.926d.</P>
                <P>(iii) In jurisdictions with local building codes which previously have been submitted for review and which have been found unacceptable by the Secretary:</P>
                <P>(A) If the local code has not been changed since the date the code or changes thereto were submitted to the Secretary, the lender or other interested party must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) (A), (B) or (C) of this section, as appropriate; or</P>

                <P>(B) If the local code has been changed since the date when the code or changes thereto were submitted to the Secretary, the lender or other interested party must submit a copy of all changes to the local building code, including all applicable service codes and appendices and a copy of the statute, ordinance, regulation or order making such changes in the code, which have been made since the date when the code or other changes thereto were last submitted to the Secretary. However, the lender or other interested party need not submit any part already in the possession of the HUD Field Office. Based upon the Secretary's determination concerning the acceptability of the local code as changed, the lender or other interested party must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) (<E T="03">1</E>), (<E T="03">2</E>) or (<E T="03">3</E>) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(iv) In order to obtain the Department's approval of a local code, the lender or other interested party must submit the following material to the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed:</P>
                <P>(A) A copy of the jurisdiction's local building code, including all applicable service codes and appendices; and</P>
                <P>(B) A copy of the statute, ordinance, regulation, or order establishing the code, if such statute, ordinance, regulation or order is not contained in the building code itself.</P>
                <FP>However, the lender or other interested party need not submit any document already on file in the HUD Field Office.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Jurisdictions with previously accepted or partially accepted building codes.</E> The following submission requirements apply to lenders or other interested parties in any jurisdiction with a building code which has been accepted or partially accepted by the Secretary:</P>
                <P>(i) The lender or other interested party shall submit to the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed:</P>
                <P>(A) A certificate stating that, since the date when the code or any changes thereto were last submitted to the Secretary, the jurisdiction's local building code has not been changed; or</P>
                <P>(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) A copy of all changes to the jurisdiction's building code, including all applicable service codes and appendices, which have been made since the date when the code or other changes thereto were last submitted to the Secretary. However, the lender or other interested party need not submit any part already in the possession of the HUD Field Office; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A copy of the statute, ordinance, regulation, or order making such changes in the code.</P>
                <P>(ii) If, based upon changes to the local building code, the Secretary determines that it is unacceptable, the lender or other interested party must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) (i)(A), (B) or (C) of this section, as appropriate.</P>

                <P>(iii) If the local building code was previously found by the Secretary to be partially acceptable and there have been no changes to it or if the local building code was previously found by the Secretary to be partially acceptable and if, based upon changes to it, the Secretary determines that it is still partially acceptable or if the local building code was previously found by the Secretary to be acceptable and if, based upon changes to it, the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="55"/>determines that it is partially acceptable, then the lender or other interested party must comply with paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) (<E T="03">i</E>), (<E T="03">ii</E>) and (<E T="03">iii</E>) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iv) If the local building code was previously found by the Secretary to be partially acceptable and if, based upon changes to it, the Secretary determines that it is acceptable, or if the local building code was previously found by the Secretary to be acceptable and there have been no changes to the code, or if the local building code was previously found by the Secretary to be acceptable and if, based upon changes to it, the Secretary determines that it is still acceptable, then the lender or other interested party must comply with the local building code and the requirements of § 200.926d.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Notification of decision.</E> (i) Fire retardant treated plywood, where approved by a State or local building code, shall not be permitted for use in roof construction unless a HUD technical suitability bulletin has been issued by the Department for that product.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Secretary shall review the material submitted under § 200.926(d). Following that review, the Secretary shall issue a written notice (except where there is a previously accepted or partially accepted code which has not been changed) to the submitting party stating whether the local building code is acceptable, partially acceptable, or not acceptable. Where the local building code is not acceptable, the notice shall also state whether the State code is acceptable, partially acceptable or not acceptable. The notice shall also contain the basis for the Secretary's decision and a notification of the submitting party's right to present its views concerning the denial of acceptance if the code is neither accepted nor partially accepted. The Secretary may, in his or her discretion, permit either an oral or written presentation of views.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Department's responsibilities.</E> (i) Each Regional and Field Office will maintain a current list of jurisdictions with accepted local or State building codes, a current list of jurisdictions with partially accepted local or State building codes and a current list of jurisdictions with local or State building codes which have not been accepted. For local codes, the lists will state the most recent date when the code or changes thereto were submitted to the Secretary. The lists, which shall be prepared by the Field Offices and submitted to the Regional Offices, will be available to any interested party upon request. In addition, the list of jurisdictions whose codes have been partially accepted shall identify in accordance with § 200.926c those portions of the codes listed at § 200.926b(a) with which the property must comply.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Department is responsible for obtaining copies of the State codes and any changes thereto.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Application</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> These standards cover the agency requirements for accessibility to physically handicapped people, variations to standards, real estate entity, trespass and utilities, site conditions, access, site design, streets, dedication of utilities, drainage and flood hazard exposure, special construction and product acceptance, thermal requirements, and water supply systems.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Requirements for accessibility to physically handicapped people.</E> The HUD Field Office will advise project sponsors as to the extent accessibility will be required for new construction of one- and two-family dwellings on a project-by-project basis.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Technical standards. See</E> HUD Handbook, 4910.1, Sections 100-1.3b and 100-1.3c.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Variations to standards</E>—(i) <E T="03">New materials and technologies. See</E> paragraph (d) of this section. Alternatives, nonconventional or innovative methods and materials shall be equivalent to these standards in the areas of structural soundness, durability, economy of maintenance or operation and usability.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Variation procedures.</E> Variations from the requirements of any standard with which the Department requires compliance shall be made in the following ways:</P>
                <P>(A) For a particular design or construction method to be used on a single case or project, the decision is the responsibility of the Field Office. Headquarters concurrence is not required.</P>
                <P>(B) Where a variation is intended to be on a repetitive basis, a recommendation for a Local Acceptable Standard, substantiating data, and background information shall be submitted by the Field Office to the Director, Office of Manufactured Housing and Regulatory Functions.</P>
                <P>(iii) Variances which require individual analysis and decision in each instance are not considered as repetitive variances even though one particular standard is repeatedly the subject of variation. Such variances are covered by paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">General acceptability criteria</E>—(1) <E T="03">Real estate entity.</E> The property shall comprise a single plot except that a primary plot with a secondary plot for an appurtenant garage or for other use contributing to the marketability of the property will be acceptable provided the two plots are in such proximity as to comprise a readily marketable real estate entity.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Service and facilities</E>—(i) <E T="03">Trespass.</E> Each living unit shall be one that can be used and maintained individually without trespass upon adjoining properties, except when the windowless wall of a detached dwelling is located on a side lot line. A detached dwelling may be located on a side lot line if:</P>
                <P>(A) legal provision is made for permanent access for the maintenance of the exterior portion of the lot line wall, and</P>

                <P>(B) the minimum distances from the dwelling to the dwellings on the abutting properties are not less than the sum of the side yard distances computed as appropriate for the type of opposing walls. (minimum distance 10 ft).<PRTPAGE P="58"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Utilities.</E> Utility services shall be independent for each living unit, except that common services such as water, sewer, gas and electricity may be provided for living units under a single mortgage or ownership. Separate utility service shut-off for each unit shall be provided. For living units under separate ownership, common utility services may be provided from the main to the building line when protected by an easement or convenant and maintenance agreement acceptable to HUD, but shall not pass over, under or through any other living unit. Individual utilities serving a living unit may not pass over, under or through another living unit under the same mortgage unless provision is made for repair and maintenance of utilities without trespass or when protected by an easement or covenant providing permanent access for maintenance and repair of the utilities. Building drain cleanouts shall be accessible from the exterior where a single drain line within the building serves more than one unit.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Site conditions.</E> (i) The property shall be free of those foreseeable hazards and adverse conditions which may affect the health and safety of occupants or the structural soundness of the improvements, or which may impair the customary use and enjoyment of the property. The hazards include toxic chemicals, radioactive materials, other pollution, hazardous activities, potential damage from soil or other differential ground movements, ground water, inadequate surface drainage, flood, erosion, or other hazards located on or off site. The site must meet the standards set forth in 24 CFR part 51, and HUD Handbook 4910.1, section 606 for termite and decay protection.</P>
                <P>(ii) When special conditions exist or arise during construction which were unforeseen and which necessitate precautionary or hazard mitigation measures, the HUD Field Office shall require corrective work to mitigate potential adverse effects from the special conditions as necessary. Special conditions include rock formations, unstable soils or slopes, high ground water levels, springs, or other conditions which may adversely affect a property. It shall be the builder's responsibility to ensure proper design, construction and satisfactory performance where these conditions are present.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Access.</E> (i) Each property shall be provided with vehicular or pedestrian access by a public or private street. Private streets shall be protected by permanent easement.</P>
                <P>(ii) Each living unit shall have a means of access such that it is unnecessary to pass through any other living unit.</P>
                <P>(iii) The rear yard shall be accessible without passing through any other living unit.</P>
                <P>(iv) For a townhouse type dwelling, access to the rear yard may be by means of alley, easement, passage through the dwelling, or other means acceptable to the HUD Field Office.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Site design</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) A site design shall be provided which includes an arrangement of all site facilities necessary to create a safe, functional, healthful, durable and energy efficient living environment.</P>
                <P>(ii) With the exception of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, these site design standards apply only in communities that have not adopted criteria for site development applicable to one and two family dwellings.</P>
                <P>(iii) Single family detached houses situated on individual lots located on existing streets with utilities need not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Streets.</E> (i) Existing or proposed streets on the site shall connect to private or public streets and shall provide all-weather access to all buildings for essential and emergency use, including access needed for deliveries, service, maintenance and fire equipment.</P>
                <P>(ii) Streets shall be designed for dedication for public use and maintenance or, when approved by the HUD Field Office, may be retained as private streets where protected by permanent easements.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Dedication.</E> Utilities shall be located to permit dedication to the local government or appropriate public body.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Drainage and flood hazard exposure</E>—(i) <E T="03">Residential structures with basements located in FEMA-designated areas of special flood hazard.</E> The elevation of the lowest floor in structures with basements shall be at or above the base <PRTPAGE P="59"/>flood level (100-year flood level) required for new construction or substantial improvement of residential structures under regulations for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) (see 44 CFR 60.3 through 60.6), except where variances from this standard are granted by communities under the procedures of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) at 44 CFR 60.6(a) or exceptions from this NFIP standard for basements are approved by FEMA in accordance with procedures at 44 CFR 60.6(c).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Residential structures without basements located in FEMA-designated areas of special flood hazard.</E> The elevation of the lowest floor in structures without basements shall be at or above the FEMA-designated base flood elevation (100-year flood level).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Residential structures located in FEMA-designated “coastal high hazard areas”.</E> (A) Basements or any permanent enclosure of space below the lowest floor of a structure are prohibited.</P>
                <P>(B) Where FEMA has determined the base flood level without establishing stillwater elevations, the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) and its horizontal supports shall be at or above the base flood level.</P>
                <P>(iv)(A) In all cases in which a Direct Endorsement (DE) mortgagee or a Lender Insurance (LI) mortgagee seek to insure a mortgage on a newly constructed one-to four-family dwelling (including a newly erected manufactured home) that was processed by the DE or LI mortgagee, the DE or LI mortgagee must determine whether the property improvements (dwelling and related structures/equipment essential to the value of the property and subject to flood damage) are located in a 100-year floodplain, as designated on maps of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. If so, the DE mortgagee, before submitting the application for insurance to HUD, or the LI mortgagee, before submitting all the required data regarding the mortgage to HUD, must obtain:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A final Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA);</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR); or</P>

They are intended to <PRTPAGE P="63"/>provide a sound basis for determining the acceptability of housing built under the HUD mortgage insurance and low-rent public housing programs. The Minimum Property Standards refer to material standards developed by industry and accepted by HUD. In addition, under Section 521 of the National Housing Act, HUD adopts its own technical suitability standards for materials and products for which there are no industry standards acceptable to HUD. These standards are contained in Use of Materials Bulletins that apply to products and methods and Materials Releases that apply to specific materials. Use of Materials Bulletins and Materials Releases are addenda to the Minimum Property Standards. Unless otherwise stated, the current edition, issue, or version of each of these documents, as available from its source, is applicable to this subpart S.

The manufacturer shall notify the administrator if a retest if requested. If a retest is not requested, validation shall be withdrawn. If the manufacturer requests a retest, the administrator shall select new samples and submit them to the same or another laboratory at the manufacturer's expense, for retest of only the test requirement(s) in which the failure(s) occurred. If the specified number of specimens pass the retest, the product can continue to be validated and listed. If the designated number of specimens described in the UM Bulletin fail, the administrator shall decertify the product. The manufacturer may request that a new selection be made of the product after corredction or modifications and be subjected to the initial acceptance testing procedure or to a program of retesting established by the administrator. The administrator may decertify the product on the basis of inadequate quality control by the manufacturer. The administrator shall notify the manufacturer, HUD headquarters and the HUD Field Offices of any decertification within 7 days. When the product is decertified the magnufacturer shall remove labels, tags or marks from all production and inventory in his/her control determined to be in noncompliance.</P>

Submission shall be made to the administrator that validated the manufacturer's product. The administrator shall notify the manufacturer that its product has been challenged and shall make arrangements to obtain test samples of the challenged product. An estimate of the cost of the special sample selection and testing shall be made to the complainant. The complainant shall pay the estimated cost of the investigation in advance of any testing of the challenged product, unless HUD believes the complaint to be in the public's interest. HUD may conduct its own investigation when deemed necessary based upon a complaint or a product failure. The administrator shall submit the sample of the challenged product to an approved laboratory of the administrator's choice with the request to test compliance of only the challenged requirement(s). If the samples tested prove that the product failed to meet the standard, the product shall be decertified immediately. The manufacturer whose product is decertified shall reimburse the administrator for all <PRTPAGE P="69"/>costs of the investigation and the administrator shall refund the complainant's advance payment. If the tests prove that the product does comply with the standard, the complainant shall be notified that the tests do not support the complaint and that the advance fee has been used for the cost of testing and investigating the claim.</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Maintainance of the program.</E> Each administrator shall maintain the program in conformance with administrative letters issued by HUD for the purpose of clarifying procedures and interpreting the applicable standard. These letters may also be used to revise and amend the procedures used in specific programs. Significant changes in any program shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> HUD may issue a warning letter, which specifies problems or violations identified by HUD, to a MAP lender.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of warning letter.</E> The warning letter:</P>
                <P>(1) Does not suspend a lender's MAP privileges;</P>
                <P>(2) May impose a higher level of review of the lender's underwriting by HUD;</P>

                <P>(4) May require a meeting in a designated HUD office with the principal owners or officers, or both, of the MAP lender to discuss the specified problems and violations, and possible corrective actions.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Only the MAP Lender Review Board (or Board) may place a lender on probation, in accordance with the procedures of § 200.1535.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of probation.</E> (1) Probation is intended to be corrective in nature and not punitive. As a result, release from probation is conditioned upon the lender meeting a specific requirement or requirements, such as replacement of a staff member. A lender's failure to take prompt corrective action after being placed on probation may be the basis for a recommendation of either suspension or termination. Any such recommendation shall, when possible, go to a MAP Lender Review Board composed of the same members who issued the original probation.</P>
                <P>(2) During the probation period, a MAP lender:</P>
                <P>(i) Shall be removed from the MAP-Approved Lender list posted on HUD's website;</P>
                <P>(ii) May not submit, and HUD may not accept, materials after the close of business of the date of the probation letter for a new application under MAP for multifamily mortgage insurance from HUD; and</P>

                <P>(iii) May continue to process any existing application for multifamily mortgage insurance submitted to a <PRTPAGE P="84"/>Multifamily Hub or Program Center before the date of the probation letter.</P>
                <P>(3) The MAP Lender Review Board may impose a higher level of review of the lender's underwriting by HUD;</P>
                <P>(4) Probation is nationwide in effect.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Duration of probation.</E> (1) Probation continues until all specific corrective actions required by the MAP Lender Review Board (for example, exclusion of a specific staff member from work on MAP loans) are taken by the MAP lender. When all corrective actions have been taken, the MAP lender shall notify the Board. Once the Board is satisfied that the corrective actions have occurred, the probation period shall end.</P>
                <P>(2) A false statement that corrective action has been taken constitutes a false certification and may constitute a violation of 18 US.C. 1001.</P>
                <P>(3) When probation is lifted, the lender's name shall be promptly reinstated on the MAP-Approved Lender list posted on HUD's Web site.</P>

                <P>(3) Any MAP pre-application or MAP application in process may no longer be processed under MAP by the terminated lender. The lender will either:</P>

                <P>(i) Immediately transfer the transaction to the traditional application processing (TAP) procedure. HUD will completely reprocess all stages of the transaction; or<PRTPAGE P="85"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Immediately transfer the project to a new MAP lender. The new MAP lender must completely reprocess all stages of the transaction. At no time can the new MAP lender assign the pre-application, the firm application, the mortgage insurance commitment, or the insured construction loan back to the original MAP lender.</P>
                <P>(4) HUD will not endorse any MAP loan processed by the terminated lender unless a firm commitment was issued before the date of termination.</P>
                <P>(i) Firm commitments involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation must be immediately transferred to a new MAP lender. At no time can the new MAP lender assign the firm mortgage insurance commitment, or the insured construction loan, back to the original MAP lender.</P>
                <P>(ii) Firm commitments issued for Section 223(f) projects may be transferred before final endorsement to any approved FHA lender or kept in the lender's portfolio.</P>
                <P>(iii) For those construction loans that have been initially endorsed, the MAP lender will lose its MAP privileges for construction loan administration. HUD will assume all the construction loan administration duties it normally performs for TAP processing.</P>
                <P>(iv) The original lender may service a transferred loan once it is finally endorsed.</P>
                <P>(5) Termination is nationwide in effect.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Bases for sanctioning a MAP lender.</SUBJECT>
                <P>It is HUD policy that approved MAP lenders are expected to comply at all times with HUD's underwriting and construction loan administration requirements and not to take any action that presents a risk to HUD's insurance funds. A MAP lender's improper underwriting and construction loan administration activities may lead to a warning letter or other sanction from HUD. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Minor offenses that may be the basis for a warning letter include:</E>
                </P>

                <P>(1) Failure to provide required exhibits or the submission of incomplete or inaccurate exhibits. Although the MAP lender will be permitted to correct minor errors or provide additional information, substantial inaccuracies or <PRTPAGE P="86"/>lack of significant information will result in a return of the application and retention of any fee collected;</P>
                <P>(2) Repeated failure to complete processing to firm commitment unrelated to an underwriting analysis that demonstrates that the process should not proceed to firm commitment;</P>
                <P>(3) Preparation of an underwriting summary that is not supported by the appropriate documentation and analysis;</P>
                <P>(4) Failure to notify the HUD processing office promptly of changes in the mortgage loan application for a firm commitment submitted, such as changes in rents, numbers of units, or gross project area;</P>
                <P>(5) Failure to meet MAP closing requirements or construction loan administration requirements;</P>
                <P>(6) Business practices that do not conform to those generally accepted by prudent lenders or that show irresponsibility; and</P>
                <P>(7) Failure to cooperate with a Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division review by HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Serious offenses that might be a basis for a warning letter or probation, suspension, or termination include:</E>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Receipt of multiple warning letters over any one-year period. In determining which sanction to pursue as a result of prior warning letters, HUD will consider the facts and circumstances surrounding those warning letters and the corrective actions, if any, undertaken by the lender;</P>
                <P>(2) Fraud or material misrepresentation in the lender's participation in FHA multifamily programs;</P>
                <P>(3) Lender collusion with, or influence upon, third party contractors to modify reports affecting the contractor's independent evaluation;</P>
                <P>(4) A violation of MAP procedures by a third party contractor, which the MAP lender knew, or should have known, was occurring and which, if performed by the MAP lender itself, would constitute a ground for a sanction under this chapter;</P>
                <P>(5) Evidence that a lender's inadequate or inaccurate underwriting was a cause for assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage and claim for insurance benefits to HUD;</P>
                <P>(6) Identity-of-interest violations as defined by Chapter 2 of the MAP Guide;</P>
                <P>(7) Payment by, or receipt of a payment by, a MAP lender of any kickback or other consideration, directly or indirectly, which would affect the lender's independent evaluation, or represent a conflict of interest, in connection with any FHA-insured mortgage transaction;</P>
                <P>(8) Failure to comply with any agreement, certification, undertaking, or condition of approval listed in a MAP lender's application for approval;</P>
                <P>(9) Noncompliance with any requirement or directive of the MAP Lender Review Board;</P>
                <P>(10) Violation of the requirements of any contract with HUD, or violation of the requirements in any statute or regulation;</P>
                <P>(11) Submission of false information, or a false certification, to HUD in connection with any MAP mortgage transaction;</P>
                <P>(12) Failure of a MAP lender to respond in a timely manner to inquiries from the MAP Lender Review Board in accordance with this subpart;</P>
                <P>(13) Indictment or conviction of a MAP lender or any of its officers, directors, principals, or employees for an offense that reflects on the responsibility, integrity, or ability of the lender to participate in the MAP initiative;</P>
                <P>(14) Employing or retaining an officer, partner, director, or principal at the time when the person was suspended, debarred, ineligible, or subject to an LDP under 2 CFR part 2424, or otherwise prohibited from participation in HUD programs, when the MAP lender knew or should have known of the prohibition;</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

                <P>These regulations implement the provisions of section 2 of title I of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1703). They contain the requirements under which an approved financial institution may obtain insurance on loans made for the alteration, repair or improvement of property, for the purchase of a manufactured home and/or the lot on which to place such home, for the purchase and installation of fire safety equipment in existing health care facilities, and for the preservation of historic structures. The insurance granted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be available only for loans involving property located within a State, as that term is defined in § 201.2. The insurance can cover up to 10 percent of the amount of all insured Title I loans in the financial institution's portfolio, as reflected in the <PRTPAGE P="96"/>total amount of insurance coverage contained at any time in an insurance coverage reserve account established by the Secretary, less amounts for insurance claims paid. As limited by the amount of insurance coverage in such a reserve account, the insurance can cover up to 90 percent of the loss of any individual loan.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>As used in the regulations in this part the term:</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Act</E> means the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1703.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Actuarial method</E> means the method of allocating payments made on a loan between the outstanding balance of the principal amount borrowed and the interest due on a loan obligation, under which a payment is applied first to the accrued interest, and any remainder is subtracted from, or any deficiency is added to, the unpaid balance of the obligation.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Borrower</E> means one who applies for and receives a loan insured under this part. The term may also include any co-maker or co-signer or any assumptor who is obligated for the repayment of a loan obligation insured under this part.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Combination loan</E> means a loan made for the purchase or refinancing in a single transaction of a manufactured home and a manufactured home lot, and may also include a garage, patio, carport, or other comparable appurtenance.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Dealer</E> means, in the case of property improvement loans, a seller, contractor, or supplier of goods or services. In the case of manufactured home loans, <E T="03">dealer</E> means one who engages in the business of manufactured home retail sales.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Dealer loan</E> means a loan where a dealer, having a direct or indirect financial interest in the transaction between the borrower and the lender, assists the borrower in preparing the credit application or otherwise assists the borrower in obtaining the loan from the lender. In the case of a property improvement loan, the lender may disburse the loan proceeds solely to the borrower, or jointly to the borrower and the dealer or other parties to the transaction. In the case of a manufactured home loan, the lender may disburse the loan proceeds solely to the dealer or the borrower, or jointly to the borrower and the dealer or other parties to the transaction.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Debtor</E> means the borrower, any co-maker or co-signer, and any assumptor who is liable for the repayment of a defaulted loan obligation insured under this part.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Default</E> means a failure by the borrower to make any payment due under the note, when such failure continues for a period of 30 days. For the purpose of these regulations, the “date of default” shall be considered as 30 days after the first failure to make an installment payment on the note which is not covered by subsequent payments, when applied to the overdue installments in the order in which they became due.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Direct loan</E> means a loan for which a borrower makes application directly to a lender without any assistance from a dealer. The credit application, signed by the borrower, may be filled out by the borrower or by a person acting at the direction of the borrower who does not have a financial interest in the loan transaction. The lender may disburse the loan proceeds solely to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and other parties to the transaction. If a dealer takes legal action required by State law in order for the lender to obtain a valid and enforceable lien against the property, such action by the dealer will not convert an otherwise direct loan to a dealer loan.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Discount points</E> means a fee charged by the lender, separate from interest but part of the total finance charges on the loan, that is part of the lender's total yield on the loan needed to maintain a competitive position with other types of investments. One discount point equals one percent of the principal amount of the loan. As discount points on the loan increase, the interest rate can be expected to decrease in a fairly consistent relationship.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Existing structure</E> means a dwelling, including a manufactured home, that was completed and occupied at least 90 days prior to an application for a Title I loan, or a nonresidential structure <PRTPAGE P="97"/>that was a completed building with a distinctive functional use prior to an application for a Title I loan.

                <P>(2) Residential structures which have been damaged by conditions determined by the President to warrant relief under the provisions of title 42, chapter 68, of the United States Code.</P>

                <P>(2) Large appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, ranges, dishwashers, clothes washers or clothes dryers.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Borrower eligibility.</E> To be eligible for a manufactured home loan (whether a manufactured home purchase loan, a manufactured home lot loan, or a combination loan), the borrower must become the owner of the particular property which is to be financed with such a loan. Where the loan involves a manufactured home which is classified as realty, ownership of the home must be in fee simple. Where the loan involves a manufactured home lot, ownership of the lot must be in fee simple, except where the lot consists of a share in a cooperative association which owns and operates a manufactured home park.<PRTPAGE P="108"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible use of loan proceeds.</E> (1) The loan proceeds may be used for the purchase or refinancing of a manufactured home, a suitably developed lot on which to place a manufactured home already owned by the borrower, or a manufactured home and a suitably developed lot for the home in combination. The loan proceeds may also be used to refinance an existing manufactured home already owned by the borrower in connection with the purchase of a manufactured home lot, or to refinance a lot already owned by the borrower in connection with the purchase of a manufactured home. Where the proceeds are for a manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan, the home must be the borrower's principal residence. Where the proceeds are for a manufactured home lot loan, the borrower's manufactured home must be placed on the lot and occupied as the borrower's principal residence within six months after the date of the loan.</P>

                <P>(i) A new home, which is one that is purchased by the borrower within 18 months after the date of manufacture and has not been previously occupied; or</P>
                <P>(ii) An existing home, which is one that does not meet the criteria for a new home. In order to be eligible for financing with an insured loan under this part, the manufactured home, its warranty and the site on which the home is placed must meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) The proceeds of a loan to purchase a new manufactured home or a new manufactured home and lot shall not be used to purchase furniture or wheels and axles, and the cost of these items shall not be included in the total principal obligation calculated under § 201.10 (b)(1) or (d)(1).</P>
                <P>(4) The proceeds of a manufactured home purchase loan may be used for the purchase, construction or installation of a garage, carport, patio or other comparable appurtenance to the manufactured home, as stated in the retail purchase contract and as approved by the Secretary. The proceeds of a combination loan may be used for the purchase, construction or installation of a permanent foundation, garage, carport, patio or other comparable appurtenance to the manufactured home.</P>
                <P>(5) The Secretary will establish a list of items and activities that may not be financed with the proceeds of any manufactured home loan. If a lender has any doubt as to the eligibility of any item or activity, it shall request a specific ruling by the Secretary before making a loan.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Construction, transportation and installation requirements.</E> (1) The manufactured home shall be certified by the manufacturer under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation to have been constructed in compliance with the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5401-5426, so as to conform to all applicable Federal construction and safety standards, as evidenced by a label or tag affixed to the manufactured home in accordance with 24 CFR 3280.8.</P>
                <P>(2) During any period of transportation from the factory to the borrower's homesite, the structural integrity of the manufactured home shall be maintained so that it will be livable and durable.</P>
                <P>(3) The installation or erection of the manufactured home on the homesite shall comply with the manufacturer's requirements for anchoring, support, stability and maintenance. Any permanent foundation shall be constructed in accordance with the current edition of HUD's Permanent Foundations Guide for Manufactured Housing (HUD Handbook 4930.3).</P>
                <P>(4) For any manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan involving a sale of the manufactured home by a dealer, the dealer shall inspect the manufactured home, as installed or erected on the homesite, for structural damage or other defects resulting from the transportation and installation of the home. The dealer shall also test the performance of the home's plumbing, mechanical and electrical systems to assure that they are fully operational.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Manufacturer's warranty requirements.</E> (1) To induce the Secretary to insure a title I loan under this part for the purchase of a new manufactured <PRTPAGE P="109"/>home and to induce a borrower to purchase such a home, the home manufacturer shall furnish the borrower with a written warranty, duly executed by an authorized representative of the manufacturer on a HUD-approved form. The warranty shall be provided without cost to the borrower. The effective date of the warranty shall be the date of delivery of the manufactured home to the borrower, regardless of when the warranty was executed by the manufacturer or was delivered to the borrower.</P>
                <P>(2) The warranty shall obligate the home manufacturer to take appropriate action to correct any nonconformity with the standards prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or any defects in materials or workmanship which become evident within one year after the date of delivery. This warranty shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, all other rights and privileges which the borrower may have under any other law or instrument during such period or thereafter. A copy of the warranty shall be retained in the lender's loan file.</P>
                <P>(3) Prior to making a loan involving a new manufactured home, the lender shall investigate whether the home manufacturer is substantially complying with its warranty obligations on other homes financed by the lender under any program. If the lender knows, because of consumer complaints, dealer comments or other information concerning the manufacturer received in the course of business, that consumers have complained about warranty performance, the lender shall ascertain whether such complaints have been resolved. The lender's findings shall be documented in the loan file. Such documentation may reference information or materials contained in other files of the lender, provided that the file contains a written certification signed by a responsible loan officer under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation that the lender's findings are supported by such other information or materials.</P>
                <P>(4) If the lender concludes under paragraph (d)(3) of this section that a manufacturer may not be honoring its warranties, the lender shall immediately notify the Secretary in writing, with documentation of the facts and circumstances.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Manufactured homesite standards.</E> (1) To assure the suitability of the homesite, the manufactured home shall be placed on a leased site in a manufactured home park or on an individual manufactured home lot or other site owned or leased by the borrower that meets the following standards. A manufactured home may be placed on a site within Indian trust or otherwise restricted lands if the borrower owns or leases the site, or if the borrower obtains written permission acceptable to the Secretary from the trustee or the tribal authority who controls the use of the site.</P>
                <P>(2) The manufactured homesite shall be served by adequate public or community water and sewerage systems, unless appropriate local officials certify that either or both such systems are unavailable to provide an adequate level of service to the manufactured homesite. If either or both such systems are not available, the manufactured homesite shall comply with local or State minimum lot area requirements for the provision of onsite water supply and/or sewage disposal.</P>
                <P>(3) When the manufactured home is to be placed on a leased site in a manufactured home park, the lender shall obtain certifications from the appropriate State or local government officials that the park complies with minimum standards relating to vehicular access, water supply, sewage disposal, utility connections, and other aspects of park development. Where minimum State and local standards for park development are not established or enforced, the lender shall obtain a certification from a registered civil engineer that the park meets minimum standards for park development prescribed by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(4) When the manufactured home is to be placed on an individual manufactured home lot or other site owned or leased by the borrower (or on an Indian land site under paragraph (e)(1) of this section), the lender shall obtain certifications from the appropriate local government officials that:</P>

                <P>(i) The site complies with local zoning ordinances and regulations, if any;<PRTPAGE P="110"/>

                <P>(3) The lender shall conduct a credit investigation based on the credit application, and shall obtain written verification of or otherwise document the current employment and current income of the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer. If the borrower or any co-maker or co-signer has changed employment within the past two years, the lender shall obtain written verification of or otherwise document the person's prior employment and prior income during the two-year period. If the borrower or any co-maker or co-signer was self-employed during any period of the previous two years, the lender shall obtain documentation of the person's income during such period of self-employment.</P>
                <P>(4) The lender shall also determine the total amount of the borrower's existing and proposed title I loans to ensure that the loan amounts in § 201.10 are not exceeded.</P>
                <P>(5) As part of its credit investigation, the lender shall obtain a consumer credit report stating the credit accounts and payment history of the borrower and of any co-maker or co-signer. Subject to state or local law, the lender shall check with the inquirers concerning all credit inquiries reported within the previous 90 days to determine whether the borrower or the co-maker or co-signer has incurred debts not listed on the credit application. If a consumer credit report is not available or is incomplete, the loan file shall contain other documentation of the lender's diligent investigation of the credit of the borrower or of the co-maker or co-signer.</P>
                <P>(6) If the consumer credit report does not contain the necessary information, the lender shall obtain written verification that the borrower is not over 30 days delinquent on any senior mortgages or deeds of trust on the property being improved with a property improvement loan.</P>
                <P>(7) The lender shall verify, in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe, whether the borrower is in default or a claim has been paid in connection with any loan obligation owed to or insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government.</P>
                <P>(8) For any loan with a total principal balance in excess of $5,000, the lender shall obtain written verification of the source of all funds of the borrower required for the borrower's initial payment, if such payment will be in excess of five percent of the loan.</P>

                <P>(9) Before making a final determination on the creditworthiness of the borrower, the lender shall conduct a face-to-face or telephone interview with the <PRTPAGE P="111"/>borrower and any co-maker or co-signer to resolve any discrepancies in the information on the credit application and to assure that the information is accurate and complete.</P>
                <P>(10) After a thorough credit investigation and in the absence of information to the contrary, the lender may rely upon all statements of fact made by the borrower or any co-maker or co-signer in a credit application.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Income requirements.</E> (1) For any Title I loan, the credit application and review must establish that the borrower's income will be adequate to meet the periodic payments required by the loan, as well as the borrower's other housing expenses and recurring charges. For a borrower's income to be considered adequate, housing expenses and total fixed expenses generally may not exceed maximum percentages of effective gross income established by the Secretary. If these expense-to-income ratios are exceeded, the borrower's income may be considered adequate only if the lender determines and documents in the loan file the existence of compensating factors concerning the borrower's creditworthiness that support approval of the loan.</P>
                <P>(2) In determining whether the borrower's income is adequate, the following definitions are applicable:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Effective gross income</E> is defined as continuing income from all sources that is reasonably expected to be available during the first two years of the loan obligation, without any deduction for income taxes or other items.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Total fixed expenses</E> is the sum of the borrower's housing expenses and other recurring charges.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Housing expenses</E> includes all payments for principal, interest, loan or mortgage insurance charges, ground rent or leasehold charges, real estate taxes, hazard insurance, and homeowners association or condominium fees, but does not include utility costs.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Other recurring charges</E> include all payments on automobile loans, furniture loans, student loans, installment loans, revolving charge accounts, alimony or child support, and any other debt for which the obligation is expected to continue for six months or more.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Evidence of delinquency, default or misrepresentation.</E> Except with the prior approval of the Secretary the lender shall not approve a loan if the lender has knowledge of any of the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) The borrower is past due more than 30 days as to the payment of principal or interest under the original terms of a loan obligation owed to or insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government, unless the debt has since been discharged or satisfied; or</P>
                <P>(2) The borrower has previously made material misstatements of fact on applications for loans or other assistance.</P>

The dealer shall furnish a current financial statement prepared by someone who is independent of the dealer and is qualified by education and experience to prepare such statements, together with such other documentation as the lender deems necessary to support its approval of the dealer. The lender shall obtain a commercial credit report on the dealer and consumer credit reports on the owners, principals, and officers of the dealership.</P>
                <P>(3) The lender shall require each dealer to apply annually for reapproval. The dealer shall furnish the same documentation as is required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to support its application for reapproval. In no case shall the lender reapprove a dealer that is unable to meet the minimum net worth requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) The lender shall supervise and monitor each approved dealer's activities with respect to loans insured under this part. The lender shall visit each approved dealer's places of business at least once in every six months to review its Title I performance and compliance. The lender shall maintain a file on each approved dealer which contains the executed dealer approval form and supporting documentation required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, together with information on the lender's experience with Title I loans involving the dealer. Each dealer file shall contain information about borrower defaults on Title I loans over time, records of completion or site-of-placement inspections conducted by the lender or its agent, copies of letters concerning borrower complaints and their resolution, and records of the lender's periodic review visits to the dealer's premises. The lender may also require that the dealer furnish records on individual loan transactions, if needed to enable the lender to review the dealer's Title I performance and compliance.</P>
                <P>(5) If a dealer does not satisfactorily perform its contractual obligations to borrowers, does not comply with Title I program requirements, or is unresponsive to the lender's supervision and monitoring requirements, the lender shall terminate the dealer's approval and immediately notify the Secretary with written documentation of the facts. A dealer whose approval is terminated under these circumstances shall not be reapproved without prior written approval from the Secretary. The lender may in its discretion terminate the approval of a dealer for other reasons at any time.</P>
                <P>(6) The lender shall require each approved (or reapproved) dealer to provide written notification of any material change in its trade name(s), place(s) of business, type of ownership, type of business, or principal individuals who control or manage the business. The dealer shall furnish such notification to the lender within 30 days after the date of any material change.</P>

                <P>(7) As a condition of manufactured home dealer approval (or reapproval), the lender may require a manufactured home dealer to execute a written <PRTPAGE P="117"/>agreement that, if requested by the lender, the dealer will resell any manufactured home repossessed by the lender under a title I insured manufactured home purchase loan approved by the lender as a dealer loan involving that dealer.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Provision for full or partial recourse.</E> In the case of a dealer-originated manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan, the lender and the dealer may agree to a provision in the loan documents for partial or full recourse against the dealer, to reduce or eliminate the lender's loss in the event of foreclosure or repossession. Such recourse provision shall specify that, for a default occurring within a period of not more than three years from the date of the loan, the dealer shall reimburse the lender for a fixed percentage of the unpaid amount of the loan obligation, after deducting the proceeds from the sale of the property and any amounts received or retained by the lender after the date of default. However, the extent of the dealer's liability may not exceed 100 percent of the unpaid amount of the loan obligation prior to such deductions. When a claim is filed, the lender shall notify the Secretary if the loan was subject to a recourse agreement and whether the recourse agreement has been honored. If without the lender's approval a dealer has failed to honor its recourse obligation, the lender shall notify the Secretary and shall assign the recourse obligation to the Secretary in filing an insurance claim.</P>

Such insurance shall be obtained at any time during the term of the loan that the lender determines that the secured property is located in a special flood hazard area identified by FEMA, and shall be maintained by the borrower for the remaining term of the loan, or until the lender determines that the property is no longer in a special flood hazard area, or until the property is repossessed or foreclosed upon by the lender. The amount of such insurance shall be at least equal to the unpaid balance of the Title I loan, and the lender shall be named as the loss payee for flood insurance benefits.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Hazard insurance.</E> No manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan shall be eligible for insurance under this part unless hazard insurance on the manufactured home is obtained by the borrower and the lender is named as a loss payee of insurance benefits. Such insurance shall be maintained by the borrower for the full term of the loan or until the property is repossessed or foreclosed by the lender, and in an amount at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan, except that the amount of insurance coverage shall be not less that the actual cash value of the home where State law precludes a higher amount. If the borrower fails to maintain such insurance, the lender shall obtain it at the borrower's expense. If the home is not insured against hazards and sustains damage which would normally be covered by such insurance during the borrower's ownership, the appraised value of the home for claim purposes will be adjusted in accordance with § 201.51(b)(3). Upon acquiring title to the property through repossession or foreclosure, the lender shall maintain hazard insurance upon the property in the amount prescribed above until its disposition and sale.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Insurance charge.</E> For each eligible property improvement loan and manufactured home loan reported and acknowledged for insurance, the lender shall pay to the Secretary an insurance charge equal to 1.00 percent of the loan amount, multiplied by the number of years of the loan term. The insurance charge shall be paid in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section; however, no charge shall be made for a period of 14 days or less, and a charge for a full month shall be made for a period of more than 14 days. There shall be no abatement or refund of an insurance charge except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

                <P>(2)(i) For any loan having a maturity in excess of 25 months, payment of the insurance charge shall be made in annual installments, with the first installment due on the 25th calendar day after the date the Secretary acknowledges the loan report, and the second and successive installments due on the 25th calendar day after the date of billing by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(ii) For any loan having a maturity in excess of 25 months, payment shall be made in annual installments of 1.00 percent of the loan amount until the insurance charge is paid.</P>
                <P>(3) All insurance charges are considered earned when paid.</P>
                <P>(4) The Secretary may require that loan insurance charges be remitted electronically. Instructions implementing this requirement shall be communicated to all affected lenders.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Penalty charge and interest.</E> Insurance charges not received from the lender by the due date specified in <PRTPAGE P="119"/>paragraph (b) of this section shall be assessed a penalty charge of four percent of the amount of the payment. Insurance charges received from the lender more than 30 days after the due date specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall also be assessed daily interest at the current United States Treasury value of funds rate, as published periodically in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> However, no penalty charge or daily interest shall be assessed if the Secretary fails to acknowledge receipt of the loan report or fails to issue a proper billing to the lender for the insurance charges.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustment on notes transferred.</E> Where there is a transfer of loan obligations between lenders and the insurance charges on such obligations have already been paid, any adjustment of such charges shall be made by the lenders involved. Any unpaid installments of the insurance charge shall be paid by the purchasing lender.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Refund or abatement of insurance charges.</E> A lender shall be entitled to a refund or abatement of insurance charges only in the following instances:</P>
                <P>(1) Where the loan obligation has been refinanced, the unearned portion of the charge on the original obligation shall be credited to the charge on the refinanced loan.</P>

                <P>(3) When a loan (or portion thereof) is found to be ineligible for insurance, charges paid on the ineligible portion shall be refunded, except where the Secretary determines that there was fraud or misrepresentation by the lender in the loan transaction. Such refund shall be made only if a claim is denied by the Secretary or the ineligibility is reported by the lender promptly upon discovery and confirmed by the Secretary. In no event shall a charge be refunded on the basis of loan ineligibility where the application for refund is made after the loan is paid in full. If a loan or claim has been denied and is subsequently resubmitted, the refunded amount of the insurance charge plus any accrued insurance charge shall be repaid.</P>

Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the pledging of such a loan as collateral security under a trust agreement, or otherwise, in connection with a bona fide loan transaction.</P>

Except in cases involving the sale, assignment or transfer of loans sold with recourse or under a guaranty, guarantee or repurchase agreement, the Secretary shall transfer insurance coverage to or from a lender's reserve account to accompany the loan transfers reported by lenders under § 201.30.</P>

                <P>(1) In all cases involving the sale, assignment or transfer of loans sold without recourse, guaranty, guarantee, or repurchase agreement, the Secretary shall transfer insurance coverage to the reserve account established for the transferee lender in an amount equal to 10 percent of the actual purchase <PRTPAGE P="120"/>price or the net unpaid principal balance, whichever is lesser, but not to exceed the amount of insurance coverage in the transferor lender's reserve account prior to the transfer. Insurance coverage shall be added to the existing amount of insurance coverage in the transferee lender's reserve account. The Secretary may transfer insurance coverage with earmarking when a determination is made that it is in the Secretary's interest to do so.</P>
                <P>(2) In cases involving the transfer of loans sold with recourse or under a guaranty, guarantee or repurchase agreement, no insurance coverage will be transferred and no reports will be required.</P>
                <P>(3) An existing insured property improvement loan or manufactured home loan may not be refinanced by a lender different from the originating or purchasing lender of record, unless the loan has been sold, assigned, or transferred to the new lender under paragraph (c) of this section and the Secretary has transferred insurance coverage for the loan under the applicable requirements of this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Recovery shall not affect insurance coverage reserve account.</E> Amounts which may be recovered by the Secretary after payment of an insurance claim shall not be added to the amount of insurance coverage remaining in a lender's reserve account.</P>

In such case, the insurance of the loan shall not be affected unless such material misstatement of fact or misuse of loan proceeds was caused by or was knowingly sanctioned by the lender or its employees (see § 201.31(e)(3)), provided that the validity of any lien on the property has not been impaired.</P>

                <P>(2) The borrower shall submit the completion certificate promptly upon the work's completion, but not later than six months after the disbursement of the loan proceeds, with one six-month extension if necessary. If the borrower fails to submit the completion certificate within these time limits, an on-site inspection shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) The borrower is not required to submit a completion certificate when the property improvement loan is made by or on behalf of a State or local government agency or a nonprofit organization, the loan proceeds are held in an escrow account pending completion of the improvements, and the loan proceeds are disbursed from the escrow account in stages, with the written approval of the borrower and based upon the percentage of work completed.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Inspection requirement on property improvement loans.</E> The lender or its agent shall conduct an on-site inspection on any property improvement loan where the principal obligation is $7,500 or more, and on any direct property improvement loan where the borrower fails to submit a completion certificate <PRTPAGE P="121"/>as required under paragraph (b) of this section. On a dealer loan, the inspection shall be completed within 60 days after the date of disbursement. On a direct loan, the inspection shall be completed within 60 days after receipt of the completion certificate, or as soon as the lender determines that the borrower is unwilling to cooperate in submitting the completion certificate. The purpose of the inspection is to verify the eligibility of the improvements and whether the work has been completed. If the borrower will not cooperate in permitting an on-site inspection, the lender shall report this fact to the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(1) The terms and conditions of the purchase contract have been met;</P>
                <P>(2) The manufactured home and any itemized options and appurtenances included in the purchase price of the home or financed with the loan proceeds have been delivered and installed; and</P>

Before taking action to accelerate the maturity of the loan, the lender or its agent shall contact the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer, either in a face-to-face meeting or by telephone, to discuss the reasons for the default and to seek its cure. If the borrower and the co-makers or co-signers cannot be located, will not discuss the default, or will not agree to its cure, the lender may proceed to take action under paragraph (b) of this section. The lender shall document the results of its efforts to contact the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer, and shall place in the loan file a copy of any modification agreement or repayment plan that has been offered.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of default and acceleration.</E> Unless the borrower cures the default or agrees to a modification agreement or repayment plan, the lender shall provide the borrower with written notice that the loan is in default and that the loan maturity is to be accelerated.

                <P>(3) A demand upon the borrower either to cure the default (by bringing the loan current or by refinancing the loan) or to agree to a modification agreement or a repayment plan, by not later than the date 30 days from the date of the notice;</P>
                <P>(4) A statement that if the borrower fails either to cure the default or to agree to a modification agreement or a repayment plan by the date 30 days from the date of the notice, then, as of the date 30 days from the date of the notice, the maturity of the loan is accelerated and full payment of all amounts due under the loan is required;</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Property improvement loans.</E> (1) After acceleration of maturity on a secured property improvement loan, the lender may either proceed against the loan security under its title I security instrument or make claim under its contract of insurance. If the lender proceeds against the loan security, it may submit an insurance claim only if it complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The lender may proceed against the secured property under its Title I security instrument and later submit a claim under its contract of insurance only with the prior approval of the Secretary. The Secretary's decision will be based upon all relevant factors, including but not limited to the appraised value and the amount of all outstanding loan obligations on the property, the estimated costs of foreclosure and disposition, and the anticipated time to dispose of the property. In proceeding against the secured property, the lender shall comply with all applicable State and local laws, and shall take all actions necessary to preserve its rights, if any, to obtain a valid and enforceable deficiency judgment against the borrower.</P>
                <P>(3) After acceleration of maturity on a defaulted unsecured property improvement loan, the lender may submit a claim under its contract of insurance.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Manufactured home loans.</E> (1) After acceleration of maturity on a defaulted manufactured home loan, the lender shall proceed against the loan security by foreclosure or repossession, as appropriate, in compliance with all applicable State and local laws, and shall acquire good, marketable title to the property securing the loan. The lender shall also take all actions necessary under State and local law to preserve its rights, if any, to obtain a valid and enforceable deficiency judgment against the borrower.</P>
                <P>(2) Prior to foreclosure or repossession, the lender or its agent shall make a visual inspection of the property and prepare a report on its condition for placement in the loan file. If the lender determines that the property has been abandoned, the lender shall take such steps as are permitted under State or local law to repossess or foreclose upon the property, without waiting for the notice period under § 201.50(b) to run.</P>
                <P>(3) The lender shall obtain a HUD-approved appraisal of the property as soon after repossession as possible, or earlier with the permission of the borrower. This appraisal shall be performed on the homesite, unless the site owner requires that the home be removed before the appraisal can be performed, and it should reflect the retail value of comparable manufactured homes in similar condition and in the same geographic area where the repossession occurred. When the manufactured home is without hazard insurance and has sustained, at any time prior to the sale or disposition of the home, damage which would normally be covered by such insurance, the lender shall report this situation in submitting an insurance claim, and the appraised value shall be based upon the retail value of comparable homes in good condition and in the same geographic area, without any deduction for such damage.</P>

The lender may accept voluntary surrender of the property without satisfaction of the borrower's obligation, provided that if the lender intends thereafter to submit a claim under its contract of insurance, the lender shall acquire title to or ownership of the property and then dispose of and sell the property in compliance with State and local law, so as to assure that it can assign a valid and enforceable obligation, including any deficiency against the borrower, to the Secretary when submitting its claim.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Claim application.</E> A claim for reimbursement for loss on any eligible loan shall be made on a HUD-approved form, executed by a duly qualified officer of the lender under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation. The insurance claim shall be fully documented and itemized, and shall be accompanied by all documents and materials required by the Secretary for claim review. The claim submission shall contain original copies of all notes, security instruments, assumption agreements, releases of liability for repayment of the loan, judgments obtained by the lender against the borrower, and any related documents and forms, except where State or local law requires their retention by the lender or a governmental body such as a court. As appropriate, the claim application shall be supported by the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Documentation of the lender's efforts to effect recourse against any dealer in accordance with any recourse agreement under § 201.27(b) between the lender and the dealer and contained in the loan documents;</P>
                <P>(2) Certification under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation that the lender has complied with all applicable State and local laws in carrying out any foreclosure or repossession, including copies of all notices served upon the borrower or published in connection with such foreclosure or repossession; and</P>
                <P>(3) Where a borrower has declared bankruptcy or insolvency or is deceased, copies of the documentation required to be retained in the loan file under § 201.42.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum claim period.</E> (1) An insurance claim shall be filed not later than the following dates:</P>
                <P>(i) For property improvement loans—nine months after the date of default.</P>
                <P>(ii) For manufactured home loans—three months after the date of sale of the property securing the loan, but not to exceed 18 months after the date of default.</P>
                <P>(2) The Secretary may extend the claim filing period in a particular case, but only if the lender shows clear evidence that the delay in claim filing was in the interest of the Secretary or was caused by one of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Litigation related to the loan;</P>
                <P>(ii) Management control of the lender or the Title I loan portfolio was assumed by a Federal or State agency; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The borrower had experienced a loss of income or other financial difficulties directly attributable to a major disaster declared by the President, and additional time was needed to provide forbearance on a property improvement loan.</P>

                <P>(3) If a borrower is a “person in military service” as that term is defined in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 and is in default on a loan insured under this part, any period of military service after the date of default shall be excluded in computing <PRTPAGE P="125"/>the maximum time period for filing an insurance claim.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Resubmitted and supplemental claims.</E> (1) Any insurance claim which is resubmitted with an appeal of a claim denial or a request for a waiver of the regulations in accordance with § 201.5(b) shall be filed within six months after the date of the claim denial.</P>
                <P>(2) Any supplemental insurance claim shall be filed within six months after the date of payment on the initial claim. A reprocessing fee, in an amount prescribed by the Secretary, will be charged for any supplemental claim.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Assignment of lender's rights to the United States.</E> Upon the filing of the insurance claim, the lender shall assign its entire interest in the loan note (or in a judgment in lieu of the note), in any security held, and in any claim filed in probate, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, to the United States of America. The assignment shall be made in the form provided in paragraph (f) of this section, provided that if this form is not valid or generally acceptable in the jurisdiction involved, a form which is valid and generally acceptable in the jurisdiction where the judgment or security was taken shall be used. If the security interest has been assigned to the United States, the assignment shall be recorded in that jurisdiction prior to filing the insurance claim, unless the Secretary determines that recordation by the lender in that jurisdiction is impractical.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Valid and enforceable obligation when assigned.</E> The loan obligation evidenced by the note must be both valid and enforceable against the debtor at the time the note is assigned to the United States of America. If the Secretary has reason to believe that the obligation may not be either valid or enforceable against the borrower, the Secretary may either deny the claim and reassign the loan note to the lender, or require the lender to repurchase the paid claim and accept reassignment of the note. The lender will be notified of the reasons for the claim denial or repurchase. If the lender subsequently obtains a valid and enforceable judgment against the borrower for the unpaid balance of the loan, the lender may resubmit the claim with an assignment of the judgment.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Form of assignment.</E> A lender shall use the following form of assignment, or one generally acceptable in the jurisdiction involved, properly dated, to assign the lender's entire interest in a loan note, judgment, real estate mortgage, deed of trust, conditional sales contract, chattel mortgage, mechanic's lien, or any security, in making an insurance claim:

                <P>(4) The amount of a sales commission paid to a dealer, real estate agent or other third party for the resale of the repossessed or foreclosed manufactured home and/or lot.

                <SUBJECT>Approval status for lenders and mortgagees.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial approval.</E> A lender or mortgagee may be approved for participation in the Title I or Title II programs upon filing a request for approval on a form prescribed by the Secretary and signed by the applicant. The approval form shall be accompanied by such documentation as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(1) Approval is signified by:</P>
                <P>(i) The Secretary's agreement that the lender or mortgagee is considered approved under the Title I or Title II programs, except as otherwise ordered by the Mortgagee Review Board or an officer or subdivision of the Department to which the Mortgagee Review Board has delegated its power, unless the lender or mortgagee voluntarily relinquishes its approval;</P>
                <P>(ii) Consent by the lender or mortgagee to comply at all times with the general approval requirements of § 202.5, and with additional requirements governing the particular class of lender or mortgagee for which it was approved as described under subpart B at §§ 202.6 through 202.10; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Under the Title I program, the issuance of a Contract of Insurance constitutes an agreement between the Secretary and the lender and which governs participation in the Title I program.</P>
                <P>(2) Limitations on approval:</P>
                <P>(i) Separate approval as lender or mortgagee is required for participation in the Title I or Title II programs, respectively. Application must be made, and approval will be granted, on the basis of one or both categories of programs, as is appropriate.</P>
                <P>(ii) Separate approval as mortgagee is required for the Single Family Mortgage Insurance Programs and for the Multifamily Mortgage Insurance Programs. Application must be made, and approval will be granted, on the basis of either or both categories, as is appropriate.</P>
                <P>(iii) In addition to the requirements for approval as a Title II mortgagee, the Secretary may from time to time issue eligibility requirements for participation in specific programs, such as the Direct Endorsement program.</P>
                <P>(iv) A Title II mortgagee may be approved to operate either on a nationwide basis or on a geographically restricted basis in only those areas designated by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(v) A Title I lender may originate loans or purchase advances of credit only within a geographic lending area approved by the Secretary. Expansion of this lending area shall be subject to a determination by the Secretary that the lender is able to originate loans in compliance with part 201 of this chapter within such expanded area.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Authorized agents.</E> A mortgagee approved under §§ 202.6, 202.7, or 202.10 as a nonsupervised mortgagee, supervised mortgagee, or governmental or similar institution approved as a Direct Endorsement mortgagee under 24 CFR 203.3 may, with the approval of the Secretary, designate a nonsupervised or supervised mortgagee with Direct Endorsement approval under 24 CFR 203.3 as authorized agent for the purpose of underwriting loans. The application for mortgage insurance may be submitted in the name of the FHA-approved mortgagee or its designated authorized agent under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Recertification.</E> On each anniversary of the approval of a lender or mortgagee, the Secretary will determine whether recertification, i.e., continued approval, is appropriate. The Secretary will review the yearly verification report required by § 202.5(m) and other pertinent documents, ascertain that all application and annual fees have been paid, and request any further information needed to decide upon recertification.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination</E>—(1) <E T="03">Termination of the Title I Contract of Insurance</E>—(i) <E T="03">Notice.</E>
                  <PRTPAGE P="130"/>A Contract of Insurance may be terminated in accordance with its terms by the Secretary or by the Secretary's designee upon giving the lender at least 5 days prior written notice.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Informal meeting.</E> If requested, and before expiration of the 5-day notice period, a lender shall be entitled to an informal meeting with the Department official taking action to terminate the Contract of Insurance.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Effect of termination.</E> Termination of a Contract of Insurance shall not affect:</P>
                <P>(A) The Department's obligation to provide insurance coverage with respect to eligible loans originated before the termination, unless there was fraud or misrepresentation;</P>
                <P>(B) A lender's obligation to continue to pay insurance charges or premiums and meet all other obligations, including servicing, associated with eligible loans originated before termination; or</P>
                <P>(C) A lender's right to apply for and be granted a new Title I Contract of Insurance, provided that the requirements for approval under this part are met.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Credit Watch Termination.</E> (i) <E T="03">Scope and frequency of review.</E> The Secretary will review, on an ongoing basis, the number of defaults and claims on mortgages originated, underwritten, or both, by each mortgagee in the geographic area served by a HUD field office. HUD will make this rate information available to mortgagees and the public through electronic means and will issue instructions for accessing this information through a Mortgagee Letter. For this purpose, and for all purposes under paragraph (c) of this section, a mortgage is considered to be originated in the same federal fiscal year in which its amortization commences. The Secretary may also review the insured mortgage performance of a mortgagee's branch offices individually and may terminate the authority of the branch or the authority of the mortgagee's overall operation.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Credit Watch Status.</E> Mortgagees are responsible for monitoring their default and claim rate performance. A mortgagee is considered to be on Credit Watch Status if, at any time, the mortgagee has a rate of defaults and claims on insured mortgages originated, underwritten, or both, in an area which exceeds 150 percent of the normal rate and its origination approval agreement has not been terminated.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Notice of termination.</E> (A) <E T="03">Notice of termination of origination approval agreement.</E> The Secretary may notify a mortgagee that its origination approval agreement will terminate 60 days after notice is given, if the mortgagee had a rate of defaults and claims on insured mortgages originated in an area which exceeded 200 percent of the normal rate and exceeded the national default and claim rate for insured mortgages.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Notice of termination of direct endorsement approval.</E> The Secretary may notify a mortgagee that its direct endorsement approval under 24 CFR part 203 will terminate 60 days after notice is given, if the mortgagee had a rate of defaults and claims on insured mortgages underwritten in an area which exceeded 200 percent of the normal rate and exceeded the national default and claim rate for insured mortgages. The termination of a mortgagee's direct endorsement approval pursuant to this section is separate and apart from the termination of a mortgagee's direct endorsement approval under 24 CFR part 203.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">No need for prior action by Mortgagee Review Board.</E> The termination notices described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section may be given without prior action by the Mortgagee Review Board.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Underserved areas.</E> Before the Secretary sends the termination notice, the Secretary shall review the Census tract concentrations of the defaults and claims. If the Secretary determines that the excessive rate is the result of mortgage lending in underserved areas, as defined in 24 CFR 81.2, the Secretary may determine not to terminate the mortgagee's origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Request for informal conference.</E> Prior to termination the mortgagee may submit a written request for an informal conference with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or that official's designee. HUD must receive the written request no later than 30 calendar days after the <PRTPAGE P="131"/>date of the proposed termination notice. Unless HUD grants an extension, the informal conference must be held no later than 60 calendar days after the date of the proposed termination notice. After considering relevant reasons and factors beyond the mortgagee's control that contributed to the excessive default and claim rates, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or designee may withdraw the termination notice.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Limitation on the establishment of new branches.</E> Upon receipt of a proposed termination notice of its origination approval agreement, the mortgagee shall not establish a new branch or new branches for the origination of FHA-insured mortgages in the area or areas that are covered by the proposed termination notice. As of January 18, 2005, a mortgagee that is in receipt of a notice of proposed termination may not establish any new branch in the location or locations cited in the proposed termination notice until either:</P>
                <P>(A) The proposed termination notice is withdrawn or</P>
                <P>(B) The Secretary reinstates the mortgagee's origination approval agreement, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Effects of termination.</E> (A) <E T="03">Termination of origination approval agreement.</E> If a mortgagee's origination approval agreement is terminated, it may not originate single family insured mortgages unless the origination approval agreement is reinstated by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of this part except § 202.3(c)(2)(vii)(A).</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Termination of direct endorsement approval.</E> If a mortgagee's direct endorsement approval is terminated, it may not underwrite single family insured mortgages for the area(s) identified in the termination notice, unless the direct endorsement approval is reinstated by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of this part except § 202.3(c)(2)(vii)(A).</P>
                <P>(vii) <E T="03">Rights and obligations in the event of termination.</E> Termination of the origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval shall not affect:</P>
                <P>(A) The eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, absent fraud or misrepresentation, if the mortgagor and all terms and conditions of the mortgage had been approved before the termination by the Direct Endorsement or Lender Insurance mortgagee or were covered by a firm commitment issued by the Secretary; however, no other mortgages originated or underwritten after the date of termination by the mortgagee shall be insured unless the mortgagee's origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval is reinstated by the Secretary;</P>
                <P>(B) The right of a mortgagee whose direct endorsement approval has been terminated to transfer cases to another mortgagee with direct endorsement approval for the area covered by the termination.</P>
                <P>(C) A mortgagee's obligation to continue to pay insurance premiums and meet all other obligations, including servicing, associated with insured mortgages;</P>
                <P>(D) A mortgagee's right to apply for reinstatement of the origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(E) A mortgagee's right to purchase insured mortgages or to service its own portfolio or the portfolios of other mortgagees with which it has a servicing contract.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Withdrawal and suspension of approval.</E> Lender or mortgagee approval may be suspended or withdrawn by the Mortgagee Review Board as provided in part 25 of this title.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Reinstatement</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A mortgagee whose origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval has been terminated under paragraph (c) of this section may apply for reinstatement if:</P>
                <P>(i) The origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval for the affected branch or branches has been terminated for at least six months; and</P>

                <P>(ii) The mortgagee continues to be an approved mortgagee meeting the general standards of § 202.5 and the specific requirements of §§ 202.6, 202.7, 202.8 or 202.10, and 202.12.<PRTPAGE P="132"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for reinstatement.</E> The mortgagee's application for reinstatement must:</P>
                <P>(i) Be in a format prescribed by the Secretary and signed by the mortgagee;</P>
                <P>(ii) Be accompanied by an independent analysis of the terminated office's operations and identifying the underlying cause of the mortgagee's unacceptable default and claim rate. The independent analysis must be prepared by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) qualified to perform audits under the government auditing standards issued by the General Accounting Office; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Be accompanied by a corrective action plan addressing each of the issues identified in the independent analysis described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, along with evidence demonstrating that the mortgagee has implemented the corrective action plan.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">HUD action on reinstatement application.</E> The Secretary will grant the mortgagee's application for reinstatement if the mortgagee's application is complete and the Secretary determines that the underlying causes for the termination have been satisfactorily remedied.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> A Federal, State or municipal governmental agency, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Federal National Mortgage Association may be an approved lender or mortgagee. A mortgagee approved under this section may submit applications for Title II mortgage insurance. A lender or mortgagee approved under this section may originate, purchase, service or sell Title I loans and insured mortgages, respectively. A mortgagee or lender approved under this section is not required to meet a net worth requirement.

A variation is determined as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Customary lending practices.</E> The customary lending practices of a mortgagee include all single family insured mortgages originated by the mortgagee, including mortgages that were originated by the mortgagee's sponsored third-party originator(s).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Basis for permissible variations.</E> Any variations in the mortgage charge rate up to two percentage points under the mortgagee's customary lending practices must be based on actual variations in fees or cost to the mortgagee to make the mortgage loan, which shall be determined after accounting for the value of servicing rights generated by making the loan and other income to the mortgagee related to the loan. Fees or costs must be fully documented for each specific loan.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Area.</E> For purposes of this section, an area is:</P>
                <P>(i) An area used by HUD for purposes of § 203.18(a) of this chapter to determine the median 1-family house price for an area; or</P>

                <P>(4) <E T="03">Interest rate.</E> Whenever a mortgagee offers a particular interest rate for a mortgage type in an area, it may not restrict the availability of the rate in the area on the basis of the principal amount of the mortgage. A mortgagee may not direct mortgage applicants to any specific interest rate category on the basis of mortgage size.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Mortgage charge rate.</E> The mortgage charge rate is defined as the amount of mortgage charges for a mortgage expressed as a percentage of the initial principal amount of the mortgage.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Determining excess variations.</E> Variation in mortgage charge rates for a mortgage type is determined by comparing all mortgage charge rates offered by the mortgagee within an area for the mortgage type for a designated day or other time period, including mortgage charge rates for all actual mortgage applications.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Mortgage type.</E> A mortgage type for purposes of paragraph (a)(6) of this section will include those mortgages that are closely parallel in important characteristics affecting pricing and charges, such as level of risk or processing expenses. The Secretary may develop standards and definitions regarding mortgage types.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> Mortgagees are required to maintain records on pricing information, satisfactory to the Secretary, that would allow for reasonable inspection by HUD for a period of at least 2 years. Additionally, many mortgagees are required to maintain racial, ethnic, and gender data under the regulations implementing the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. 2801-2810).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Servicing.</E> Any mortgagee that services mortgages must be approved by the Secretary under § 202.6, § 202.7 or § 202.10, or be specifically approved for servicing under § 202.9(a).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Report and corrective plan requirements.</E> If a mortgagee approved for participation in Title II programs is notified by the Secretary that it had a rate of defaults and claims on HUD-insured mortgages during the preceding year, or during recent years, which was higher than the normal rate, it shall submit a report, within 60 days, containing an explanation for the above-normal rate of defaults and claims, and, if required by the Secretary, a plan for corrective action with regard <PRTPAGE P="141"/>to mortgages in default and its mortgage processing system in general.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Direct Endorsement approval.</E> To be approved for the Direct Endorsement program set forth in § 203.5, a mortgagee must be an approved mortgagee meeting the requirements of §§ 202.13, 202.14 or 202.17 and this section.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Special requirements.</E> The mortgagee must establish that it meets the following qualifications.</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgagee has five years of experience in the origination of single family mortgages. The Secretary will approve a mortgagee with less than five years experience in the origination of single family mortgages if a principal officer has had a minimum of five years of managerial experience in the origination of single family mortgages.</P>
                  <P>(2) The mortgagee has on its permanent staff an underwriter that is authorized by the mortgagee to bind the mortgagee on matters involving the origination of mortgages through the Direct Endorsement procedure and that is registered with the Secretary and such registration is maintained with the Secretary. The technical staff may be employees of the mortgagee or may be hired on a fee basis from a roster maintained by the Secretary. The mortgagee shall use appraisers permitted by § 203.5(e).</P>
                  <P>(3) [Reserved]</P>
                  <P>(4) The mortgagee must submit initially 15 mortgages processed in accordance with §§ 203.5 and 203.255. Separate approval is required to originate mortgages under part 206 of this chapter through the Direct Endorsement program unless at least 50 mortgages closed by the mortgagee have been insured under part 206 of this chapter prior to September 15, 1995. Other mortgagees who have not closed at least 50 mortgages under part 206 of this chapter must submit five (5) Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, processed in accordance with §§ 203.3 and 203.255. The documents required by § 203.255 will be reviewed by the Secretary and, if acceptable, commitments will be issued prior to endorsement of the mortgages for insurance. If the underwriting and processing of these 15 mortgages (or the 5 Home Equity Conversion Mortgages) is satisfactory, then the mortgagee may be approved to close subsequent mortgages and submit them directly for endorsement for insurance in accordance with the process set forth in § 203.255. Unsatisfactory performance by the mortgagee at this stage constitutes grounds for denial of participation in the program, or for continued pre-endorsement review of a mortgagee's submissions. If participation in the program is denied, such denial is effective immediately and may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Unsatisfactory performance solely with respect to mortgages under 24 CFR part 206 may, at the option of the Secretary, be grounds for denial of participation or for continued pre-endorsement review for 24 CFR part 206 mortgages without affecting the mortgagee's processing of mortgages under other parts.</P>
                  <P>(5) The mortgagee shall promptly notify those HUD offices which have granted approval under this section of any changes that affect qualifications under this section.</P>
                  <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Mortgagee sanctions.</E> Depending upon the nature and extent of the noncompliance with the requirements applicable to the Direct Endorsement process, as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may take any of the following actions:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Probation.</E> The Secretary may place a mortgagee on Direct Endorsement probation for a specified period of time for the purpose of evaluating the mortgagee's compliance with the requirements of the Direct Endorsement procedure. Such probation is distinct <PRTPAGE P="146"/>from probation imposed by the Mortgagee Review Board under part 25 of this chapter. During the probation period specified by this section, the mortgagee may continue to process Direct Endorsement mortgages, subject to conditions required by the Secretary. The Secretary may require the mortgagee to:</P>
                  <P>(i) Process mortgages in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Submit to additional training;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Make changes in the quality control plan required by § 202.5(h) of this chapter; and</P>
                  <P>(iv) Take other actions, which may include, but are not limited to, periodic reporting to the Secretary, and submission to the Secretary of internal audits.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Termination of Direct Endorsement approval.</E> (i) A mortgagee's approval to participate in the Direct Endorsement program may be terminated in a particular jurisdiction by the local HUD office or on a nationwide basis by HUD Central Office. The HUD office instituting the termination action shall provide the mortgagee with written notice of the grounds for the action and of the right to an informal hearing before the office initiating the termination action. Such hearing shall be expeditiously arranged, and the mortgagee may be represented by counsel. Any termination instituted under this section is distinct from withdrawal of mortgagee approval by the Mortgagee Review Board under part 25 of this title.</P>
                  <P>(ii) After consideration of the materials presented, the decision maker shall advise the mortgagee in writing whether the termination is rescinded, modified or affirmed.</P>
                  <P>(iii) The mortgagee may appeal such decision to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or his or her designee. A decision by the Deputy Assistant Secretary or designee shall constitute final agency action.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Termination of an origination approval agreement under part 202 of this chapter for a mortgagee or one or more branch offices automatically terminates Direct Endorsement approval for the mortgagee or the branch office or offices without any further requirement to comply with this paragraph.</P>

                  <P>(2) HUD may approve a mortgagee that is otherwise eligible for Lender Insurance approval, but has an acceptable claim and default record of less than 2 years, if:</P>

                  <P>(3) A mortgagee has an acceptable claim and default rate if its rate of claims and defaults is at or below 150 percent of the average rate for insured mortgages in the state(s) in which the mortgagee operates.</P>

                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of approval.</E> (1) HUD may immediately terminate the mortgagee's approval to participate in the Lender Insurance program, in accordance with section 256(d) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-21(d)), if the mortgagee:</P>
                  <P>(i) Violates any of the requirements and procedures established by the Secretary for mortgagees approved to participate in HUD's Lender Insurance program, Direct Endorsement program, or the Title II Single Family mortgage insurance program; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) If HUD determines that other good cause exists.</P>
                  <P>(2) Such termination will be effective upon receipt of HUD's notice advising of the termination. Within 30 days after receiving HUD's notice of termination, a mortgagee may request an informal conference with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or designee. The conference will be conducted within 30 days after HUD receives a timely request for the conference. After the conference, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (or designee) may decide to affirm the termination action or to reinstate the mortgagee's Lender Insurance program approval. The decision will be communicated to the mortgagee in writing, will be deemed a final agency action, and, pursuant to section 256(d) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-21(d)), is not subject to judicial review.</P>
                  <P>(3) Lender Insurance authority is automatically terminated for a mortgagee whose nationwide Direct Endorsement approval under § 203.3(d)(2) is terminated, without imposing any further requirement on the mortgagee to comply with this paragraph.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Under the Direct Endorsement program, the Secretary does not review applications for mortgage insurance before the mortgage is executed or issue conditional or firm commitments, except to the extent required by § 203.3(b)(4), § 203.3(d)(1), or as determined by the Secretary. Under this program, the mortgagee determines that the proposed mortgage is eligible for insurance under the applicable program regulations, and submits the required documents to the Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 203.255. This subpart provides that certain functions shall be <PRTPAGE P="148"/>performed by the Secretary (or Commissioner), but the Secretary may specify that a Direct Endorsement mortgagee shall perform such an action without specific involvement or approval by the Secretary, subject to statutory limitations. In each case, the Direct Endorsement mortgagee's performance is subject to pre-endorsement and post-endorsement review by the Secretary under § 203.255 (c) and (e).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible programs.</E> (1) All single family mortgages authorized for insurance under the National Housing Act must be originated through the Direct Endorsement program, except the following:</P>
                  <P>(i) Mortgages underwritten for insurance by mortgagees that have applied for participation in, and have been approved for, the Lender Insurance program;</P>

                  <P>(iii) As provided in § 203.1.</P>
                  <P>(2) The provision contained in § 221.55 of this chapter regarding deferred sales to displaced families is not available in the Direct Endorsement program.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Underwriter due diligence.</E> A Direct Endorsement mortgagee shall exercise the same level of care which it would exercise in obtaining and verifying information for a loan in which the mortgagee would be entirely dependent on the property as security to protect its investment. Mortgagee procedures that evidence such due diligence shall be incorporated as part of the quality control plan required under § 202.5(h) of this chapter. The Secretary shall publish guidelines for Direct Endorsement underwriting procedures in a handbook, which shall be provided to all mortgagees approved for the Direct Endorsement procedure. Compliance with these guidelines is deemed to be the minimum standard of due diligence in underwriting mortgages.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Mortgagor's income.</E> The mortgagee shall evaluate the mortgagor's credit characteristics, adequacy and stability of income to meet the periodic payments under the mortgage and all other obligations, and the adequacy of the mortgagor's available assets to close the transaction, and render an underwriting decision in accordance with applicable regulations, policies and procedures.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Appraisal.</E> (1) A mortgagee shall have the property appraised in accordance with such standards and requirements as the Secretary may prescribe. A mortgagee must select an appraiser whose name is on the FHA Appraiser Roster, in accordance with 24 CFR part 200, subpart G.</P>
                  <P>(2) The mortgagee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or disability in the selection of an appraiser.</P>
                  <P>(3) A mortgagee and an appraiser must ensure that an appraisal and related documentation satisfy FHA appraisal requirements, and both bear responsibility for the quality of the appraisal in satisfying such requirements. A Direct Endorsement Mortgagee that submits, or causes to be submitted, an appraisal or related documentation that does not satisfy FHA requirements is subject to administrative sanction by the Mortgagee Review Board pursuant to parts 25 and 30 of this title.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Mortgagee to provide disclosure notice.</E> A mortgagee must provide a prospective FHA mortgagor with an informed consumer choice disclosure notice if, in the mortgagees's judgment, the prospective FHA mortgagor may qualify for similar conventional mortgage products offered by the mortgagee. The mortgagee should base this judgment on the mortgagee's initial assessment of the prospective FHA mortgagor's eligibility for a conventional mortgage product. If a mortgagee is unsure about a prospective FHA mortgagor's eligibility for a conventional mortgage product, the mortgagee should provide the prospective FHA mortgagor with an informed consumer choice disclosure notice.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Informed consumer choice disclosure notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> The informed consumer choice disclosure notice must:</P>
                  <P>(i) Provide a one page generic analysis comparing the mortgage costs of an FHA-insured mortgage with the mortgage costs of similar conventional mortgage products offered by the mortgagee that the prospective FHA mortgagor may qualify for;</P>

                  <P>(iii) Meet the requirements of section 203(b)(2) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)(2)).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Format of disclosure notice.</E> The informed consumer choice disclosure notice must be provided in a format prescribed by the Commissioner. HUD has prepared a model informed consumer choice disclosure notice that represents this format and that meets the requirements of section 203(b)(2) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)(2)). The model informed consumer choice disclosure notice contains the minimum elements of an informed consumer choice disclosure notice. These elements must be included in a mortgagee's informed consumer choice disclosure notice. A mortgagee, however, may include additional elements in an informed consumer choice disclosure notice to better reflect the mortgagee's products or to provide information that the mortgagee believes is meaningful and helpful to the mortgagee's customers.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Availability of model disclosure notice.</E> HUD's model informed consumer choice disclosure notice is made available to FHA-approved mortgagees through Mortgagee Letter and is available to the public through the internet at HUD's web site at <E T="03">http://www.hud.gov</E> or by contacting: Home Mortgage Insurance Division, Office of Insured Single Family Housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410-8000; telephone (202) 708-2700 (this is not a toll-free number), or the nearest HUD Homeownership Center (Atlanta, GA (888) 696-4687; Denver, CO (800) 543-9378; Philadelphia, PA (800) 440-8647; or Santa Ana, CA (888) 827-<PRTPAGE P="150"/>5605).

                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Revision of notice.</E> A mortgagee should revise its informed consumer choice disclosure notice periodically to reflect prevailing market conditions. To ensure that the informed consumer choice disclosure notice reflects prevailing market conditions, a mortgagee must revise its informed consumer choice disclosure notice at least once annually.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to any application for mortgage insurance authorized under section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709) that the mortgagee receives on or after September 2, 1999.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Increased mortgage amount.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) If any party believes that a mortgage limit established by the Secretary under § 203.18(a)(1) does not accurately reflect the median house prices in an area, the party may submit documentation in support of an alternative mortgage limit. For purposes of this section, an area (1) must be at least the size of a county, whether or not the area is located within a metropolitan statistical area, as established by the Office of Management and Budget; and (2) may be an area for which the mortgage limits established under § 203.18(b)(1) apply.</P>
                  <P>(b)(1) The documentation referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must consist of sufficient housing sales price data for the entire geographic area for which the request is made to justify an alternative mortgage limit. The documentation should include a listing of actual sales prices in the area for all or nearly all new and existing 1-family homes and condominiums, over a period of time varies with sales volume, as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) For 500 or more sales per month, a one-month reporting period;</P>
                  <P>(ii) For 250 through 499 sales per month, a two-month reporting period.</P>
                  <P>(iii) For less than 250 sales per month, a three-month reporting period.</P>

                  <FP>The listing should contain a brief address for each property, its county location, its sale price, the month and year of its sale, and whether it is new or existing. In areas where the ratio of existing sales to new sales is three-to-one or greater, an increase in the mortgage limit may be based on 95 percent <PRTPAGE P="156"/>of the average of the new and the existing median sales prices. In these areas, the documentation referred to in this paragraph may also include separate median sales prices for both the new and existing homes.</FP>
                  <P>(2) Requests for an increased mortgage limit based upon documentation of median house prices for the area should be sent to the appropriate HUD field office.</P>

                  <P>(c) In the case of an area where the Commissioner determines that the median one-family house price does not reasonably reflect the sales prices of newly constructed homes because of an existing stock whose value is static or declining, the Commissioner may give greater weight to the sales prices of new homes in determining median house price in such area. Without limiting the discretion of the Commissioner in fashioning appropriate methods of implementing the foregoing authority in particular circumstances based upon a demonstration of good cause satisfactory to the Commissioner, in areas where evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner indicates that existing home sales outnumber new home sales by three-to-one or better, the <E T="03">median sales price</E> will be calculated as the greater of (1) the average of the median sales price for new and existing homes, and (2) the composite median price of all sales.</P>

                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Annual percentage rate</E> is the measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate, that relates the amount and timing of value received by the mortgagor to the amount and timing of payments made and is the rate required to be disclosed by the mortgagee under 12 CFR 1026.18, pertaining to disclosure of finance charges for mortgages.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Points and fees</E> has the meaning given to “points and fees” in 12 CFR 1026.32(b)(1) as of January 10, 2014.

                  <P>(ii) To rebut the presumption of compliance, it must be proven that the mortgage exceeded the points and fees limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or that, despite the mortgage having been endorsed for insurance under the National Housing Act, the mortgagee did not make a reasonable and good-faith determination of the mortgagor's repayment ability at the time of consummation, by failing to evaluate the mortgagor's income, credit, and assets in accordance with HUD underwriting requirements.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Safe harbor qualified mortgage.</E> (i) A mortgage for manufactured housing that is insured under Title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) is a safe harbor qualified mortgage that meets the ability to repay requirements in 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a); and</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">When is an increased mortgage limit permitted for these areas?</E> For Alaska, Guam, Hawaii or the Virgin Islands, the Commissioner may increase the maximum mortgage amount permitted by section 203(b)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act when authorized by section 214 of that Act, through the procedures described in § 203.18(h).</P>
                  <P>(b) If a party believes that the otherwise applicable mortgage limit needs to be increased to reflect the extent to which high costs make it infeasible to construct dwellings without sacrificing sound standards of construction, design or livability, the party may submit documentation in support of an alternative mortgage limit. This documentation should include actual or estimated costs of such items as design, construction, materials, and labor. In addition, actual sales prices of new homes may be submitted, together with any other documentation requested by the Commissioner. Requests for alternative mortgage limits, together with supporting documentation should be sent to the appropriate HUD field office. The field office will forward the request and supporting material, with the field office's recommendation, to the Commissioner for determination.</P>

                  <P>(c) If the Alaska Housing Authority, or the Government of Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands or any agency or instrumentality of those entities, is the mortgagor or the mortgagee, or the mortgagor is regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation to such an extent and in such manner as the Commissioner determines advisable to provide reasonable rental and sales prices and a reasonable return on the investment, any mortgage otherwise eligible for insurance under this subpart may be insured:<PRTPAGE P="161"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(1) In any case where the Alaska Housing Authority, or the government of Guam, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, or any agency or instrumentality of those entities, is the mortgagor, without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor occupy the dwelling as a principal residence or a secondary residence (as these terms are defined in § 203.18(f)), or meet loan-to-value or comparable limitations based on the failure of the mortgagor to meet this occupancy requirement;</P>
                  <P>(2) Without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor has paid on account of the property a prescribed percentage of the appraised value of the property; or</P>
                  <P>(3) Without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor certify that the mortgaged property is free and clear of all liens other than the mortgage offered for insurance and that there will not be any unpaid obligations contracted in connection with the mortgage transaction or the purchase of the mortgaged property.</P>
                  <P>(d) The provisions of § 203.28 requiring economic soundness shall not be applicable to mortgages covering property located in Alaska, in Guam, in Hawaii, or in the Virgin Islands, but the Commissioner shall find that the property or project is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the acute housing shortage in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands.</P>

                  <P>(b) With prior approval of the Secretary, the mortgaged property may be subject to a secondary mortgage or loan made or insured, or other secondary lien held, by a Federal, State, or local government agency or instrumentality, or an entity designated in the homeownership plan submitted by an applicant for an implementation grant under the Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) program, or an eligible nonprofit organization as defined in § 203.41(a)(5) of this part, provided that the required monthly payments under the insured mortgage and the secondary mortgage or lien shall not exceed the mortgagor's reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary.</P>
                  <P>(c) With the prior approval of the Secretary, the mortgaged property may be subject to a second mortgage held by a mortgagee not described in paragraph (b) of this section. Unless the mortgage is for the purpose described in paragraph (d) of this section, it shall meet the following requirements:</P>
                  <P>(1) The required monthly payments under the insured mortgage and the second mortgage shall not exceed the mortgagor's reasonable ability to pay, as determined by the Commissioner;</P>
                  <P>(2) Periodic payments, if any, shall be collected monthly and be substantially the same;</P>
                  <P>(3) The sum of the principal amount of the insured mortgage and the second mortgage shall not exceed the loan-to-value limitation applicable to the insured mortgage, and shall not exceed the maximum mortgage limit for the area;</P>
                  <P>(4) The repayment terms shall not provide for a balloon payment before ten years, or for such other term as the Commissioner may approve, except that the mortgage may become due and payable on sale or refinancing of the secured property covered by the insured mortgage; and</P>
                  <P>(5) The mortgage shall contain a provision permitting the mortgagor to prepay the mortgage in whole or in part at any time, and shall not provide for the payment of any charge on account of such prepayment.</P>
                  <P>(d)(1) With the prior approval of the Commissioner, the mortgaged property may be subject to a junior (second or third) mortgage securing the repayment of funds advanced to reduce the mortgagor's monthly payments on the insured mortgage following the date it is insured, if the junior mortgage meets the following requirements:</P>
                  <P>(i) The junior mortgage shall not provide for any payment of principal or interest until the property securing the junior mortgage is sold or the insured mortgage is refinanced, at which time the junior mortgage shall become due and payable;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The total amount of repayments under the junior mortgage shall not exceed the least of:</P>
                  <P>(A) One-half of the mortgagor's equity interest in the property at the time of sale or refinancing;</P>
                  <P>(B) Three times the amount of funds advanced to effect the interest rate buy-down; or</P>

                  <P>(C) The sum of the original loan amount plus the total accrued interest <PRTPAGE P="163"/>on the junior mortgage at the time of repayment; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) The junior mortgage shall contain a provision permitting the mortgagor to prepay the mortgage in whole or in part at any time, and shall not provide for the payment of any charge on account of such prepayment. Any full or partial prepayment will not be recoverable by the mortgagor if, by application of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) on sale or refinancing of the property, a lesser amount than the amount prepaid would have been due.</P>
                  <P>(2) The sum of the principal amount of the insured mortgage, any second mortgage made under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and the mortgage securing the repayment of funds advanced to reduce the borrower's monthly payments (whether a second or third mortgage) may exceed the loan-to-value limitation applicable to the insured mortgage, but such sum may not exceed the maximum mortgage limit for the area.</P>

                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Supporting documentation.</E> The mortgagee shall obtain documentation verifying that the seller is the owner of record and must submit this documentation to HUD as part of the application for mortgage insurance, in accordance with § 203.255(b)(12). This documentation may include, but is not limited to, a property sales history report, a copy of the recorded deed from the seller, or other documentation (such as a copy of a property tax bill, title commitment, or binder) demonstrating the seller's ownership.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Time restrictions on re-sales</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The eligibility of a property for a mortgage insured by FHA is dependent on the time that has elapsed between the date the seller acquired the property (based upon the date of <PRTPAGE P="164"/>settlement) and the date of execution of the sales contract that will result in the FHA mortgage insurance (the re-sale date). The mortgagee shall obtain documentation verifying compliance with the time restrictions described in this paragraph and must submit this documentation to HUD as part of the application for mortgage insurance, in accordance with § 203.255(b).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Re-sales occurring 90 days or less following acquisition.</E> If the re-sale date is 90 days or less following the date of acquisition by the seller, the property is not eligible for a mortgage to be insured by FHA.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Re-sales occurring between 91 days and 180 days following acquisition.</E> (i) If the re-sale date is between 91 days and 180 days following acquisition by the seller, the property is generally eligible for a mortgage insured by FHA.</P>
                  <P>(ii) However, HUD will require that the mortgagee obtain additional documentation if the re-sale price is 100 percent over the purchase price. Such documentation must include an appraisal from another appraiser. The mortgagee may also document its loan file to support the increased value by establishing that the increased value results from the rehabilitation of the property.</P>

                  <P>(iii) HUD may revise the level at which additional documentation is required under § 203.37a(b)(3) at 50 to 150 percent over the original purchase price. HUD will revise this level by <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice with a 30 day delayed effective date.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Authority to address property flipping for re-sales occurring between 91 days and 12 months following acquisition.</E> (i) If the re-sale date is more than 90 days after the date of acquisition by the seller, but before the end of the twelfth month after the date of acquisition, the property is eligible for a mortgage to be insured by FHA.</P>
                  <P>(ii) However, HUD may require that the lender provide additional documentation to support the re-sale value of the property if the re-sale price is 5 percent or greater than the lowest sales price of the property during the preceding 12 months (as evidenced by the contract of sale). At HUD's discretion, such documentation must include, but is not limited to, an appraisal from another appraiser. HUD may exclude re-sales of less than a specific dollar amount from the additional value documentation requirements.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If the additional value documentation supports a value of the property that is more than 5 percent lower than the value supported by the first appraisal, the lower value will be used to calculate the maximum mortgage amount under § 203.18. Otherwise, the value supported by the first appraisal will be used to calculate the maximum mortgage amount.</P>

                  <P>(iv) HUD will announce its determination to require additional value documentation through issuance of a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. The requirement for additional value documentation may be established either on a nationwide or regional basis. Further, the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice will specify the percentage increase in the re-sale price that will trigger the need for additional documentation, and will specify the acceptable types of documentation. The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice may also exclude re-sales of less than a specific dollar amount from the additional value documentation requirements. Any such <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, and any subsequent revisions, will be issued at least thirty days before taking effect.</P>
                  <P>(v) The level at which additional documentation is required under § 203.37a(b)(4) shall supersede that under § 203.37a(b)(3).</P>

                  <P>(1) Sales by HUD of Real Estate-Owned (REO) properties under 24 CFR part 291 and of single family assets in revitalization areas pursuant to section 204 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710);</P>
                  <P>(2) Sales by another agency of the United States Government of REO single family properties pursuant to programs operated by these agencies;</P>

                  <P>(3) The mortgage must result in a reduction in regular monthly payments by the mortgagor, except:</P>
                  <P>(i) When a fixed rate mortgage is given to refinance an adjustable rate mortgage held by a mortgagor who is to occupy the dwelling as a principal residence or secondary residence, as these terms are defined in § 203.18(f); or</P>
                  <P>(ii) When refinancing a mortgage for a shorter term will result in an increase in the mortgagor's regular monthly payments of no more than $50.

                  <P>(4) It must be made by a mortgagor whose record of payment on the existing mortgage meets standards established by the Commissioner; and</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Eviction procedures.</E> Before HUD will insure a mortgage on Indian land, the tribe having jurisdiction over such property must certify to the HUD Field Office that it has adopted and will enforce procedures for eviction of defaulted mortgagors where the insured mortgage has been foreclosed.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval of lease and mortgage.</E> The lease must be on a form prescribed by HUD.</P>

                  <P>(1) The mortgage shall be a first lien on the leasehold;</P>

                  <P>(2) The mortgagor and the mortgagee execute a building loan agreement, approved by the Commissioner, setting forth the terms and conditions under which advances will be made;<PRTPAGE P="176"/>

                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Assumption or sale of leasehold.</E> The form of lease must contain a provision requiring tribal consent before any assumption of an existing lease, except where title to the leasehold interest is obtained by the Secretary through foreclosure of the insured mortgage. A mortgagee other than the Secretary must obtain tribal consent before obtaining title through a foreclosure sale. Tribal consent must be obtained on any subsequent transfer from the purchaser, including the Secretary, at foreclosure sale. The lease may not be terminated by the lessor without HUD's approval while the mortgage is insured or held by the Secretary.</P>

Mortgage insurance on cooperative shares under § 203.43c on homes in federally impacted <PRTPAGE P="177"/>areas under § 203.43e is not authorized under this section.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemptions from other regulations.</E> The provisions of subparts I, J, and M of part 200, and § 203.30, to the extent that these provisions would otherwise prohibit preferences in favor of Native Hawaiians in the leasing, sale or other disposition of Hawaiian home lands, do not apply to mortgages insured pursuant to section 247 of the National Housing Act. The first lien requirement contained in § 203.17 also does not apply to mortgages insured pursuant to section 247 of the National Housing Act.</P>

These provisions may require the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to make an initial deposit of funds with HUD and to maintain additional funds in reserve for subsequent deposits with HUD. The initial and subsequent deposits shall be used to pay obligations incurred by HUD in connection with the insurance of mortgages under this section and any associated costs, including refunds of insurance premiums to mortgagors. If the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands agrees to make deposits in amounts acceptable to HUD, then the Secretary may agree to use a portion of the premiums received for insurance of mortgages under this section solely for payment of such obligations and associated costs.</P>

                  <P>A mortgage on a leasehold estate covering a one- to four-family residence located on the Allegany Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians in the State of New York is eligible for insurance if the mortgage meets the requirements of this subpart as modified by this section.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Title.</E> This section applies only to a mortgage which:</P>
                  <P>(1) Does not meet the requirements of § 203.37;</P>
                  <P>(2) Is on a leasehold under a lease with a termination date in February 1991, which provides for renewal in accordance with the Act of February 19, 1875 (18 Stat. 330) and the Act of September 30, 1890 (26 Stat. 558).</P>
                  <FP>A mortgage may not be on a leasehold created by a lease which is executed after the effective date of this section as a renewal or replacement of a lease described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A mortgage may not be secured by any other right of occupancy created in lieu of a leasehold after the effective date of this section by agreement of the Seneca Nation, court order, law or any other means.</FP>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Provisions of mortgage.</E> The Secretary will prescribe special mortgage provisions in the form of a mortgage rider in order better to secure the mortgagee, including:</P>
                  <P>(1) Authorization for the mortgagee to exercise the option of lease renewal if the mortgagor fails to do so, and to recover from the mortgagor authorized expenses incurred to obtain lease renewal; and</P>
                  <P>(2) Making a mortgagor failure to take steps necessary for less renewal an event of default under the mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Secretary agreement with mortgagor.</E> The mortgagor must enter into an agreement with the Secretary and such other parties as the Secretary may require regarding actions to be taken to obtain either a renewal of the lease or a new lease.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification.</E> The borrower must certify that it has received disclosures, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, explaining the status of the lease and the consequences of nonrenewal. The disclosure shall include a discussion of the fact that a mortgagor who does not obtain a lease renewal and loses the right of occupancy will remain liable for the outstanding balance of the mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Purchase for principal residence.</E> The mortgagor must be a purchaser who intends to occupy the property as a principal residence (as defined in § 203.18(f)(1)), or a current owner-occupant refinancing a mortgage which is now due or which will become due before the lease termination date in February 1991.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Relationship of income to housing expense.</E> For purposes of § 203.33(a), the total prospective housing expense shall include the Secretary's estimate of future lease payments during the term of the mortgage rather than lease payments in effect at the time of application.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Suspension of commitments.</E> The Secretary may suspend the issuance of commitments to insure mortgages under this section, for the entire period <PRTPAGE P="179"/>during which commitments could otherwise be issued for insurance under this section (i.e., through February 18, 1991) or for such lesser period as the Secretary may specify, by providing thirty days notice of suspension in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Regardless of its duration, a suspension to be imposed prior to February 19, 1990, will be based on a determination by the Secretary that, for mortgages insured during a specified period, the rate of monetary defaults (as measured by 90 day delinquencies) for mortgages insured under this section exceeds the rate of such monetary defaults for all insured mortgages on one- to four-family properties in the State of New York. A suspension to be imposed after February 18, 1990, will be based on a consideration by the Secretary of the probable costs to the Special Risk Insurance Fund of further commitments to insure under this section, as measured by such factors as the current and projected rate and amount of claims payments, together with other significant current and projected costs as determined by the Secretary, including a review of the actual and projected monetary default rate (as measured by 90 day delinquencies) and the actual and projected rate of lease renewal through negotiation and arbitration.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Interest-rate index.</E> Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond either to changes in the one-year London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or to changes in the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year.

                  <P>(i) One-year adjustable rate mortgages—no sooner than 12 months or later than 18 months;</P>

                  <P>(2) To set the new interest rate, the mortgagee will determine the change between the initial (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> base) index figure and the current index figure, or will add a specific margin to the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment, except that for forward mortgages originated on or after January 10, 2015, 30 days shall mean 45 days.</P>

                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Magnitude of changes.</E> The adjustable rate mortgage initial contract interest rate shall be agreed upon by the mortgagee and the mortgagor. The first adjustment to the contract interest rate shall take place in accordance with the schedule set forth under paragraph (d) of this section. Thereafter, for all adjustable rate mortgages, the adjustment shall be made annually and shall occur on the anniversary date of the first adjustment, subject to the following conditions and limitations:</P>
                  <P>(1) For one- and three-year adjustable rate mortgages, no single adjustment to the interest rate shall result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment for a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Eligibility of rehabilitation loans.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>A rehabilitation loan which meets the requirements of this subpart, except as modified by this section, shall be eligible for insurance under section 203(k) of the National Housing Act.</P>
                  <P>(a) For the purpose of this section:</P>
                  <P>(1) The term <E T="03">rehabilitation loan</E> means a loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing a loan or advancement of credit, made for the purpose of financing:</P>
                  <P>(i) The rehabilitation of an existing one-to-four unit structure which will be used primarily for residential purposes;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The rehabilitation of such a structure and refinancing of the outstanding indebtedness on such structure and the real property on which the structure is located; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) The rehabilitation of such a structure and the purchase of the structure and the real property on which it is located; and</P>
                  <P>(2) The term <E T="03">rehabilitation</E> means the improvement (including improvements designed to meet cost-effective energy conservation standards prescribed by the Secretary and improvements for accessibility to the handicapped) or repair of a structure, or facilities in connection with a structure, and may include the provision of such sanitary or other facilities as are required by applicable codes, a community development plan, or a statewide property insurance plan to be provided by the owner or tenant of the project.</P>
                  <P>(b) The provisions of § 203.18 (except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this section) and § 203.43c shall not apply to loans insured under this section.</P>
                  <P>(c) The loan shall cover a dwelling which was completed more than one year preceding the date of the application for mortgage insurance and which was approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of rehabilitation.</P>
                  <P>(d)(1) The buildings on the mortgaged property must, upon completion of rehabilitation, conform with standards prescribed by the Secretary.</P>
                  <P>(2) Improvements or repairs made under this section must be designed to meet cost-effective energy conservation standards prescribed by the Secretary.</P>
                  <P>(e) The loan transaction shall be an acceptable risk as determined by the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(f) The loan may not exceed an amount which, when added to any outstanding indebtedness of the borrower that is secured by the property, creates an outstanding indebtedness in excess of the lesser of:</P>
                  <P>(1)(i) The limits prescribed in § 203.18(a)(1) (in the case of a dwelling to be occupied as a principal residence, as defined in § 203.18(f)(1));</P>
                  <P>(ii) The limits prescribed in § 203.18(a)(1) and (3) (in the case of a dwelling to be occupied as a secondary residence, as defined in § 203.18(f)(2));</P>
                  <P>(iii) 85 percent of the limits prescribed in § 203.18(c), or such higher limit, not to exceed the limits set forth in § 203.18(a)(1), as Commissioner may prescribe (in the case of an eligible non-occupant mortgagor as defined in § 203.18(f)(3));</P>

                  <P>(iv) The limits prescribed in § 203.18a, based upon the sum of the estimated <PRTPAGE P="183"/>cost of rehabilitation and the Commissioner's estimate of the value of the property before rehabilitation; or</P>
                  <P>(2) The limits prescribed in the authorities listed in this paragraph (f), based upon 110 percent of the Commissioner's estimate of the value of the property after rehabilitation.</P>
                  <P>(g) The loan limitation prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section shall not be applicable where a unit of local government demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that:</P>
                  <P>(1) The property is located within an area which is subject to a community sponsored program of concentrated redevelopment or revitalization, and,</P>
                  <P>(2) The loan limitation prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, prevents the utilization of the program to accomplish rehabilitation in the subject area, and,</P>
                  <P>(3) The interests of the mortgagor and the Commissioner are adequately protected.</P>
                  <P>(h) Insurance may be available for advances made during rehabilitation or upon completion of rehabilitation, according to the procedures in § 203.5, 203.6, or 203.7 (as applicable).</P>
                  <P>(i) Rehabilitation loans which do not involve the insurance of advances, the refinancing of outstanding indebtedness or the purchase of the property need not be a first lien on the property but shall not be junior to any lien other than a first mortgage. The provisions of §§ 203.15, 203.19, 203.23, 203.24, 203.26, and 203.43j shall not be applicable to such loans.</P>
                  <P>(j) The Commissioner may insure advances made by the mortgagee during rehabilitation if the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgage shall be a first lien on the property.</P>
                  <P>(2) The mortgagor and the mortgagee shall execute a rehabilitation loan agreement, approved by the Commissioner, setting forth the terms and conditions under which advances will be made.</P>
                  <P>(3) The advances shall be made as provided in the reliabilitation loan agreement.</P>
                  <P>(4) The principal amount of the mortgage shall be held by the mortgagee in an interest bearing account, trust, or escrow for the benefit of the mortgagor pending advancement to the mortgagor or his creditors as provided in the rehabilitation loan agreement.</P>
                  <P>(5) The loan shall bear interest at the rate prescribed in § 203.20 on the amount advanced to the mortgagor or its creditors, and the amount held in an account or trust for the benefit of the mortgagor.</P>
                  <P>(6) If paragraph (k) of this section applies, the rehabilitation loan agreement shall restrict advancement to the mortgagor, or to creditors other than the mortgagee, so that any loan proceeds in excess of the 85 percent set forth in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section shall not be advanced until the property is sold to a purchaser described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(k) In the case of a dwelling (1) to be occupied neither as a principal residence nor as a secondary residence and (2) where the loan is approved for a limit higher than the 85 percent set forth in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, the eligible non-occupant mortgagor (as defined in § 203.18(f)(3)) shall certify to the Commissioner that:</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgagor will not rent (except for a rental term of not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days), sell (except where the insured mortgage is paid in full as an incident of the sale), or occupy the property before a due date approved by the Commissioner, except with the prior written approval of the Commissioner;</P>
                  <P>(2) The mortgagor agrees that, if the property is not sold before a due date approved by the Commissioner to a purchaser, acceptable to the Commissioner, who will occupy the property, assume personal liability, and agree to pay the mortgage indebtedness, any amount held in escrow, trust, or special account under paragraph (j) of this section will be applied in reduction of the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage as of the due date approved by the Commissioner;</P>

                  <P>(3) The mortgagee agrees that any portion of the fund held in escrow, trust, or special account, not applied to the mortgage in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (k), shall <PRTPAGE P="184"/>be deducted from the amount of the insurance benefits to which the mortgagee would otherwise be entitled if a claim for insurance benefits is filed.</P>
                  <P>(l) <E T="03">Rehabilitation loan consultants.</E> HUD maintains a list of qualified consultants, in accordance with §§ 200.190 through 200.193 of this title. When the borrower elects to use the services of a consultant, the lender must select a consultant on the list to perform one or more of the following tasks:</P>
                  <P>(1) Conduct a preliminary feasibility analysis before or after the submission of a sales contract;</P>
                  <P>(2) Prepare the cost estimate, work write-up, and architectural exhibits required for the rehabilitation of the property;</P>
                  <P>(3) Conduct a plan review; and</P>
                  <P>(4) Conduct the draw inspections for the release of funds during the construction phase of the project.</P>
                  <P>(m) With regard to loans under this section executed on or after December 27, 2005, the Commissioner shall charge an up-front and annual MIP in accordance with 24 CFR 203.284 or 203.285, whichever is applicable.</P>

                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Service contract.</E> Before mortgage closing, the mortgagor must enter into a service contract with an organization or individual specifically approved by the local (or state) health authority to carry out the provisions of the required Plan for servicing, maintenance, repair and replacement of the water purification equipment. A copy of the signed service contract must be provided to HUD.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Escrow for maintenance and replacement.</E> The mortgagee must establish and maintain an escrow account which provides for the accumulation of funds paid with the mortgagor's monthly mortgage payment adequate to assure proper servicing, maintenance, repair and replacement of the water purification equipment. The amount to be collected and escrowed by the mortgagee shall be based upon information provided by the manufacturer for the maintenance and replacement of the water purification equipment and for other charges anticipated by the service contractor. The initial monthly escrow amount shall be stated in the Plan. Disbursements from the account will be limited to costs associated with the normal servicing, maintenance, repair or replacement of the water purification equipment. Disbursements may only be made to the service contractor or its successor, to equipment suppliers, to the local (or state) health authority for the performance of testing or other required services, or to another entity approved by the health authority. So long as water purification remains necessary and the mortgage is insured by HUD, the mortgagee must maintain the escrow account.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Approved Plan.</E> A Plan, in the form of a contract entered into by the mortgagor and mortgagee and approved by the local (or state) health authority, must set out conditions that must be <PRTPAGE P="186"/>met by the parties as a condition to insurance of the mortgage by HUD. To be approved by the health authority:</P>
                  <P>(1) The Plan must set forth the respective responsibilities to be assumed by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, as well as the other entities who will implement the Plan, i.e., the health authority and the service contractor. In particular:</P>
                  <P>(i) The Plan must set out the responsibilities of the health authority for monitoring and enforcing performance of the service contractor, including any successor contractor that the health authority may later have occasion to name. By its approval of the Plan, the health authority documents its acceptance of these responsibilities, and the Plan should so indicate;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The Plan must provide for the monitoring of the operation of the water purification equipment, as well as for servicing (including disinfecting), and for repairing and replacing the system, as frequently as necessary, taking into consideration the system's design, anticipated use, and the type and level of contaminants present. Installation, servicing, repair and replacement of the water purification system must be performed by an individual or organization approved for the purpose by the local (or state) health authority and identified in the Plan. In meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the Plan may incorporate by reference specific terms and conditions of the service contract required under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Under the Plan, responsibility for monitoring the performance of the service contractor and for assuring that the water purification system is properly serviced, repaired, and replaced rests with the local (or state) health authority that has given its approval to the Plan. The Plan must confer on the health authority all powers necessary to effect compliance by the service contractor. The health authority's powers shall include the authority to notify the mortgagor of any noncompliance by the service contractor. The plan must provide that, upon any notification of noncompliance received from the health authority, the mortgagor shall have the right to discharge the service contractor for cause and to appoint a successor organization or individual as service contractor; and</P>
                  <P>(iv) The Plan must provide for the mortgagor to make periodic escrow payments necessary for the servicing, maintenance, repair and replacement of the water purification system, and for the mortgagee to disburse funds from the escrow account as required, to the appropriate party or parties.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Plan must provide that if the dwelling served by the water purification system is refinanced, or is sold or otherwise transferred with a HUD-insured mortgage, the Plan will:</P>
                  <P>(i) Continue in full force and effect;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Impose an obligation on the mortgagor to notify any subsequent purchaser or transferee of the necessity for the water purification system and for its proper maintenance, and of the obligation to make escrow payments; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) Require the mortgagor to furnish the purchaser with a copy of the Plan, before any sales contract is signed.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Periodic analysis.</E> Any Plan developed in accordance with this section must provide that an analysis of the water supply shall be obtained from the local (or state) health authority no less frequently than annually, but more frequently, if determined at any time to be necessary by the health authority or by the service contractor.</P>

In addition, such amendment will not adversely affect the eligibility of specific property if such property is covered by a conditional commitment issued by the Secretary, a certificate of reasonable value issued by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or an appraisal report approved by a Direct Endorsement or Lender Insurance underwriter.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Mortgages with firm commitments.</E> For applications for insurance involving mortgages not eligible to be originated under the Direct Endorsement program under § 203.5, or under the Lender Insurance program under § 203.6, the Secretary will either endorse the mortgage for insurance by issuing a Mortgage Insurance Certificate, provided that the mortgagee is in compliance with the firm commitment, or will electronically acknowledge that the mortgage has been insured.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Endorsement with Direct Endorsement processing.</E> For applications for insurance involving mortgages originated under the Direct Endorsement program under § 203.5, the mortgagee shall submit to the Secretary, within 60 days after the date of closing of the loan or such additional time as permitted by the Secretary, properly completed documentation and certifications as listed in this paragraph (b):</P>

                  <P>(3) A certified copy of the mortgage and note executed upon forms which meet the requirements of the Secretary;</P>

                  <P>(5) An underwriter certification, on a form prescribed by the Secretary, stating that the underwriter has personally reviewed the appraisal report and credit application (including the analysis performed on the worksheets) and that the proposed mortgage complies with HUD underwriting requirements, and incorporates each of the underwriter certification items that apply to the mortgage submitted for endorsement, as set forth in the applicable handbook or similar publication that is distributed to all Direct Endorsement mortgagees, except that where the TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard is used by the mortgagee, and the TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard has determined that the application represents an acceptable risk under terms and conditions agreed to by the FHA, a Direct Endorsement underwriter shall not be required to certify that the underwriter has personally reviewed the credit application (including the analysis performed on any worksheets). The following requirements are also applicable to the use of the TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard:</P>
                  <P>(i) Mortgagees and vendors must certify to compliance with these requirements:</P>
                  <P>(A) <E T="03">Permissible users.</E> Only automatic underwriting systems (AUSs) developed, operated, owned, or used by FHA-approved Direct Endorsement mortgagees, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, may access TOTAL, and only FHA-approved mortgagees will be able to obtain risk-assessments using TOTAL;</P>
                  <P>(B) <E T="03">Limitation on use.</E> Results from TOTAL must not be used as the basis for rejecting any mortgage applicant. Mortgagees must provide full manual underwriting for mortgage applicants when TOTAL returns a “refer” risk score.</P>

                  <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Not use TOTAL to direct mortgagors into other non-FHA product offerings (this requirement does not relieve a mortgagee from its obligations under § 203.10 concerning informed consumer choice for prospective FHA mortgagors);</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Not disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, derive or otherwise reproduce any part of the source code or algorithm in TOTAL;<PRTPAGE P="189"/>

                  <P>(A) <E T="03">Notice.</E> HUD will provide a mortgagee or vendor with a 30-day notice of a violation and loss of privilege. The notice will state the nature of the violation, the effective date of the loss of the privilege, and the duration of the loss of the privilege. The notice will become effective on the date provided in the notice, unless the mortgagee or vendor appeals the violation and loss of privilege in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(B) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> A party receiving a notice of violation may appeal to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing (DAS-SFH), or his or her designee, before the effective date of the notice by providing evidence to refute the violation. The loss of privilege is stayed until the DAS-SFH, or designee, notifies the party that the loss of privilege has been affirmed, rescinded, or modified.</P>
                  <P>(6) Where applicable, a certificate under oath and contract regarding use of the dwelling for transient or hotel purposes;</P>
                  <P>(7) Where applicable, a certificate of intent to occupy by military personnel;</P>
                  <P>(8) Where a mortgage for an existing property is to be insured under section 221(d)(2) of the National Housing Act, a letter from the appropriate local government official that the property meets applicable code requirements;</P>

                  <P>(10) For proposed construction if the mortgage (excluding financed mortgage insurance premium) exceeds a 90 percent loan to value ratio, evidence that the mortgagee qualifies for a higher ratio loan under one of the applicable provisions in the appropriate regulations;</P>
                  <P>(11) A mortgage certification on a form prescribed by the Secretary, stating that the authorized representative of the mortgagee who is making the certification has personally reviewed the mortgage documents and the application for insurance endorsement, and certifying that the mortgage complies with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The certification shall incorporate each of the mortgagee certification items that apply to the mortgage loan submitted for endorsement, as set forth in the applicable handbook or similar publication that is distributed to all Direct Endorsement mortgagees;</P>
                  <P>(12) For a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage under part 206 of this chapter, the additional documents required by § 206.15 of this chapter; and</P>
                  <P>(13) The documentation required under § 203.37a providing that:</P>
                  <P>(i) The seller is the owner of record; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) That more than 90 days elapsed between the date the seller acquired the property (based upon the date of settlement) and the date of execution of the sales contract that will result in the FHA mortgage insurance.</P>
                  <P>(14) Such other documents as the Secretary may require.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Pre-endorsement review for Direct Endorsement.</E> Upon submission by an approved mortgagee of the documents required by paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will review the documents and determine that:</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgage is executed on a form which meets the requirements of the Secretary;</P>
                  <P>(2) The mortgage maturity meets the requirements of the applicable program;</P>

                  <P>(3) The stated mortgage amount does not exceed the maximum mortgage amount for the area as most recently <PRTPAGE P="190"/>announced by the Secretary, except for mortgages under 24 CFR part 206;</P>
                  <P>(4) All documents required by paragraph (b) of this section are submitted;</P>
                  <P>(5) All necessary certifications are made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
                  <P>(6) There is no mortgage insurance premium, late charge or interest due to the Secretary; and</P>
                  <P>(7) The mortgage was not in default when submitted for insurance or, if submitted for insurance more than 60 days after closing whether the mortgage shows an acceptable payment history.</P>
                  <FP>In addition, the Secretary is authorized to determine if there is any information indicating that any certification or required document is false, misleading, or constitutes fraud or misrepresentation on the part of any party, or that the mortgage fails to meet a statutory or regulatory requirement. If, following this review, the mortgage is determined to be eligible, the Secretary will endorse the mortgage for insurance by issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate. If the mortgage is determined to be ineligible, the Secretary will inform the mortgagee in writing of this determination, and include the reasons for the determination and any corrective actions that may be taken.</FP>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission by mortgagee other than originating mortgagee.</E> If the originating mortgagee assigns the mortgage to another approved mortgagee before pre-endorsement review under paragraph (c) of this section, the assignee may submit the required documents for pre-endorsement review in the name of the originating mortgagee. All certifications must be executed by the originating mortgagee (or its underwriter, if appropriate). The purchasing mortgagee may pay any required mortgage insurance premium, late charge and interest.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Post-Endorsement review for Direct Endorsement.</E> Following endorsement for insurance, the Secretary may review all documents required by paragraph (b) of this section. If, following this review, the Secretary determines that the mortgage does not satisfy the requirements of the Direct Endorsement program, the Secretary may place the mortgagee on Direct Endorsement probation, or terminate the authority of the mortgagee to participate in the Direct Endorsement program pursuant to § 203.3(d), or refer the matter to the Mortgagee Review Board for action pursuant to part 25 of this title.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Lender insurance</E>—(1)<E T="03">Pre-insurance review.</E> For applications for insurance involving mortgages originated under the Lender Insurance program under § 203.6, the mortgagee is responsible for performing a pre-insurance review that would otherwise be performed by HUD under § 203.255(c) on the documents that would otherwise be submitted to HUD under § 203.255(b). The mortgagee's staff that performs the pre-insurance review must not be the same staff that originated the mortgage or underwrote the mortgage for insurance.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> Mortgagees must maintain records, including origination files, in a manner and for a time period to be prescribed by the Assistant Secretary for Housing—Federal Housing Commissioner, and must make them available to authorized HUD staff upon request.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Insuring the mortgage.</E> If, following this review, the mortgage is determined to be eligible, the mortgagee will electronically submit all required data to HUD regarding the mortgage. HUD's electronic system will acknowledge that the mortgage has been insured. HUD's electronic system may also issue a notice to the mortgagee that the mortgage has been selected for post-insurance technical review, and that the HUD case binder must be sent to the identified HUD office.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Indemnification</E>—(1)<E T="03">General.</E> By insuring the mortgage, a Lender Insurance mortgagee agrees to indemnify HUD, in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of origination.</E> For purposes of indemnification under this paragraph, the term “origination” means the process of creating a mortgage, starting with the taking of the initial application, continuing with the processing and underwriting, and ending with the mortgagee endorsing the mortgage note for FHA insurance.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Serious and material violation.</E> The mortgagee shall indemnify HUD for an FHA insurance claim paid within 5 <PRTPAGE P="191"/>years of mortgage insurance endorsement, if the mortgagee knew or should have known of a serious and material violation of FHA origination requirements, such that the mortgage loan should not have been approved and endorsed by the mortgagee and irrespective of whether the violation caused the mortgage default. Such a serious and material violation of FHA requirements in the origination of the mortgage may occur if the mortgagee failed to, among other actions:</P>
                  <P>(i) Verify the creditworthiness, income, and/or employment of the mortgagor in accordance with FHA requirements;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Verify the assets brought by the mortgagor for payment of the required down payment and/or closing costs in accordance with FHA requirements; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) Address property deficiencies identified in the appraisal affecting the health and safety of the occupants or the structural integrity of the property in accordance with FHA requirements, or</P>
                  <P>(iv) Ensure that the appraisal of the property serving as security for the mortgage loan satisfies FHA appraisal requirements, in accordance with § 203.5(e).</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Fraud or misrepresentation.</E> The mortgagee shall indemnify HUD for an insurance claim if the mortgagee knew or should have known that fraud or misrepresentation was involved in connection with the origination of the mortgage, regardless of whether the fraud or misrepresentation caused the mortgage default and regardless of when an insurance claim is filed.</P>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Demand for indemnification.</E> The demand for indemnification will be made by either the Secretary or the Mortgagee Review Board. Under indemnification, the Lender Insurance mortgagee agrees to either abstain from filing an insurance claim, or reimburse FHA if a subsequent holder of the mortgage files an insurance claim and FHA suffers a financial loss.</P>

The agreement shall contain a provision for the resumption of monthly payments after such period in amounts which will completely amortize the mortgage debt within the maturity as provided in the original mortgage. The agreement shall in no way affect the amount of the annual MIP which will continue to be calculated in accordance with the original amortization provisions of the mortgage.</P>

No postponement or delay in the prosecution of foreclosure proceedings during the period the mortgagor is in such military service shall be construed as failure on the part of the mortgagee to exercise reasonable diligence in prosecuting such proceedings to completion as required by this subpart.</P>

                  <P>(a)(1) The requirements of this section apply to any insured mortgage subject to this subpart which was either insured pursuant to:</P>
                  <P>(i) A conditional commitment issued on or after November 30, 1983 or, as appropriate,</P>
                  <P>(ii) An application for mortgage insurance endorsement under the Single Family Direct Endorsement Program, as provided in § 203.255(b), where the property appraisal report was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 30, 1983.</P>
                  <P>(2) The requirements of this section shall also apply to any other mortgages subject to this subpart where the mortgagee elects to provide the notice to HUD required by paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the requirements of this section do not apply if the mortgaged property has been damaged as set out in § 203.378.</P>
                  <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall affect any rights or obligations arising under the procedures set forth in subpart C of this part.</P>
                  <P>(d) After initiating proceedings to foreclose an insured mortgage within the coverage of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by judicial, statutory, or other means authorized by the mortgage instrument, the mortgagee shall furnish notice of the foreclosure to the Commissioner, containing such information as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner, together with a copy of the notice of sale, on or before the date of first publication, posting, or other notice. The mortgagee foreclosing an insured mortgage subject to this subpart and within the coverage of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may elect to become subject to this section by providing such notices to the Commissioner in accordance with the preceding sentence.</P>
                  <P>(e) Where notice of the foreclosure sale is provided pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the Commissioner may elect to cause the mortgaged property to be appraised and to give written notice to the mortgagee, not less than five days prior to the date of the foreclosure sale, of the Commissioner's estimate of the fair market value of the mortgaged property, less adjustments as the Commissioner may deem appropriate (which may include, without limitation, the Commissioner's estimate of holding costs and resale costs that would be incurred if title to the mortgaged property were conveyed to the Commissioner). Such amount is referred to hereafter as the “Commissioner's adjusted fair market value.”</P>

                  <P>(f) If the Commissioner fails to provide notice of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value to the mortgagee not less than five days prior to the scheduled date of foreclosure sale, this section shall have no further application and §§ 203.355 through 203.367 shall apply: <E T="03">Provided,</E> that a mortgagee which receives the Commissioner's notice at any time prior to the foreclosure sale may waive late receipt by so notifying the Commissioner, in which case this section shall apply.</P>
                  <P>(g) If the Commissioner provides notice of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section the following shall be applicable:</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgagee shall tender a bid at the foreclosure sale in the amount of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value.</P>

                  <P>(2) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale in an amount <PRTPAGE P="209"/>equal to the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the mortgagee may elect to retain title to the property and to file a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(b).</P>
                  <P>(3) If a party other than the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property either pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale or through the redemption of the property in an amount not less than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the mortgagee may file a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(b).</P>
                  <P>(4) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale in an amount in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the mortgagee is deemed to have elected to retain title to the property and is limited to filing a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(b). In the event the mortgagee can show good cause for having bid an amount in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the Commissioner may, at his discretion, waive the provisions of this subparagraph and allow the mortgagee to convey title to the Commissioner and file a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(a). A mortgagee which has elected to follow the provisions of this section pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section and bids an amount in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value shall not be subject to the provisions of this subparagraph, and may elect to retain or convey title in filing a claim for the insurance benefits.</P>
                  <P>(5) In any other case, the mortgagee may file a claim for insurance benefits only upon conveyance of title to the mortgaged property to the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(h) If the Commissioner provides timely notice of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value in accordance with paragraph (e), the Commissioner may require the mortgagee to advertise the upcoming sale in addition to the standard legal notices which may be required by state law.</P>
                  <P>(i) Where a mortgagee files a claim for the insurance benefits without conveying title to the property to the Commissioner, as authorized by this section:</P>
                  <P>(1) Sections 203.358 through 203.367 shall not be applicable.</P>
                  <P>(2) The mortgagee shall assign to the Commissioner, without recourse or warranty, any or all claims which the mortgagee has acquired in connection with the mortgage transaction and as a result of the foreclosure proceedings or other means by which the mortgagee or party other than the mortgagee acquired such property, except such claims as may have been released with the approval of the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(3) The mortgagee shall forward to the Commissioner:</P>
                  <P>(i) Fiscal data pertaining to the mortgage transaction;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The original credit and security instruments, if available, or a deficiency judgment, if any, duly assigned or endorsed by the mortgagee, without recourse, to the Commissioner; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) Any additional information or data which the Commissioner may require.</P>
                  <P>(4) The mortgagee shall retain all cash amounts held or deposited for the account of the mortgagor or to which the mortgagee is entitled under the mortgage transaction that have not been applied in reduction of the principal mortgage indebtedness. Cash amounts shall be itemized and deducted from the claim pursuant to § 203.403. Receipts for disbursements are to be retained by the mortgagee and are to be made available upon request by the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(5) The mortgagee shall file its claim:</P>
                  <P>(i) Within 30 days after the mortgagee acquired good marketable title to the property; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) Within 30 days after a party other than the mortgagee acquired good marketable title to the property; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) In redemption States, within 30 days after the mortgagor or another party redeemed the property or the redemption period has expired; or</P>
                  <P>(iv) Within such other time as may be determined by the Commissioner.</P>

                  <P>(6) In any case in which the insurance benefits paid include, pursuant to § 203.402(c), hazard insurance premiums paid by the mortgagee, the portion of the hazard insurance premium allocable to the period after acquisition of <PRTPAGE P="210"/>title by the mortgagee or a third party shall be deducted from the mortgage insurance benefits otherwise payable.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Adjustment for damage or neglect.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) If the property has been damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or, for mortgages insured on or after January 1, 1977, the property has suffered damage because of the mortgagee's failure to take action as required by § 203.377, the damage must be repaired before conveyance of the property or assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary, except under the following conditions:</P>
                  <P>(1) If the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained, there will be deducted from the insurance benefits the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repairing the damage or any insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, whichever is greater.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the property has been damaged by fire and was not covered by fire insurance at the time of the damage, or the amount of insurance coverage was inadequate to repair fully the damage, only the amount of insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, if any, will be deducted from the insurance benefits, provided the mortgagee certifies, at the time that a claim is filed for insurance benefits, that:</P>
                  <P>(i) At the time the mortgage was insured, the property was covered by fire insurance in an amount at least equal to the lesser of 100 percent of the insurable value of the improvements, or the principal loan balance of the mortgage; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) The insurer later cancelled this coverage or refused to renew it for reasons other than nonpayment of premium; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) The mortgagee made diligent though unsuccessful efforts within 30 days of any cancellation or non-renewal of hazard insurance, and at least annually thereafter, to secure other coverage or coverage under a FAIR Plan, in an amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or if coverage to such an extent was unavailable at a reasonable rate, the greatest extent of coverage that was available at a reasonable rate; and</P>

                  <P>(iv) The extent of coverage obtained by the mortgagee in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section was the greatest available at a reasonable rate, or if the mortgagee was unable to <PRTPAGE P="213"/>obtain insurance, none was available at a reasonable rate; and</P>
                  <P>(v) The mortgagee took the actions required by § 203.377 of this part.</P>
                  <P>(3) The certification requirements set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to any mortgage insured by HUD on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has not been filed before September 30, 1986. Any mortgage insured on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has been filed before September 30, 1986, but the claim has not been settled before that date, will be governed by § 203.379(b) (1986) Edition as it existed immediately before September 30, 1986.</P>
                  <P>(4)(i) As used in this section, <E T="03">reasonable rate</E> means a rate that is not in excess of the rate or advisory rate set by the principal State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, or if coverage is available under a FAIR Plan, the FAIR Plan rate.</P>
                  <P>(ii) If a State has neither a FAIR Plan nor a State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, the mortgagee must provide to the HUD Field Office having jurisdiction, information concerning the lowest rates available from an insurer for the types of coverage involved, with a request for a determination of whether the rate is reasonable. HUD will determine the rate to be reasonable if it approximates the rate assessed for comparable insurance coverage applicable to similarly situated properties in a State that offers a FAIR Plan or maintains a State-licensed rating organization.</P>
                  <P>(b) For mortgages insured under firm commitments issued on or after November 19, 1992, or under direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 19, 1992, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply and, in addition, if the property has been damaged during the time of the mortgagee's possession by events other than fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or if it was damaged notwithstanding reasonable action by the mortgagee as required by § 203.377 of this part, the mortgagee must provide notice of such damage to the Secretary and may not convey until directed to do so by the Secretary. The Secretary will either:</P>
                  <P>(1) Allow the mortgagee to convey the property damaged; or</P>
                  <P>(2) Require the mortgagee to repair the damage before conveyance, and the Secretary will reimburse the mortgagee for reasonable payments not in excess of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair, less any insurance recovery.</P>
                  <P>(c) In the event the damaged property is conveyed to the Secretary without prior notice or approval as provided in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary may:</P>
                  <P>(1) After notice, reconvey the property to the mortgagee and the mortgagee must reimburse the Secretary in accordance with §§ 203.363 and 203.364 of this part, or</P>
                  <P>(2) Require the mortgagee to reimburse the Secretary for the greater of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair or any insurance recovery.</P>

                  <P>(b) All mortgagors must be informed of the system available for obtaining answers to loan inquiries, the office from which needed information may be obtained and reminded of the system at least annually. Toll-free telephone service need not be provided to a mortgagor other than at the office designated to serve the mortgagor nor other than from the immediate vicinity of the security property.</P>
                  <P>(c) Within thirty days after the end of each calendar year, the mortgagee shall furnish to the mortgagor a statement of the interest paid, and of the taxes disbursed from the escrow account during the preceding year.

                  <P>(i) The purchasing mortgagor has assumed personal liability by agreeing to pay the mortgage debt;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Five years have elapsed after the assumption; and</P>

                  <P>(2) If the conditions of this paragraph (b) for a release are satisfied, the mortgagee shall provide a written release upon request to the selling mortgagor.</P>
                  <P>(3) This paragraph (b) only applies to a mortgage originated pursuant to an application by the mortgagor on or after December 1, 1986 on a form approved by the Secretary.</P>

                  <P>(a) It is the mortgagee's responsibility to make escrow disbursements before bills become delinquent. Mortgagees must establish controls to insure that bills payable from the escrow fund or the information needed to pay such bills is obtained on a timely basis. Penalties for late payments for items payable from the escrow account must not be charged to the mortgagor unless it can be shown that the penalty was the direct result of the mortgagor's error or omission. The mortgagee shall use the procedures set forth in § 3500.17 of this title, implementing Section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2609), to compute the amount of the escrow, the methods of collection and accounting, and the payment of the bills for which the money has been escrowed.</P>

                  <P>(c) In the case of escrow accounts created for purposes of § 203.52 or § 234.64 of this chapter, mortgagees may estimate escrow requirements based on the best information available as to probable payments that will be required to be made from the account on a periodic basis throughout the period during which the account is maintained.</P>
                  <P>(d) The mortgagee shall not institute foreclosure when the only default of the mortgagor occupant is a present inability to pay a substantial escrow shortage, resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this section, in a lump sum.</P>
                  <P>(e) When the contract of mortgage insurance is terminated voluntarily or because of prepayment in full, sums in the escrow account to pay the mortgage insurance premiums shall be remitted to HUD with a form approved by the Secretary for reporting the voluntary termination of prepayment. Upon prepayment in full sums held in escrow for taxes and hazard insurance shall be released to the mortgagor promptly.</P>

                  <P>(a) A mortgagee shall not commence foreclosure when the only default on the part of the mortgagor is the failure to pay a late charge or charges (§ 203.25), except as provided in § 203.556.</P>
                  <P>(b) A late charge attributable to a particular installment payment due under the mortgage shall not be deducted from that installment. However, if the mortgagee thereafter notifies the mortgagor of his obligation to pay a late charge, such a charge may be deducted from any subsequent payment or payments submitted by the mortgagor or on his behalf if this is not inconsistent with the terms of the mortgage. Partial payments shall be treated as provided in § 203.556.</P>
                  <P>(c) A payment may be returned because of failure to include a late charge only if the mortgagee notifies the mortgagor before imposition of the charge of the amount of the monthly payment, the date when the late charge will be imposed and either the amount of the late charge or the total amount due when the late charge is included.</P>
                  <P>(d) During the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of a mortgage, a late charge shall not be imposed on the mortgagor with respect to any payment on the loan. No payment shall be treated as late for any other purpose if the payment is received by the transferor servicer, rather than the transferee servicer that should receive the payment, before the due date (including any applicable grace period allowed under the mortgage documents) applicable to such payment.</P>

                  <P>(a) For the purpose of this section, a partial payment is a payment of any amount less than the full amount due under the terms of the mortgage at the time the payment is tendered, including late charges.</P>

                  <P>(b) Except as provided in this section, the mortgagee shall accept any partial payment and either apply it to the mortgagor's account or identify it with the mortgagor's account and hold it in a trust account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment they shall be applied to the mortgagor's account, thus advancing <PRTPAGE P="240"/>the date of the oldest unpaid installment but not the date on which the account first became delinquent.</P>
                  <P>(c) If the mortgage is not in default, a partial payment may be returned to the mortgagor with a letter of explanation.</P>

                  <P>(1) When payment aggregates less than 50 percent of the amount then due;</P>
                  <P>(2) The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a forbearance plan, whether or not reduced to writing;</P>
                  <P>(3) The property is occupied by a tenant who is paying rent and the rentals are not being applied to the mortgage payments;</P>
                  <P>(4) Foreclosure has been commenced. (Foreclosure is commenced when the first action required for foreclosure under applicable law is taken.)</P>
                  <P>(e) Under the following circumstances the mortgagee may return any partial payment received more than 14 days after the mortgagee has mailed to the mortgagor a statement of the full amount due, including late charges, and a notice of intention to return any payment less than such amount.</P>
                  <P>(1) Four or more monthly installments are due and unpaid, or</P>
                  <P>(2) A delinquency of any amount has continued for at least six months since the account first became delinquent.</P>

The mortgagee shall not require 30 days' advance notice of prepayment, even if the mortgage instrument purports to require such notice.

If the installment due date (the first day of the month) falls on a nonbusiness day, the mortgagor's notice of intention to prepay or the prepayment shall be timely if received on the next business day.</P>
                  <P>(2) With respect to FHA mortgages insured on or after August 2, 1985, but closed before January 21, 2015, the mortgagee shall not require 30 days' advance notice of prepayment, even if the mortgage instrument purports to require such notice. If the prepayment is offered on other than an installment due date, the mortgagee may refuse to accept the prepayment until the next installment due date (the first day of the month), or may require payment of interest to that date, but only if the mortgagee so advises the mortgagor, in a form approved by the Commissioner, in response to the mortgagor's inquiry, request for payoff figures, or tender of prepayment.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Duty to mitigate.</E> Before four full monthly installments due on the mortgage have become unpaid, the mortgagee shall evaluate on a monthly basis all of the loss mitigation techniques provided at § 203.501 to determine which is appropriate. Based upon such evaluations, the mortgagee shall take the appropriate loss mitigation action. Documentation must be maintained for the initial and all subsequent evaluations and resulting loss mitigation actions. Should a claim for mortgage insurance benefits later be filed, the mortgagee shall maintain this documentation in the claim review file under the requirements of § 203.365(c).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Assessment of mortgagee's loss mitigation performance.</E> (1) HUD will measure and advise mortgagees of their loss mitigation performance through the Tier Ranking System (TRS). Under the TRS, HUD will analyze each mortgagee's loss mitigation efforts portfolio-wide on a quarterly basis, based on 12 months of performance, by computing ratios involving loss mitigation attempts, defaults, and claims. Based on the ratios, HUD will group mortgagees in four tiers (Tiers 1, 2, 3, and 4), with Tier 1 representing the highest or best ranking mortgagees and Tier 4 representing the lowest or least satisfactory ranking mortgagees. The precise methodology for calculating the TRS ratios and for determining the tier stratification (or cutoff points) will be provided through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. Notice of future TRS methodology or stratification changes will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and will provide a 30-day public comment period.</P>
                  <P>(2) Before HUD issues each quarterly TRS notice, HUD will review the number of claims paid to the mortgagee. If HUD determines that the lender's low TRS score is the result of a small number of defaults or a small number of foreclosure claims, or both, as defined by notice, HUD may determine not to designate the mortgagee as Tier 3 or Tier 4, and the mortgagee will remain unranked.</P>
                  <P>(3) Within 30 calendar days after the date of the TRS notice, a mortgagee that scored in Tier 4 may appeal its ranking to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family or the Deputy Assistant Secretary's designee and request an informal HUD conference. The only basis for appeal by the Tier 4 mortgagee is disagreement with the data used by HUD to calculate the mortgagee's ranking. If HUD determines that the mortgagee's Tier 4 ranking was based on incorrect or incomplete data, the mortgagee's performance will be recalculated and the mortgagee will receive a corrected tier ranking score.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment of civil money penalty.</E> A mortgagee that is found to have failed to engage in loss mitigation as required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be liable for a civil money penalty as provided in § 30.35(c) of this title.</P>

                  <P>(a) Before initiating foreclosure, the mortgagee must ensure that all servicing requirements of this subpart have been met. The mortgagee may not commence foreclosure for a monetary default unless at least three full monthly installments due under the mortgage are unpaid after application of any partial payments that may have <PRTPAGE P="243"/>been accepted but not yet applied to the mortgage account. In addition, prior to initiating any action required by law to foreclose the mortgage, the mortgagee shall notify the mortgagor in a format prescribed by the Secretary that the mortgagor is in default and the mortgagee intends to foreclose unless the mortgagor cures the default.</P>
                  <P>(b) If the mortgagee determines that any of the following conditions has been met, the mortgagee may initiate foreclosure without the delay in foreclosure required by paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgaged property has been abandoned, or has been vacant for more than 60 days.</P>
                  <P>(2) The mortgagor, after being clearly advised of the options available for relief, has clearly stated in writing that he or she has no intention of fulfilling his or her obligation under the mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(3) The mortgaged property is not the mortgagor's principal residence and it is occupied by tenants who are paying rent, but the rental income is not being applied to the mortgage debt.</P>

                  <P>(a) It is HUD's policy to reduce the inventory of acquired properties in a manner that expands homeownership opportunities, strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures a maximum return to the mortgage insurance fund.</P>
                  <P>(b) The Secretary will accept conveyance of an occupied property containing one to four residential units if the Secretary finds that:</P>
                  <P>(1) An individual residing in the property suffers from a temporary, permanent, or long-term illness or injury that would be aggravated by the process of moving from the property, and that the individual meets the eligibility criteria in § 203.674(a);</P>
                  <P>(2) State or local law prohibits the mortgagee from evicting a tenant residing in the property who is making regular monthly payments to the mortgagor, or prohibits eviction for other similar reasons beyond the control of the mortgagee; or</P>
                  <P>(3) It is in the Secretary's interest to accept conveyance of the property occupied under § 203.671, the property is habitable as defined in § 203.673, and, except for conveyances under § 203.671(d), each occupant who intends to remain in the property after the conveyance meets the eligibility criteria in § 203.674(b).</P>
                  <P>(c) HUD consents to accept good marketable title to occupied property where 90 days have elapsed since the mortgagee notified HUD of pending acquisition, the Department has notified the mortgagee that it was considering a request for continued occupancy, and no subsequent notification from HUD has been received by the mortgagee.</P>

                  <P>It is in the Secretary's interest to accept occupied conveyance when one or more of the following are met:</P>
                  <P>(a) Occupancy of the property is essential to protect it from vandalism from time of acquisition to the time of preparation for sale.</P>
                  <P>(b) The average time in inventory for HUD's unsold inventory in the residential area in which the property is located exceeds six months.</P>
                  <P>(c) With respect to multi-unit properties, the marketability of the property would be improved by retaining occupancy of one or more units.</P>
                  <P>(d) The high cost of eviction or relocation expenses makes eviction impractical.</P>

                  <P>(a) For the purposes of occupied conveyance considerations, a residential area is any area which constitutes a local economic market for the purchase and sale of residential real estate. In making determinations of residential areas, substantial weight shall be given to delineations of such areas commonly used by persons active in the real estate industry in the affected area.</P>

                  <P>(b) HUD shall establish such residential areas within six (6) months of the publication of these regulations when HUD's current established patterns of <PRTPAGE P="245"/>dealing with the disposition of its acquired home property inventory and related recordkeeping does not coincide with paragraph (a) of this section. Under such circumstances the Secretary shall apply such established patterns in defining residential areas until the standards in paragraph (a) of this section are implemented.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Habitability.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) For purposes of § 203.670, a property is habitable if it meets the requirements of this section in its present condition, or will meet these requirements with the expenditure of not more than five percent of the fair market value of the property. The cost of hazard reduction or abatement of lead-based paint hazards in the property, as required by the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), and the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations in part 35 of this title, is excluded from these repair cost limitations.</P>
                  <P>(b)(1) Each residential unit must contain:</P>
                  <P>(i) Heating facilities adequate for healthful and comfortable living conditions, taking into consideration the local climate;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Adequate electrical supply for lighting and for equipment used in the residential unit;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Adequate cooking facilities;</P>
                  <P>(iv) A continuing supply of hot and cold water; and</P>
                  <P>(v) Adequate sanitary facilities and a safe method of sewage disposal.</P>
                  <P>(2) The property shall be structurally sound, reasonably durable, and free from hazards that may adversely affect the health and safety of the occupants or may impair the customary use and enjoyment by the occupants. Unacceptable hazards include, but are not limited to, subsidence, erosion, flood, exposure to the elements, exposed or unsafe electrical wiring, or an accumulation of minor hazards, such as broken stairs.</P>
                  <P>(c) If repairs, including lead-based paint hazard reduction or abatement, are to be made while the property is occupied, the occupant must hold the Secretary and the Department harmless against any personal injury or property damage that may occur during the process of making repairs. If temporary relocation of the occupant is necessary during repairs, no reimbursement for relocation expenses will be provided to the occupant.</P>

                  <P>(1) A timely request is made in accordance with § 203.676, including the submittal of documents required in § 203.675(b)(4).</P>
                  <P>(2) The occupant agrees to execute a month-to-month lease, at the time of acquisition of the property by the Secretary and on a form prescribed by HUD, and to pay a fair market rent as determined by the Secretary. The rental rate shall be established on the basis of rents charged for other properties in comparable condition after completion of repairs (if any).</P>
                  <P>(3) The occupant's total housing cost (rent plus utility costs to be paid by the occupant) will not exceed 38 percent of the occupant's net effective income (gross income less Federal income taxes). However, a higher percentage may be permitted if the occupant has been paying at least the required rental amount for the dwelling, or if there are other compensating factors (e.g., where the occupant is able to rely on cash savings or on contributions from family members to cover total housing costs).</P>
                  <P>(4) The occupant agrees to allow access to the property (during normal business hours and upon a minimum of two days advance notice) by HUD Field Office staff or by a HUD representative, so that the property may be inspected and any necessary repairs accomplished, or by a sales broker.</P>

                  <P>(2) The occupant agrees to execute a month-to-month lease, at the time of acquisition of the property by the Secretary and on a form prescribed by HUD, to pay fair market rent as determined by the Secretary, and to pay the rent for the first month in advance at the time the lease is executed. The rental rate shall be established on the basis of rents charged for other properties in comparable condition after completion of repairs (if any).</P>
                  <P>(3) The occupant will have been in occupancy at least 90 days before the date the mortgagee acquires title to the property.</P>
                  <P>(4) The occupant's total housing cost (rent plus utility costs to be paid by the occupant) will not exceed 38 percent of the occupant's net effective income (gross income less Federal income taxes).

Only material in HUD's possession that directly pertains to conditions for continued occupancy under §§ 203.670, 203.673, and 203.674 may be considered material relevant for an occupant's review under this paragraph.

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Commissioner</E> means the Federal Housing Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Contract of insurance</E> means the agreement evidenced by the issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate or by the endorsement of the Commissioner upon the credit instrument given in connection with an insured mortgage, incorporating by reference the regulations in subpart C of this part and the applicable provisions of the National Housing Act.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Day</E> means calendar day, except where the term <E T="03">business day</E> is used.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Deferral Period</E> means the period of time following the death of the last surviving borrower during which the due and payable status of a HECM is deferred for an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse provided that the Qualifying Attributes and all other FHA requirements continue to be satisfied.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse</E> means a Non-Borrowing Spouse who meets all Qualifying Attributes for a Deferral Period.</P>

                <P>(1) Contingent on the prospective borrower obtaining a mortgage loan under this part, except the origination fee authorized by § 206.31 or a fee specifically authorized by the Commissioner; or</P>

                <P>
                  <E T="03">Expected average mortgage interest rate</E> means the interest rate used to calculate the principal limit established at closing. For fixed interest rate HECMs, the expected average mortgage interest rate is the same as the fixed mortgage (Note) interest rate and is set simultaneously with the fixed interest rate. For adjustable interest rate HECMs, it is either the sum of the mortgagee's margin plus the weekly average yield for U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of 10 years, or it is the sum of the mortgagee's margin plus the 10-year LIBOR swap rate, depending on which interest rate index is chosen by the borrower. The margin is determined by the mortgagee and is defined as the amount that is added to the index value to compute the expected average mortgage interest rate. The index type (CMT or LIBOR) used to calculate the expected average mortgage interest rate must be the same index type used <PRTPAGE P="251"/>to calculate mortgage interest rate adjustments—commingling of index types is not allowed. The mortgagee's margin is the same margin used to determine the initial interest rate and the periodic adjustments to the interest rate. Mortgagees, with the agreement of the borrower, may simultaneously lock in the expected average mortgage interest rate and the mortgagee's margin prior to the date of loan closing or simultaneously establish the expected average mortgage interest rate and the mortgagee's margin on the date of loan closing.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">First 12-Month Disbursement Period</E> means the period beginning on the day of loan closing and ending on the day before the loan closing anniversary date. When the day before the anniversary date of loan closing falls on a Federally-observed holiday, Saturday, or Sunday, the end period will be on the next business day after the Federally-observed holiday, Saturday or Sunday.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">HECM</E> means a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage.</P>

Index changes in excess of two percentage points may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment for a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.</P>
                  <P>(B) At each adjustment date for annual adjustable interest rate HECMs, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, except that the mortgage may provide for minimum interest rate change limitations and for minimum increments of interest rate changes.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Additional interest based on net appreciated value.</E> Any mortgage for which the mortgagee has chosen the shared premium option (§ 206.107) may provide for shared appreciation. At the time the mortgage becomes due and payable or is paid in full, whichever occurs first, the borrower shall pay an additional amount of interest equal to <PRTPAGE P="257"/>a percentage of any net appreciated value of the property during the life of the mortgage. The percentage of net appreciated value to be paid to the mortgagee, referred to as the appreciation margin, shall be no more than twenty-five percent, subject to an effective interest rate cap of no more than twenty percent.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of mortgagee share.</E> The mortgagee's share of net appreciated value is computed as follows:</P>

                  <P>(1) If the outstanding loan balance at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable is less than the appraised value of the property at the time of loan origination, the mortgagee's share is calculated by subtracting the appraised value at the time of loan origination from the adjusted sales proceeds (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> sales proceeds less transfer costs and capital improvement costs incurred by the borrower, but excluding any liens) and multiplying by the appreciation margin.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the outstanding loan balance is greater than the appraised value at the time of loan origination but less than the adjusted proceeds, the mortgagee's share is calculated by subtracting the outstanding loan balance from the adjusted sales proceeds and multiplying by the appreciation margin.</P>
                  <P>(3) If the outstanding loan balance is greater than the adjusted sales proceeds, the net appreciated value is zero.</P>

                  <P>(4) If there has been no sale or transfer involving satisfaction of the mortgage at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable, <E T="03">sales proceeds</E> for purposes of this section shall be the appraised value as determined in accordance with procedures approved by the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Effective interest rate.</E> To determine the effective interest rate, the amount of interest which accrued in the twelve months prior to the sale of the property or the prepayment is added to the mortgagee's share of the net appreciated value. The sum of the mortgagee's share of the net appreciated value and the interest, when divided by the sum of the outstanding loan balance at the beginning of the twelve-month period prior to sale or prepayment plus the payments to or on behalf of the borrower (but not including interest) in the twelve months prior to the sale or prepayment, shall not exceed an effective interest rate of twenty percent.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Disclosure.</E> At the time the mortgagee provides the borrower with a loan application for a mortgage with shared appreciation, the mortgagee shall disclose to the borrower the principal limit, payments and interest rate which are applicable to a comparable mortgage offered by the mortgagee without shared appreciation.</P>

                  <P>(2) The mortgagee shall make all monthly disbursements through the payment term even if the outstanding loan balance exceeds the principal <PRTPAGE P="260"/>limit because the actual average mortgage interest rate exceeds the expected average mortgage interest rate unless the HECM becomes due and payable under § 206.27(c).

                  <P>(2) Mortgagees shall ensure that tenure monthly disbursements made to the borrower during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period do not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If the sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit for that time period, the mortgagee shall decrease the monthly disbursements during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period to conform with the maximum Initial Disbursement Limit; upon conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request a payment plan recalculation.</P>
                  <P>(3) If the borrower makes a partial prepayment of the outstanding loan balance during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the mortgagee shall apply the funds from the partial prepayment in accordance with the Note.</P>
                  <P>(4) If the mortgagee receives repayment from insurance or condemnation proceeds after restoration or repair of the damaged property, the available principal limit and outstanding loan balance shall be reduced by the amount of such payments.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Line of credit separately or with monthly disbursements.</E> If the borrower has a line of credit, separately or combined with the term or tenure payment option, the principal limit is divided into an amount set aside for servicing charges under § 206.19(f)(3), an amount equal to the line of credit (including any portion of the principal limit set aside for repairs or property charges under § 206.19(f)(1) or (2)), and the remaining amount of the principal limit (if any). The line of credit amount increases at the same rate as the total principal limit increases under § 206.3. The sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period shall not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If a requested disbursement would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit, the mortgagee may make a partial disbursement to the borrower for the amount that will <PRTPAGE P="261"/>not exceed the limit. Upon the conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request subsequent disbursements up to the available principal limit.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Single Lump Sum payment option.</E> (1) Under the Single Lump Sum payment option, the Borrower's Advance shall be made by the mortgagee to the borrower in an amount that does not exceed the maximum allowable Borrower's Advance under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the borrower makes a partial prepayment of the outstanding loan balance any time after loan closing and before the contract of insurance is terminated, the mortgagee shall apply the funds from the partial prepayment in accordance with the Note.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Payment of MIP and interest.</E> At the end of each month, including the first month, interest accrued during that month shall be added to the outstanding loan balance. Where the first month is a partial month, a prorated amount of interest shall be added. Monthly MIP, which will accrue from the closing date, shall be added to the outstanding loan balance beginning with the first day of the second month after closing when paid to the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Mortgagee late charge.</E> The mortgagee shall pay a late charge to the borrower for any late disbursement. If the mortgagee does not mail or electronically transfer a scheduled monthly disbursement to the borrower on the first business day of the month or make a line of credit disbursement within 5 business days of the date the mortgagee received the request, the late charge shall be 10 percent of the entire amount that should have been paid to the borrower for that month or as a result of that request. In no event shall the total late charge exceed five hundred dollars. For each additional day that the borrower does not receive payment, the mortgagee shall pay interest at the mortgage interest rate on the late payment. Any late charge and interest shall be paid from the mortgagee's funds and shall not be added to the outstanding loan balance.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">No minimum payments.</E> A mortgagee shall not require, as a condition of providing a loan secured by a mortgage insured under this part, that the monthly payments under the term or tenure payment option or draws under the line of credit payment option exceed a minimum amount established by the mortgagee.</P>

The mortgagee shall obtain a title insurance policy satisfactory to the Commissioner. If the Commissioner determines that title insurance for reverse mortgages is not available for reasonable rates in a state, then the Commissioner may specify other acceptable forms of title evidence in lieu of title insurance.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Are otherwise determined by the Commissioner to be subject to a flood hazard.</P>
                  <P>(2) No mortgage may be insured that covers property improvements located in an area that has been identified by FEMA as an area having special flood hazards, unless the community in which the area is situated is participating in the NFIP and such insurance is obtained by the borrower. Such requirement for flood insurance shall be effective one year after the date of notification by FEMA to the chief executive officer of a flood prone community that such community has been identified as having special flood hazards.</P>
                  <P>(3) The flood insurance must be maintained during such time as the mortgage is insured in an amount at least equal to the lowest of the following:</P>
                  <P>(i) 100 percent replacement cost of the insurable value of the improvements, which consists of the development or project cost less estimated land cost; or</P>

                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Restrictions on conveyance.</E> The property must be freely marketable. Conveyance of the property may only be restricted as permitted under 24 CFR 203.41 or 24 CFR 234.66 and this part, except that a right of first refusal to purchase a unit in a condominium project is permitted if the right is held by the condominium association for the project.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Need for repairs.</E> Properties must meet the applicable property requirements of the Commissioner in order to be eligible. Properties that do not meet the property requirements must be repaired in order to ensure that the repaired property will serve as adequate security for the insured mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Assurance that repairs are made.</E> The mortgage may be closed before the repair work is completed if the Commissioner estimates that the cost of the remaining repair work will not exceed 15 percent of the maximum claim amount and the mortgage contains provisions approved by the Commissioner concerning payment for the repairs.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Reimbursement to contractor.</E> When repair work is completed after closing by a contractor, the mortgagee shall cause one or more inspections of the property to be made by an inspector or other qualified individual acceptable to the Commissioner in order to ensure that the repair work is satisfactory, and prior to the release of funds from the Repair Set Aside. The mortgagee shall hold back a portion of the contract price attributable to the work done before each interim release of funds, and the total of the hold backs will be released after the final inspection and approval of the release by the mortgagee. The mortgagee shall ensure that all mechanics' and materialmen's liens are released of record.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Reimbursement to borrower.</E> The mortgagee shall not reimburse the borrower for any labor the borrower performed. The mortgagee may reimburse the borrower for the actual cost of repair materials from the Repair Set Aside, provided that the mortgagee causes one or more inspections of the property by an inspector or other qualified individual acceptable to the Commissioner and meets all reimbursement requirements established by the Commissioner.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Sale by owner of record</E>—(1) <E T="03">Owner of record requirement.</E> To be eligible for a mortgage insured by FHA, the property must be purchased from the owner of record and the transaction may not involve any sale or assignment of the sales contract.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Supporting documentation.</E> The mortgagee shall obtain documentation verifying that the seller is the owner of record and must submit this documentation to FHA as part of the application for mortgage insurance, in accordance with §§ 206.15 and 206.115(b)(9).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Time restrictions on re-sales</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The eligibility of a property for a mortgage insured by FHA is dependent on the time that has elapsed between the date the seller acquired the property (based upon the date of settlement) and the date of execution of the sales contract that will result in the FHA mortgage insurance (the re-sale date). The mortgagee shall obtain documentation verifying compliance with the time restrictions described in this paragraph and must submit this documentation to FHA as part of the <PRTPAGE P="270"/>application for mortgage insurance, in accordance with § 206.115(b).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Re-sales occurring 90 days or less following acquisition.</E> If the re-sale date is 90 days or less following the date of acquisition by the seller, the property is not eligible for a mortgage to be insured by FHA.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Re-sales occurring between 91 days and 180 days following acquisition.</E> (i) If the re-sale date is between 91 days and 180 days following acquisition by the seller, the property is generally eligible for a mortgage insured by FHA.</P>
                  <P>(ii) However, FHA will require that the mortgagee obtain additional documentation if the re-sale price is 100 percent over the purchase price. Such documentation must include an appraisal from another appraiser. The mortgagee may also document its loan file to support the increased value by establishing that the increased value results from the rehabilitation of the property.</P>

                  <P>(iii) FHA may revise the level at which additional documentation is required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section at 50 to 150 percent over the original purchase price. FHA will revise this level by <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice with a 30 day delayed effective date.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Authority to address property flipping for re-sales occurring between 91 days and 12 months following acquisition.</E> (i) If the re-sale date is more than 90 days after the date of acquisition by the seller, but before the end of the twelfth month after the date of acquisition, the property is eligible for a mortgage to be insured by FHA.</P>
                  <P>(ii) However, FHA may require that the mortgagee provide additional documentation to support the re-sale value of the property if the re-sale price is 5 percent or greater than the lowest sales price of the property during the preceding 12 months (as evidenced by the contract of sale). At FHA's discretion, such documentation must include, but is not limited to, an appraisal from another appraiser. FHA may exclude re-sales of less than a specific dollar amount from the additional value documentation requirements.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If the additional value documentation supports a value of the property that is more than 5 percent lower than the value supported by the first appraisal, the lower value will be used to calculate the maximum claim amount. Otherwise, the value supported by the first appraisal will be used to calculate the maximum claim amount.</P>

                  <P>(iv) FHA will announce its determination to require additional value documentation through issuance of a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. The requirement for additional value documentation may be established either on a nationwide or regional basis. Further, the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice will specify the percentage increase in the re-sale price that will trigger the need for additional documentation, and will specify the acceptable types of documentation. The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice may also exclude re-sales of less than a specific dollar amount from the additional value documentation requirements. Any such <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, and any subsequent revisions, will be issued at least thirty days before taking effect.</P>
                  <P>(v) The level at which additional documentation is required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall supersede that under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions to the time restrictions on sales.</E> The time restrictions on sales described in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to:</P>
                  <P>(1) Sales by HUD of Real Estate-Owned (REO) properties under 24 CFR part 291 and of single family assets in revitalization areas pursuant to section 204 of the NHA (12 U.S.C. 1710);</P>
                  <P>(2) Sales by another agency of the United States Government of REO single family properties pursuant to programs operated by these agencies;</P>
                  <P>(3) Sales of properties by nonprofit organizations approved to purchase HUD REO single family properties at a discount with resale restrictions;</P>
                  <P>(4) Sales of properties that were acquired by the sellers by inheritance;</P>

                  <P>(8) Only upon announcement by FHA through issuance of a notice, sales of properties located in areas designated by the President as federal disaster areas. The notice will specify how long the exception will be in effect.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Sanctions and indemnification.</E> Failure of a mortgagee to comply with the requirements of this section may result in HUD requesting indemnification of the mortgage loan, or seeking other appropriate remedies under 24 CFR part 25.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, all requirements applicable to the insurance of HECMs under this part apply to the insurance of refinanced HECMs. FHA may, upon application by a mortgagee, insure any mortgage given to refinance an existing HECM insured under this part, including loans assigned to the Commissioner as described in § 206.107(a)(1) and § 206.121(b).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of “total cost of the refinancing”.</E> For purposes of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the term “total cost of the refinancing” means the sum of the allowable charges and fees permitted under § 206.31 and the initial MIP described in § 206.105(a) and paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial MIP limit.</E> (1) The initial MIP paid by the mortgagee pursuant to § 206.105(a) shall not exceed the difference between: three percent of the increase in the maximum claim amount for the new HECM, minus the amount of the initial MIP already charged and paid by the borrower for the existing HECM that is being refinanced. No refunds will be given if the initial MIP paid on the existing HECM exceeds the initial MIP due on the new HECM.</P>
                  <P>(2) The HECM refinance authority is only applicable when the property that serves as collateral for the FHA-insured mortgage remains the same.</P>
                  <P>(3) Existing HECM borrowers refinancing an existing HECM are eligible for a MIP reduction under the conditions of this section, but existing HECM borrowers who participate in a HECM for Purchase transaction are ineligible for a reduction in the initial MIP.</P>

                  <P>(i) The total cost of the refinancing to the borrower; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) The increase in the borrower's principal limit as measured by the estimated initial principal limit on the mortgage to be insured less the current principal limit on the HECM that is being refinanced under this section.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing of anti-churning disclosure.</E> The mortgagee shall provide the anti-churning disclosure concurrently with the disclosures required under § 206.43.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver of counseling requirement.</E> The borrower and any Non-Borrowing Spouse may elect not to receive counseling under § 206.41, but only if:</P>
                  <P>(1) The original HECM was assigned a Case Number on or after August 4, 2014, and the borrower and Non-Borrowing Spouse, if applicable, received counseling required under § 206.41; or where the original HECM was assigned a Case Number prior to August 4, 2014, and there is no applicable Non-Borrowing Spouse.</P>
                  <P>(2) The borrower has received the anti-churning disclosure required under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(3) The increase in the borrower's principal limit (as provided in the anti-churning disclosure) exceeds the total cost of the refinancing by an amount established by the Commissioner through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. FHA may periodically update this amount through publication of a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Publication of any such revised amount will occur at least 30 days before the revision becomes effective.<PRTPAGE P="272"/>

A Non-Borrowing Spouse that is ineligible for the Deferral Period at the time of loan origination because he or she failed to satisfy the Qualifying Attributes requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not subsequently eligible for a Deferral Period when the borrowing spouse dies or moves out of the home.</P>

                  <P>(2) The Commissioner is authorized to determine if there is any information indicating that any certification or required document is false, misleading, or constitutes fraud or misrepresentation on the part of any party, or that the mortgage fails to meet a statutory or regulatory requirement. If, following this review, the mortgage is determined to be eligible, the Commissioner will endorse the mortgage for insurance by issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate. If the mortgage is determined to be ineligible, the Commissioner will inform the mortgagee in writing of this determination, and include the reasons for the determination and any corrective actions that may be taken.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission by mortgagee other than originating mortgagee.</E> If the originating mortgagee assigns the mortgage to another approved mortgagee before pre-endorsement review under paragraph (c) of this section, the assignee may submit the required documents for pre-endorsement review in the name of the originating mortgagee. All certifications must be executed by the originating mortgagee (or its underwriter, if appropriate). The purchasing mortgagee may pay any required mortgage insurance premium, late charge and interest.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Post-Endorsement review for Direct Endorsement.</E> Following endorsement for insurance, the Commissioner may review all documents required by paragraph (b) of this section. If, following this review, the Commissioner determines that the mortgage does not satisfy the requirements of the Direct Endorsement program, the Commissioner may place the mortgagee on Direct Endorsement probation, or terminate the authority of the mortgagee to participate in the Direct Endorsement program pursuant to § 206.15, or refer the matter to the Mortgagee Review Board for action pursuant to part 25 of this title.<PRTPAGE P="279"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Creation of the contract.</E> The mortgage shall be an insured mortgage from the date of the issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate, from the date of the endorsement of the credit instrument, or from the date of FHA's electronic acknowledgement to the mortgagee that the mortgage is insured, as applicable. The Commissioner and the mortgagee are thereafter bound by the regulations in this subpart with the same force and to the same extent as if a separate contract had been executed relating to the insured mortgage, including the provisions of the regulations in this subpart and of the National Housing Act.</P>

                  <P>The Commissioner is required by statute to take any action necessary to provide a borrower with funds to which the borrower is entitled under the mortgage and which the borrower does not receive because of the default of the mortgagee. The Commissioner may hold a second mortgage to secure repayment by the borrower under § 206.27(d). Where the Commissioner does not hold a second mortgage, but makes a payment to the borrower, and such payment is not reimbursed by the mortgagee, the Commissioner shall accept assignment of the first mortgage.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Investigation.</E> The Commissioner will investigate all complaints by a borrower concerning late payments. If the Commissioner determines that the mortgagee is unable or unwilling to make all payments required under the mortgage, including late charges, the Commissioner shall pay such payments and late charges to the borrower.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Reimbursement or assignment.</E> The Commissioner may demand that within 30 days from the demand, the mortgagee reimburse the Commissioner, with interest from the date of payment by the Commissioner, or assign the insured mortgage to the Commissioner. Interest shall be paid at a rate set in conformity with the Treasury Financial Manual. If the mortgagee complies with the reimbursement demand, then the contract of insurance shall not be affected. If the mortgagee complies by assigning the mortgage for record within 30 days of the demand, then the Commissioner shall pay an insurance claim as provided in § 206.129(e)(3) and assume all responsibilities of the mortgagee under the first mortgage. If the mortgagee fails to comply with the demand within 30 days, the contract of insurance will terminate as provided in § 206.133(c).</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Second mortgage.</E> If the contract of insurance is terminated as provided in § 206.133(c), all payments to the borrower by the Commissioner will be secured by the second mortgage, unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner. Payments will be due and payable in the same manner as under the insured first mortgage. The liability of the borrower under the first mortgage shall be limited to payments actually made by the mortgagee to or on behalf of the borrower (including prior recoupment of the MIP remitted by the mortgagee and billed to the borrower), and shall exclude accrued interest, whether or not it has been included in the outstanding loan balance, and shared appreciation, if any. Interest will stop accruing on the first mortgage when the Commissioner begins to make payments under the second mortgage. The first mortgage will not be due and payable until the second mortgage is due and payable.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial action by the mortgagee.</E> (1) The mortgagee shall notify the Commissioner within 60 days of the mortgage becoming due and payable when the conditions stated in the mortgage, as required by § 206.27(c)(1) have occurred or when the Deferral Period ends.

                  <P>(vi) Such other actions as permitted by the Commissioner through notice.</P>
                  <P>(3) For a borrower, even after a foreclosure proceeding is begun, the mortgagee shall permit the borrower to correct the condition which resulted in the mortgage coming due and payable and to reinstate the mortgage, and the mortgage insurance shall continue in effect. The mortgagee may require the borrower to pay any costs that the mortgagee incurred to reinstate the borrower, including foreclosure costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Such costs shall be paid by adding them to the outstanding loan balance. The mortgagee may refuse reinstatement by the borrower if:</P>
                  <P>(i) The mortgagee has accepted reinstatement of the mortgage within the past two years immediately preceding the current notification to the borrower that the mortgage is due and payable;</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Appraisal.</E> The mortgagee shall have the property appraised by an appraiser on the FHA roster, or other appraiser acceptable to, and identified by, the Commissioner through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, no later than 30 days after receipt of the request by an applicable party in connection with a potential property sale. The property shall be appraised before a foreclosure sale and have an effective appraisal date that is no more than 30 days before such sale. The appraisal shall be at the requesting party's expense unless the mortgage is due and payable. If the mortgage is due and payable, the appraisal shall be at the mortgagee's expense but the mortgagee shall have a right to be reimbursed out of the proceeds of any sale by the borrower or other permissible party. The Commissioner may, through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, identify other acceptable types of valuation for establishing the value of HECMs for the purpose of sale.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Sale by borrower or other permissible party.</E> Where the HECM is not due and payable, the borrower or an authorized representative of the borrower may sell the property for at least the lesser of the outstanding loan balance or the appraised value. Where the HECM is due and payable at the time the contract for sale is executed, the borrower or other party with legal right to dispose of the property may sell the property in accordance with the amount established by § 206.125(a)(2)(ii).

                  <P>(2) If the laws of the State, city, or municipality or other political subdivision in which the mortgaged property is located or if Federal bankruptcy law does not permit the commencement of the foreclosure in accordance with § 206.125(d)(1), the mortgagee shall commence foreclosure within six months after the expiration of the time during which such foreclosure is prohibited by such laws.</P>
                  <P>(3) The mortgagee shall give written notice to the Commissioner within 30 days after the initiation of foreclosure proceedings, and shall exercise reasonable diligence in prosecuting the foreclosure proceedings to completion and in acquiring title to and possession of the property. A time frame that is determined by the Commissioner to constitute “reasonable diligence” for each State is made available to mortgagees.</P>
                  <P>(4) The mortgagee shall bid at the foreclosure sale an amount at least equal to the lesser of the sum of the outstanding loan balance and any and all other incurred expenses, or the current appraised value of the property. Such a bid by any party other than the mortgagee, for the full loan balance and all associated expenses, will result in a full payoff of the loan and no claim for insurance benefits being presented to FHA.</P>

                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cash for Keys.</E> The Commissioner may provide a financial incentive, in an amount to be determined by the Commissioner, to be paid by the mortgagee and reimbursed through any subsequent claim where a borrower or other party with a legal right to do so deeds the property within 6 months of the due date.</P>

                  <P>(2) In exchange for the executed and delivered deed, the mortgagee shall <PRTPAGE P="282"/>cancel the credit instrument and deliver it to the borrower and satisfy the mortgage of record. If applicable, the mortgagee shall request that the Commissioner cancel the credit instrument and deliver it to the borrower and satisfy the mortgage of record.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Sale of the acquired property.</E> (1) Upon acquisition of the property by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, the mortgagee shall take possession of, preserve, and repair the property and shall make diligent efforts to sell the property within six months from the date the mortgagee acquired the property, or such additional time as provided by the Commissioner. The mortgagee shall sell the property for an amount not less than the appraised value (as provided under paragraph (b) of this section) unless the mortgagee does not file an application for insurance benefits or written permission is obtained from the Commissioner authorizing a sale at a lower price.</P>
                  <P>(2) Repairs shall not exceed those required by local law, or the requirements of the Commissioner or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs if the sale of the property is financed with a mortgage insured by the Commissioner or guaranteed, insured, or taken by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. No other repairs shall be made without the specific advance approval of the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(3) The mortgagee shall not enter into a contract for the preservation, repair, or sale of the property with any officer, employee, or owner of ten percent or more interest in the mortgagee or with any other person or organization having an identity of interest with the mortgagee or with any relative of such officer, employee, owner, or person.</P>
                  <P>(4) The Commissioner may provide financial incentive, in an amount to be determined by the Commissioner, to be paid by the mortgagee and reimbursed through a subsequent claim when a bona fide tenant vacates the property prior to an eviction being initiated by the mortgagee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Mortgage servicing generally; sanctions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This subpart identifies servicing practices that the Commissioner considers acceptable mortgage servicing practices of lending institutions servicing mortgages insured by the Commissioner. Failure to comply with this subpart shall not be a basis for denial of the insurance benefits, but a pattern of refusal or failure to comply will be cause for withdrawal of FHA mortgagee approval.<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Importance of timely payments.</E> The paramount servicing responsibility is to make timely payments in full as required by the mortgage. Any failure of a mortgagee to make all payments required by the mortgage in a timely manner will be grounds for administrative sanctions authorized by regulations, including 2 CFR part 2424 (Debarment, Suspension, and Limited Denial of Participation), and 24 CFR part 25 (Mortgagee Review Board).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibility for servicing.</E> (1) Servicing of insured mortgages must be performed by a mortgagee that is approved by FHA to service insured mortgages. The servicer must fully discharge the servicing responsibilities of the mortgagee as outlined in this part. The mortgagee shall remain fully responsible to the Commissioner for proper servicing, and the actions of its servicer shall be considered to be the actions of the mortgagee. The servicer also shall be fully responsible to the Commissioner for its actions as a servicer.</P>
                <P>(2) Whenever servicing of any mortgage is transferred from one mortgagee or servicer to another, notice of the transfer of service shall be delivered:</P>
                <P>(i) By the transferor mortgagee or servicer to the borrower. The notification shall be delivered not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer and shall contain the information required in 12 CFR 1024.33(b)(4); and</P>
                <P>(ii) By the transferee mortgagee or servicer:</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">To the borrower.</E> The notification shall be delivered not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer and shall contain the information required in 12 CFR 1024.33(b)(4); and</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">To the Commissioner.</E> This notification shall be delivered within 15 days of the transfer, in a format prescribed by the Commissioner.</P>

                </SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Statements of account activity.</E> The mortgagee shall provide to the borrower a monthly statement regarding the activity of the mortgage for each month, as well as for the calendar year. The statement shall summarize the total principal amount which has been paid to the borrower under the mortgage during that calendar year, the MIP paid to the Commissioner and charged to the borrower, the total amount of deferred interest added to the outstanding loan balance, the total outstanding loan balance, and the current principal limit. The mortgagee shall include an accounting of all payments for property charges. The statement shall be provided to the borrower monthly until the mortgage is paid in full by the borrower. The mortgagee shall provide the borrower with a new payment plan every time it recalculates monthly payments or the payment option is changed. The statements shall be in a format acceptable to the Commissioner.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Servicing—Providing information.</E> (1) Mortgagees shall provide loan information to borrowers and arrange for individual loan consultation on request. The mortgagee must establish written procedures and controls to assure prompt responses to inquiries. One or more of the following means of making information readily available to borrowers is required:</P>
                <P>(i) A servicing office staffed with competent personnel located within 200 miles of the property, capable of providing timely responses to requests for information. Complete records need not be maintained in such an office if the staff is able to secure needed information and pass it on to the borrower.</P>
                <P>(ii) Toll-free telephone service at an office capable of providing needed information.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) All borrowers must be informed of and reminded annually of the system available for obtaining answers to loan inquiries and the office from which needed information may be obtained. Toll-free telephone service need not be provided to a borrower other than at the office designated to serve the borrower nor other than from the immediate vicinity of the security property.</P>

                <P>(ii) The mortgagee shall provide the borrower with the telephone number where the borrower may speak to employee(s) specifically designated by the mortgagee or its servicer to address inquiries concerning mortgages insured under this part. Such information shall be provided annually and whenever the <PRTPAGE P="293"/>servicer or the designated employee (or employee group) changes.</P>
                <P>(3) Mortgagees must respond to FHA requests for information concerning individual accounts.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Method of property charge payment</E>—(1) <E T="03">LESA required.</E> For fixed or adjustable interest rate HECMs, based on the results of the Financial Assessment, the mortgagee may require the borrower to have a Fully-Funded LESA for the payment of property charges identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For adjustable interest rate HECMs, based on the results of the Financial Assessment, the mortgagee may require the borrower to have a Partially-Funded LESA for the payment of property charges identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">LESA not required.</E> (i) If, based on the results of the Financial Assessment, the mortgagee does not require the borrower to have a LESA, the borrower shall elect one of the following at closing, whereby an election of the option in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) or (C) of this section cannot be cancelled by the borrower:</P>
                <P>(A) Borrower is responsible for the independent payment of all property charges;</P>
                <P>(B) Borrower elects to have a Fully-Funded LESA for the payment of property charges identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(C) For adjustable interest rate HECMs only, borrower elects to have the mortgagee pay property charges listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section which would have otherwise been required to be paid by the borrower, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) Through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, the Commissioner may establish an incentive for voluntarily electing a LESA under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Life Expectancy Set Aside</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) For a Fully-Funded LESA, the mortgagee shall:</P>

                <P>(B) Make early payments to take advantage of a discount whenever it is to the borrower's advantage;</P>
                <P>(C) Not charge the borrower penalties for late payments for property charges unless it can be shown that the penalty was the direct result of the borrower's error or omission;</P>

                <P>(E) Add payments for property charges to the outstanding loan balance when the mortgagee disburses funds to the taxing authority or insurance carrier; and</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Calculation of property charges.</E> (i) The projected cost of property charges that will be required over the life expectancy of the youngest borrower shall be calculated based on a formula established by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(ii) The mortgagee shall not require any LESA to be funded in excess of the projected cost of property charges.</P>
                <P>(iii) For a Fully-Funded LESA, the amount withheld from the mortgage proceeds shall equal the projected cost of property charges.</P>
                <P>(iv) For a Partially-Funded LESA, the amount withheld from the mortgage proceeds is based on a calculation of the gap in residual income and may not exceed the projected cost of property charges.</P>
                <P>(v) Mortgagees shall use the <E T="03">HECM Financial Assessment and Property Charge Guide,</E> or subsequent guide issued by the Commissioner, to determine whether a LESA is required; view the formula for calculating the projected costs of property charges; and view the formulas for calculating the Fully- and Partially-Funded LESA amounts.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Annual analysis of LESA.</E> Mortgagees shall perform an annual analysis of the LESA to determine whether the funds are sufficient to make required distributions for the next year. If funds are exhausted or there is an insufficient balance determination, the mortgagee shall notify the borrower, in writing and within 15 calendar days of the annual analysis of the determination, that LESA funds are exhausted or insufficient and the borrower will be responsible for the payment of property charges.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Non-payment of property charges</E>—(i) <E T="03">Fully-Funded LESA for an adjustable interest rate HECM with no remaining funds.</E> (A) If the LESA is exhausted and the borrower fails to make property charge payments, the mortgagee shall use any available principal limit to pay the outstanding property charge amount in full and charge the borrower's account.</P>
                <P>(B) The mortgagee shall provide the borrower with a written notification within 30 days of the mortgagee receiving notification that a property charge payment is outstanding. The borrower shall have 30 days to respond to the mortgagee to explain the circumstances which resulted in the non-payment. (C) If there is no available principal limit from which the mortgagee can pay the property charge amount in full, and the borrower fails to pay the property charges, the mortgage will become due and payable under § 206.27(c)(2).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Fully-Funded LESA for a fixed interest rate HECM with no remaining funds.</E> If the LESA is exhausted and the borrower fails to make property charge payments, the mortgage will become due and payable under § 206.27(c)(2).—</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Partially-Funded LESA with remaining funds.</E> If funds remain in the LESA and the borrower fails to make property charge payments, the mortgagee shall:</P>
                <P>(A) Immediately suspend future semi-annual payments to the borrower from the Partially-Funded LESA, although scheduled and unscheduled payments from the borrower's payment option may continue;</P>
                <P>(B) Disburse funds from the Partially-Funded LESA to pay the full amount owed for the past due property charge; and</P>
                <P>(C) Provide written notification to the borrower, within 30 days of the mortgagee receiving notification that a property charge payment is outstanding, that funds were advanced from the Partially-Funded LESA to pay the outstanding property charge. The borrower shall have 30 days to respond to the mortgagee to explain the circumstances which resulted in the non-payment.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Partially-Funded LESA with no remaining funds.</E> (A) If the LESA is exhausted and the borrower fails to make property charge payments when due, the mortgagee shall use any funds available in the principal limit to pay the outstanding property charge amount in full and charge the borrower's account.</P>

                <P>(B) The mortgagee shall provide written notification to the borrower within <PRTPAGE P="295"/>30 days of the mortgagee receiving notification that a property charge payment is outstanding. The borrower shall have 30 days to respond to the mortgagee to explain the circumstances which resulted in the non-payment.</P>
                <P>(C) If there is no available principal limit from which the mortgagee can pay the property charge amount in full, and the borrower fails to pay the property charges, the mortgage will become due and payable under § 206.27(c)(2).</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Unused LESA funds.</E> During a Deferral Period or when one of the events listed in § 206.27(c)(1) or (c)(2) have occurred, no unused funds from the LESA shall be disbursed.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Assignment of mortgage to the Commissioner.</E> If the insured first mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner, or if payments are made through the second mortgage under the Demand Assignment process, the Commissioner is not required to assume the responsibility for property charge payments, but may continue to administer payments for property charges for a borrower with a Fully-Funded LESA or semi-annual disbursements to a borrower with a Partially-Funded LESA to the extent that there are any funds available in the LESA. For adjustable interest rate HECMs, if the LESA has a positive remaining balance but funds are insufficient to pay all property charges due or semi-annual disbursements to the borrower, the Commissioner may provide the remaining funds to the borrower as a line of credit.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Borrower elects to have mortgagee pay property charges.</E> If, based on the results of the Financial Assessment, the mortgagee does not require the borrower to have a LESA, for adjustable interest rate HECMs, the borrower may elect at closing to require the mortgagee to pay property charges identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by withholding funds from monthly payments due to the borrower or by charging such funds to a line of credit. This voluntary election to have funds withheld by the mortgagee to pay property charges cannot be canceled by the borrower at any time. If the sum of the outstanding loan balance and any unused set aside for repairs and servicing charges has reached the principal limit or the HECM proceeds are otherwise insufficient to pay the property charges, the borrower shall pay such property charges, even though the borrower elected payment to be made by the mortgagee. Through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, the Commissioner may expand the borrower's options for property charge payment by the mortgagee.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Assignment of mortgage to the Commissioner.</E> If the insured first mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner under § 206.107(a)(1) or § 206.121(b), or if payments are made through the second mortgage under § 206.121(c), the Commissioner is not required to assume the mortgagee's responsibility under paragraph (d) of this section, despite the election by the borrower.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Mortgagee's responsibilities.</E> (i) Funds withheld from payments due to the borrower for property charges under paragraph (d) of this section shall not be paid into an escrow account. When property charges are actually paid, the mortgagee may add the amount paid to the outstanding loan balance.</P>
                <P>(ii) It is the mortgagee's responsibility to make disbursements for property charges before bills become delinquent. Mortgagees shall establish controls to ensure that the information needed to pay such bills is obtained on a timely basis. Penalties for late payments for property charges must not be charged to the borrower unless it can be shown that the penalty was the direct result of the borrower's error or omission. Early payment of a bill to take advantage of a discount should be made whenever it is to the borrower's benefit.</P>

                <P>(iii) Not later than the end of the second loan year the mortgagee shall establish a system for the periodic analysis of the amounts withheld from monthly payments. The analysis shall be performed at least once a year thereafter. The amount shall be adjusted, after analysis, to provide sufficient available funds to make anticipated disbursements during the ensuing year. The borrower shall be given at least ten days' notice of adjustment in the amount of withholding and an adequate explanation of the reasons for any change. When the amount withheld <PRTPAGE P="296"/>is analyzed in accordance with this paragraph, any surplus shall be paid to the borrower and added to the outstanding loan balance. Any shortage shall be corrected through increasing the monthly withholding as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. If amounts withheld are insufficient to pay a property charge before it is delinquent, and the borrower could request a payment equal to the shortage under § 206.26(b), then the mortgagee shall pay the full property charge and treat payment of the shortage as a payment requested by the borrower under § 206.26(b).</P>
                <P>(iv) The mortgagee's estimate of withholding amount shall be based on the best information available as to probable payments which will be required to be made for property charges in the coming year. If actual disbursements during the preceding year are used as the basis, the resulting estimate may deviate from those disbursements by as much as ten percent. The mortgagee may not require withholding in excess of the current estimated total annual requirement, unless expressly requested by the borrower. Each monthly withholding for property charges shall equal one-twelfth of the annual amounts as reasonably estimated by the mortgagee.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Borrower elects to pay property charges.</E> (1) If, based on the results of the Financial Assessment, the mortgagee does not require the borrower to have a LESA, the borrower may elect to be responsible for the independent payment of all property charges and shall pay all property charges in a timely manner and shall provide evidence of payment to the mortgagee as required in the mortgage.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to pay property charges.</E> If the borrower fails to pay the property charges in a timely manner, and has not elected to have the mortgagee make the payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) The mortgagee may make the payment for the borrower and charge the borrower's account if there are available funds from which the mortgagee may make payment. If a pattern of missed payments occurs, the mortgagee may establish procedures to pay the property charges from the borrower's funds as if the borrower elected to have the mortgagee pay the property charges under this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) The mortgagee shall provide a written notification to the borrower and notify the Commissioner that an obligation of the mortgage has not been performed within 30 days of the mortgagee receiving notification of a missed payment when there are no available HECM funds from which the mortgagee may make payment. The borrower shall have 30 days to respond to the mortgagee to explain the circumstances which resulted in the non-payment. The mortgagee may provide any permissible loss mitigation made available by the Commissioner through notice. If the borrower is unable or unwilling to repay the mortgagee for any funds advanced by the mortgagee to pay property charges outside of a LESA, the mortgagee shall submit a due and payable request under the provisions of § 206.27(c)(2).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Establishment of the HECM Counselor Roster.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">HECM Counselor Roster.</E> FHA maintains a Roster of HECM counselors. Only counselors listed on the Roster and employed by a participating agency are approved to provide HECM counseling. A prospective borrower applying for a HECM loan to be insured by FHA must receive the required HECM counseling from one of the counselors on the Roster.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclaimer.</E> The inclusion of a HECM counselor on the Roster does not create or imply a warranty or endorsement by FHA of the listed counselor to a prospective HECM borrower or to any other organization or individual, nor does it represent a warranty of any counseling provided by the listed HECM counselor. The inclusion of a counselor on the Roster means that a listed counselor has met the FHA-prescribed qualifications and conditions for inclusion on the Roster and that the counselor is approved to provide HECM counseling by telephone or face-to-face.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Eligibility for placement on the HECM Counselor Roster.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> To be considered for placement on the Roster, a housing counselor must apply to FHA in a form and in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> FHA will approve an application for placement on the Roster if the application demonstrates that the housing counselor:</P>
                <P>(1) Is employed by a HUD-approved housing counseling agency or an affiliate of a HUD-approved intermediary or State housing finance agency;</P>
                <P>(2) Successfully passed a standardized HECM counseling exam administered by FHA, or a party selected by FHA, within the last 3 years. In order to maintain eligibility, a HECM counselor must successfully pass a standardized HECM counseling exam every 3 years;</P>
                <P>(3) Received training and education related to HECMs within the prior 2 years;</P>

                <P>(4) Has access to and is supported by technology that enables FHA to track <PRTPAGE P="299"/>the results of the counseling offered to each loan applicant, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> what action(s), if any, did the client take after receiving the HECM counseling; and</P>
                <P>(5) Is not listed on:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Removal from the HECM Counselor Roster.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> FHA reserves the right to remove a HECM counselor from the Roster, in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cause for removal.</E> Cause for removal of a HECM counselor from the Roster includes, but is not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Failure to comply with the education and training requirements of § 206.308;</P>
                <P>(2) Failure to respond within a reasonable time to HUD inquiries or requests for documentation;</P>
                <P>(3) Misrepresentation or fraudulent statements;</P>
                <P>(4) Promotion, representation, or recommendation of any specific mortgagee;</P>
                <P>(5) Failure to comply with applicable fair housing and civil rights requirements;</P>
                <P>(6) Failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations;</P>
                <P>(7) Failure to comply with applicable statutory counseling requirements found at section 255(f) of the National Housing Act, which include, but are not limited to, providing information about: options other than a HECM, the financial implications of entering into a HECM, the tax consequences of a HECM, and any other information that HUD or the applicant may request;</P>
                <P>(8) Failure to maintain any registration, license, or certification requirements of a State or local authority;</P>
                <P>(9) Unsatisfactory performance in providing counseling to HECM loan applicants. FHA may determine that a HECM counselor's performance is unsatisfactory based on a review of counseling files or other monitoring activities, or if the counselor fails to employ the minimum competencies, as measured by the FHA-administered HECM counseling exam; or</P>
                <P>(10) For any other reason HUD determines to be so serious as to justify an administrative sanction.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Automatic removal from HECM Counselor Roster for failure to maintain required State or local licensure.</E> A HECM counselor who is required to maintain a State or local registration, license, or certification and whose registration or certification is revoked, suspended, or surrendered will be automatically suspended from the Roster until FHA receives evidence demonstrating that the local- or State-imposed sanction has been lifted.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Removal procedure.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following procedures apply to removal of a HECM counselor from the Roster.</P>
                <P>(1) FHA will give the HECM counselor written notice of the proposed removal. The notice will state the reasons for and the duration of the proposed removal.</P>
                <P>(2) The HECM counselor will have 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice (or such time as described in the notice, but in no event less than a period of 30 days) to submit a written appeal of the proposed removal, along with a written request for a conference.</P>
                <P>(3) An FHA official will review the appeal and render a response affirming, modifying, or canceling the removal. The FHA official will not be a person who was involved in FHA's initial removal decision. FHA will respond with a decision within 30 days after the date of receiving the appeal or, if the HECM counselor has requested a conference, within 30 days after the conference was held. FHA may extend the 30-day period by providing written notice to the counselor.</P>

                <P>(4) If the HECM counselor does not submit a timely written response, the removal will be effective 31 days after the date of FHA's initial removal notice (or after the period provided in the notice, if longer than 30 days). If a written response is submitted, and the removal decision is affirmed or modified, the removal will be effective on the date of FHA's notice affirming or modifying the initial removal decision.<PRTPAGE P="300"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Maximum time period of removal.</E> The maximum time period for removal from the Roster is 12 months from the effective date of removal for all removed counselors. A counselor who has been removed must apply for reinstatement on the Roster.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Placement on the Roster after removal.</E> A counselor who has been removed from the Roster must apply for reinstatement on the Roster (in accordance with § 206.304) after the period of the counselor's removal from the Roster has expired. FHA may require the counselor to retake and pass the HECM exam for reinstatement when the reason for removal from the Roster was particularly egregious. Typically, the counselor will not be required to take and pass the HECM exam; however, FHA must be ensured by the counselor that the HECM counseling requirements are understood and will be followed. An application from a counselor for reinstatement on the Roster will be rejected if the period of the counselor's removal from the Roster has not expired.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Voluntary removal.</E> A HECM counselor will be removed from the Roster upon FHA's receipt of a written request from the counselor.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Other action.</E> Nothing in this section prohibits HUD from taking such other action against a HECM counselor or from seeking any other remedy against a counselor available to HUD by statute or other authority.</P>

                <P>A HECM counselor listed on the Roster must receive, on a continuing basis, training, education, and technical assistance related to HECMs. The HECM counselor must maintain evidence of the successful completion of such continuing education, and such evidence must be made available to FHA upon request. FHA will consider a HECM counselor's successful completion of a HECM course no less than once every 2 years as satisfying the requirements of this section.</P>

                  <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following shall be considered a default under the terms of a mortgage insured under this subpart:</P>
                  <P>(i) Failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under the mortgage (also referred to as a “Monetary Event of Default” in certain mortgage security instruments); or</P>

                  <P>(2) For purposes of a mortgagee filing an insurance claim with the Commissioner, the failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under an operating loss loan or under the original mortgage shall be considered a default under both the operating loss loan and original mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(3) If a default as defined in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section continues for a minimum period of 30 days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance provided for the mortgage, subject to the procedures in this subpart.</P>
                  <P>(4) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the date of default shall be:</P>
                  <P>(i) The date of the first failure to make a monthly payment that subsequent payments by the mortgagor are insufficient to cover when those subsequent payments are applied by the mortgagee to the overdue monthly payments in the order in which they became due; or</P>

                  <P>(b)(1) For multifamily project mortgages for which HUD issued a firm commitment for mortgage insurance before September 1, 2011, and for multifamily project mortgages insured under section 232 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1715w), and section 242 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-7), the following shall be considered a default under the terms of a mortgage insured under this subpart:</P>

                  <P>(ii) Failure to perform any other covenant under the provisions of the mortgage, if the mortgagee, because of such failure, has accelerated the debt.</P>
                  <P>(2) In the case of an operating loss loan, the failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under such loan or under the original mortgage shall be considered a default under both the loan and original mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(3) If such defaults, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, continue for a period of 30 days the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance hereinafter provided.</P>
                  <P>(4) Except for mortgages insured under section 232 of the Act, for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the date of default shall be considered as:</P>
                  <P>(i) The date of the first uncorrected failure to perform a covenant or obligation; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) The date of the first failure to make a monthly payment which subsequent payments by the mortgagor are insufficient to cover when applied to the overdue monthly payments in the order in which they became due.</P>
                  <P>(5) For mortgages insured under section 232 of the Act, for purposes of this section, the date of default shall be considered as:</P>
                  <P>(i) The first date on which the borrower has failed to pay the debt when due as a result of the lender's acceleration of the debt because of the borrower's uncorrected failure to perform a covenant or obligation under the regulatory agreement or security instrument; or</P>

                  <P>(ii) Assist the mortgagor in arranging refinancing to cure the default and avert an insurance claim, if the Commissioner grants the requested (or a shorter) extension of notice filing deadline;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Report to the Commissioner at least monthly on any progress in arranging refinancing;</P>
                  <P>(iv) Cooperate with the Commissioner in taking reasonable steps in accordance with prudent business practices to avoid an insurance claim;</P>
                  <P>(v) Require successors or assigns to certify in writing that they agree to be bound by these conditions for the remainder of the term of the prepayment lock-out or prepayment premium; and</P>

                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of election.</E> For mortgages insured pursuant to section 232 of the Act, if the lender provides notice to the Commissioner of its election either to assign the mortgage to the Commissioner or to acquire and convey title to the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall, not later than 90 calendar days after the expiration of the Eligibility Notice Period, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as the same may have been extended, acknowledge and accept, or reject for cause, pursuant to program requirements, the lender's election, provided that the Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's discretion, extend such 90-day period by no more than an additional 90 calendar days if the Commissioner determines that such an extension is in HUD's interest.</P>

                  <P>(ii) The Commissioner may extend this 30-day period by written notice that a partial payment of insurance claim under § 207.258b is being considered. A mortgagee may consider failure to receive a notice of an extension approval by the end of the 30-day time period a denial of the request for an extension.</P>

                  <P>(iii) The extension shall be for such term, not to exceed 60 days, as the Commissioner prescribes; however, the <PRTPAGE P="308"/>Commissioner's consideration of a partial payment of claim, or the Commissioner's request that a mortgagee accept partial payment of a claim in accordance with § 207.258b, shall in no way prejudice the mortgagee's right to file its application for full insurance benefits within either the 30-day period or any extension prescribed by the Commissioner.</P>

                  <P>(v) The mortgagee has a good right to assign the mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Chattel lien warranty.</E> In assigning its security interest in chattels, including materials, located on the premises covered by the mortgage, or its security interest in building components stored either on-site or off-site at the time of the assignment, the mortgagee shall warrant that:</P>

                  <P>(a) Whenever the Commissioner receives notice under § 207.258 of a mortgagee's intention to file an insurance claim and to assign the mortgage to the Commissioner, the Commissioner may request the mortgagee, in lieu of assignment, to accept partial payment of the claim under the mortgage insurance contract and to recast the mortgage, under such terms and conditions as the Commissioner may determine.</P>
                  <P>(b) The Commissioner may request the mortgagee to participate in a partial payment of claim in lieu of assignment only after a determination that partial payment would be less costy to the Federal government than other reasonable alternatives for maintaining the low- and moderate-income character of the project. This determination shall be based upon the findings listed below and such other findings as the Commissioner deems appropriate:</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgagee is entitled, under § 207.255, to assign the mortgage in exchange for the payment of insurance benefits;</P>
                  <P>(2) The relief resulting from partial payment, when considered with other resources available to the project, would be sufficient to restore the financial viability of the project;</P>
                  <P>(3) The project is, or can at reasonable cost be made, structurally sound;</P>
                  <P>(4) The management of the project is satisfactory to the Commissioner; and</P>
                  <P>(5) The default under the insured mortgage was beyond the control of the mortgagor.</P>
                  <P>(c) Partial payment of a claim under this section shall be made only when:</P>
                  <P>(1) The project is, or potentially could serve as, a low- and moderate-income housing resource;</P>
                  <P>(2) The property covered by the mortgage is free and clear of all liens other than the insured first mortgage and such other liens as the Commissioner may have approved;</P>
                  <P>(3) The mortgagee has voluntarily agreed to accept partial payment of the insurance claim under the mortgage insurance contract and to recast the remaining mortgage amount under terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner; and</P>
                  <P>(4) The mortgagor has agreed to repay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the partial payment, with the obligation secured by a second mortgage on the project containing terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner. The terms of the second mortgage will be determined on a case-by-case basis to assure that the estimated project income will be sufficient to cover estimated operating expenses and debt service on the recast insured mortgage. The Commissioner may provide for postponed amortization of the second mortgage.</P>

                  <P>(d) Payment of insurance benefits under this section shall be in cash. The Commissioner shall waive the deduction of one percent of the mortgage funds advanced to the mortgagor, provided for in § 207.259(b)(2)(iv), with respect to a partial payment of a claim under this section. The items referred <PRTPAGE P="311"/>to in § 207.258(b)(4) shall either be retained by the mortgagee or delivered to the Commissioner in accordance with instructions to be issued by the Commissioner with respect to a partial payment of claim under this section.</P>

                  <P>(e) Lenders receiving a partial payment of claim following the Commissioner's endorsement of the Mortgage for full insurance under parts 251, 252, or 255 of this chapter, will pay HUD a fee in an amount set forth through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice.

                  <P>(iii) An amount equivalent to the debenture interest which would have been earned on the portion of the insurance benefits paid in cash, as of the date such cash payment is made, except that when the mortgagee fails to meet any one of the applicable requirements of §§ 207.256 and 207.258 within the specified time and in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner (or within such further time as the Commissioner may approve in writing), the interest allowance in such cash payment shall be computed only to the date on which the particular required action should have been taken or to which it was extended.</P>
                  <P>(2) By deducting from the total of the items computed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following items:</P>
                  <P>(i) Any amount received by the mortgagee on account of the mortgage after the date of default.</P>

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Amount of payment; conveyance of property.</E> If the property is conveyed to the Commissioner, the insurance benefits shall be paid in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, except that the item set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section shall not be deducted.</P>

Where a conveyance is involved, there shall also be included in the certificate an allowance in a reasonable amount for any necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise and in connection with the conveyance of the property to the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(2) The certificate of claim shall provide for an uncompounded annual interest increment of 3 percent to begin as of the date of either assignment or conveyance.</P>

The debenture interest on the debentures called for redemption shall cease on the semiannual interest payment date designated in the call notice. The Commissioner may include with the notice of redemption an offer to purchase the debentures at par plus accrued interest at any time during the period between the notice of redemption and the redemption date. If the debentures are purchased by the Commissioner after such call and prior to the named redemption date, the debenture interest shall cease on the date of purchase.</P>
                  <P>(4) Mature 20 years from the date thereof.</P>
                  <P>(5) Be issued in such forms and amounts; and be subject to such terms and conditions; and include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe.</P>

                  <P>(6) Bear interest from the date of issue, payable semiannually on the first day of January and the first day of July of each year at the rate in effect as of the date the commitment was issued, or as of the date of initial insurance endorsement of the mortgage, whichever rate is higher. The applicable rates of interest will be published twice each year as a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

                  </P>
                  <P>(7) Debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to an operating loss loan shall bear interest at the rate in effect as of the date the commitment to insure such loan was issued, or as of the date of endorsement for insurance of such loan, whichever rate is the higher, although debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to the original mortgage may bear interest at a different rate.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Mortgagee Time Limits for Supplemental Claims for Additional Insurance Benefits.</E> A mortgagee may not file for any additional payments of its mortgage insurance claim more than six months after the date of final settlement of the insurance claim by the Commissioner. For the purpose of this section, the term final settlement shall mean the payment of the insurance claim (in cash or debentures) or billing for any overpayment of a partial claim that is made by the Commissioner. Final settlement is based upon the submission by the mortgagee of all required documents and information pursuant to part 207 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>This part implements the Housing Counseling Program authorized by section 106 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x). Section 106 authorizes HUD to make grants to, or contract with, public or private organizations to provide a broad range of housing counseling services to homeowners and tenants to assist them in improving their housing conditions and in meeting the responsibilities of tenancy or homeownership. Section 106 also directs HUD to provide housing counseling services only through agencies or individuals that have been certified by HUD as competent to provide such services. The regulations contained in this part prescribe the procedures and requirements by which the Housing Counseling Program will be administered, including the process by which agencies are approved and individuals will be certified to provide the homeownership and rental counseling, as defined by section 106. These regulations apply to all agencies participating in HUD's Housing Counseling Program, and to all organizations or entities that deliver housing counseling, including homeownership counseling or rental housing counseling, required under or provided in connection with HUD programs.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Inactive status.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) HUD may change a participating agency's status to inactive, in lieu of terminations of HUD-approved status or removals from the list of HUD-approved agencies, under certain circumstances that may temporarily impair an agency from complying with its housing counseling plan. An agency's status may be changed to inactive on a case-by-case basis for a period not to exceed 6 months, unless an extension is provided by HUD under paragraph (d) of this section. HUD may change an agency's status through either a request submitted to HUD or as a result of information obtained by the Department. Some of the conditions under which inactive status may be considered include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Loss of counselor(s);</P>
                <P>(2) Damage to facilities by natural disasters that renders the agency unable to function properly;</P>

                <P>(6) Results of performance review.</P>
                <P>(b) Agencies that seek temporary inactive status must submit a request to HUD in writing. Documentation or evidence of the condition(s) that rendered the agency incapable of carrying out its housing counseling plan must be submitted along with the request, if possible. Upon receipt of the request, HUD will review and notify the agency of approval or rejection, in writing. If approved, the agency's name and contact information will be temporarily removed from the HUD-approved Web list of agencies and the telephone referral system.</P>
                <P>(c) The agency must notify HUD in writing and provide supporting documentation or evidence when it is ready to resume operation, or no later than the end of the inactive period.

                <P>(f) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (1) A director, employee, officer, contractor, or agent of a participating agency shall not engage in activities that create a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict would arise if the director, employee, officer, contractor, agent, his or her spouse, child, general partner, or organization in which he or she serves as employee (other than with the participating counseling agency), or with whom he or she is negotiating future employment, has a direct interest in the client as a landlord, broker, or creditor, or originates, has a financial interest in, services, or underwrites a mortgage on the client's property, owns or purchases a property that the client seeks to rent or purchase, or serves as a collection agent for the client's mortgage lender, landlord, or creditor.</P>
                <P>(2) A director, employee, officer, contractor, or agent of a participating agency shall not refer clients to mortgage lenders, brokers, builders, or real estate sales agents or brokers in which the officer, employee, director, his or her spouse, child, or general partner has a financial interest, neither may they acquire the client's property from the trustee in bankruptcy or accept a fee or any other consideration for referring a client to mortgage lenders, brokers, builders, or real estate sales agents or brokers.</P>
                <P>(3) A director, employee, officer, contractor, or agent of a participating agency or any member of his or her immediate family shall avoid any action that might result in, or create the appearance of, administering the housing counseling operation for personal or private gain; providing preferential treatment to any organization or person; or undertaking any action that might compromise the agency's ability to ensure compliance with the requirements of this part and to serve the best interests of its clients.</P>
                <P>(4) HUD may investigate agency practices and may take action to inactivate or terminate the agency's approval or participation in the Housing Counseling program.</P>

Supervisors of the housing counselors must periodically monitor the work of the housing counselors by reviewing client files with the housing counselor to determine the adequacy and effectiveness of the housing counseling. The agency must document these monitoring activities and make <PRTPAGE P="334"/>the documentation available to HUD upon request.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Funding.</E> The agency must maintain a level of funds that enables it to provide housing counseling to at least the required workload of clients every year, whether or not the agency receives HUD funding.</P>

If housing counseling grant funds become available that are to be competitively awarded, HUD will notify the public through a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and by the Internet or other electronic media.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Local funding sources.</E> HUD recommends that approved agencies seek and secure funding from funding sources that may include local and state governments, private foundations, and lending or real estate organizations. Agencies must assure that such arrangements do not violate the provisions regarding conflicts of interest described in § 214.303(e).<PRTPAGE P="335"/>

                <P>(A) Employed by the organization in a permanent or temporary capacity;</P>
                <P>(B) Contracted or retained by the organization; or</P>
                <P>(C) Acting on behalf of, or with the express or apparent authority of, the organization; and</P>
                <P>(D) Has been convicted for a violation under Federal law relating to an election for Federal office.</P>
                <P>(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), a violation under Federal law relating to an election for Federal office includes, but is not limited to, a violation of one or more of the following statutory provisions related to Federal election fraud, voter intimidation, and voter suppression: 18 U.S.C. 241-242, 245(b)(1)(A), 592-611, and 42 U.S.C. 1973.</P>
                <P>(2) A participating agency that provides housing counseling through housing counselors who are not HUD certified housing counselors in accordance with § 214.103(n).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Misuse of housing counseling grant funds.</E> If any participating agency that receives housing counseling grant funds under the Housing Counseling Program is determined by HUD to have used those housing counseling grant funds in a manner that constitutes a material violation of applicable statutes and regulations, or any requirements or conditions under which such funds were provided:</P>
                <P>(1) HUD shall require that, within 12 months after the date of the determination of such misuse, the agency shall reimburse HUD for such misused amounts and return to HUD any such amounts that remain unused or unobligated for use; and</P>
                <P>(2) Such agency shall be ineligible, at any time after the date of such determination of material misuse, to apply for or receive further funds under the Housing Counseling Program.</P>
                <P>(3) The remedies under paragraph (d) of this section are in addition to any other remedies that may be available under law.</P>

                <P>(1) Provide counseling without charge to persons who cannot afford the fees;</P>
                <P>(2) Fees must be commensurate with the level of services provided;</P>

                <P>(d) The agency may also be reimbursed from clients for the direct cost of obtaining copies of clients' credit reports from credit reporting bureaus if this does not cause a hardship for the client. In cases where the participating agency receives a discount for the cost of credit reports, this discount must be passed on to the client.</P>

                <P>(e) Lenders may pay agencies for counseling services, through a lump sum or on a case-by-case basis, provided the level of payment does not exceed a level that is commensurate with the services provided, and is reasonable and customary for the area, and does not violate requirements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).

If the housing counseling agency is a recipient of a HUD housing counseling grant, then the client files for the housing counseling grant year must be retained for 3 years from the date the final grant invoice was paid by HUD.</P>

                  <P>(a) In a case where the mortgage is in default, the mortgagor and the mortgagee may enter into a forbearance agreement for the reduction or suspension of regular mortgage payments for a specified period of time, if the following requirements are met:</P>
                  <P>(1) The mortgage was endorsed for insurance on or after July 7, 1961.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Commissioner determines that the default was due to circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control and that the mortgage probably will be restored to good standing within a reasonable period of time and evidences such determination by written approval of the forbearance agreement.</P>

Within 45 days thereafter, unless a modification or extension of the forbearance agreement has been approved by the Commissioner, the mortgagee shall notify the Commissioner of its election to file an insurance claim and of its decision to either assign the mortgage to the Commissioner or acquire and convey title to the property to the Commissioner. If the mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner, the special insurance benefits prescribed in § 220.765 shall be applicable.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assignment option.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A mortgagee holding a mortgage insured pursuant to a conditional or firm commitment issued on or before November 30, 1983 has the option to assign, transfer and deliver to the Commissioner the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing it, provided the mortgage is not in default at the expiration of 20 years from the date of final endorsement of the credit instrument. In processing a mortgagee's claim for insurance benefits under this section, the Commissioner may direct the mortgagee to assign, transfer and deliver the original credit instrument, and the mortgage securing it, directly to the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Upon such assignment, transfer and delivery, either to the Commissioner or to GNMA, as directed, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive insurance benefits in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(b) The mortgagee may exercise its assignment option within 1 year following the twentieth anniversary of the date the mortgage was endorsed for insurance.</P>
                <P>(c) Upon the exercise of the assignment option the Commissioner shall issue to the assignor mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the assignment, plus accrued interest to such date.</P>
                <P>(d) The debentures issued pursuant to the exercise of an assignment option shall be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner and shall mature 10 years after such date.</P>

                <P>(e) The debentures issued pursuant to the exercise of an assignment option shall bear interest at the <E T="03">going Federal rate</E> at date of issuance. The <E T="03">going Federal rate</E> means the annual rate of interest specified by the Secretary of the Treasury as applicable to the 6-month period which includes the issuance date of the debentures. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine this applicable rate by estimating the average yield to maturity, on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations or prices during the month of May or the month of November, as the case may be, next preceding such 6-month period, on all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a maturity date of 8 to 12 years from the first day of May or November, as the case may be. If there should be no outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having the 8 to 12 year maturity at the time the Secretary of the Treasury is required to determine the debenture rate involved, the obligation next shorter than 8 years and the obligation next longer than 12 years respectively, shall be used.</P>

                <P>(f) Debentures shall bear interest from the date of issue, payable semiannually on the first day of January and the first day of July of each year at the rate in effect on the issue date, a date which shall be established as provided in § 203.410 of this chapter. The interest rate shall be established by the Commissioner in an amount not in <PRTPAGE P="349"/>excess of the annual rate of interest which the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify as applicable to the 6-month period (consisting of January through June, or July through December) which includes the issuance date of such debentures, which applicable rate for each 6-month period shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, at the request of the Commissioner, by estimating the average yield to maturity, on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations or prices during the calendar month next preceding the establishment of such rate of interest, on all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a maturity date of 15 years or more from the first day of such next preceding month, and by adjusting such estimated average annual yield to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.</P>

The computation at the higher rate shall be effective from the first day of the month following the month in which the right to collect interest at the increased rate first accrued, as determined by the mortgagee.</P>
                <P>(2) The mortgagee shall determine the mortgagor's family income, at least biennially, and shall increase the mortgage interest pursuant to the requirements of §§ 221.60(g) and 221.65(d)(5), as appropriate, to comply with the requirements of such sections. The computation at the higher rate shall be effective from the first day of the month following the month in which the mortgagee determines that the mortgagor's family income was increased.</P>
                <P>(b) The mortgagee shall notify the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, within 30 days of making the determination of the right to compute interest at the higher rate, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, of:</P>
                <P>(1) The date on which such right first accrued, and</P>

                <P>(a) In a case where the mortgage is in default, the mortgagor and the mortgagee may enter into a forbearance agreement for the reduction or suspension of regular mortgage payments for a specified period of time, if the following requirements are met:</P>
                <P>(1) The mortgage was endorsed for insurance on or after July 7, 1961.</P>
                <P>(2) The Commissioner determines that the default was due to circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control and that the mortgage probably will be restored to good standing within a reasonable period of time and evidences such determination by written approval of the forbearance agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) The time specified in § 207.258(a) of this chapter, within which a mortgagee shall give the Commissioner written notice of its intention to file an insurance claim, shall be suspended for the period of time specified in the forbearance agreement as long as the mortgagor complies with the requirements of such agreement.</P>
                <P>(c) If the mortgagor fails to meet the requirements of a forbearance agreement or to cure the default under the mortgage at the expiration of the forbearance period, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days, the mortgagee shall notify the Commissioner of such failure. Within 45 days thereafter, unless a modification or extension of the forbearance agreement has been approved by the Commissioner, the mortgagee shall notify the Commissioner of its election to file an insurance claim and of its decision to either assign the mortgage to the Commissioner or to acquire and convey title to the property to the Commissioner. If the mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner, the special insurance benefits prescribed in § 221.763 shall be applicable.</P>

                <P>(a) In the case of a mortgage that provides for payment of interest at the market rate prescribed in § 221.518(a), if the mortgagor fails to meet the requirements of a forbearance agreement or to cure the default under the mortgage at the expiration of the forbearance agreement, the mortgagee shall be entitled to obtain a special insurance payment in cash, in lieu of the insurance benefits otherwise provided under this subpart. To receive the special insurance payment, the mortgagee shall assign the mortgage to the Commissioner in compliance with the requirements of § 207.258(b) of this chapter.</P>

                <P>(b) The special insurance benefit to the mortgagee shall be a cash payment computed in accordance with § 207.259(b) of this chapter, except that in lieu of the allowance for debenture <PRTPAGE P="353"/>interest in § 207.259(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, the payment shall include the amount of the unpaid accrued mortgage interest computed to the date the assignment of the mortgage to the Commissioner is filed for record. In addition, there shall be included in the cash payment an amount equivalent to the debenture interest which would have been earned from the date the mortgage assignment was filed for record to the date the payment is made; except that when the mortgagee fails to meet any of the applicable requirements of § 207.258(b) of this chapter and § 221.761(c) within the specified times and in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner (or within such further time as the Commissioner may approve in writing), such debenture interest allowance shall be computed only to the date on which the particular required action should have been taken.</P>

In processing a mortgagee's claim for insurance benefits under this section, the Commissioner may direct the mortgagee to assign, transfer and deliver the original credit instrument, and the mortgage securing it, directly to the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Upon such assignment, transfer and delivery either to the Commissioner or to GNMA, as directed, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive insurance benefits in accordance with § 221.780.</P>

                <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing, any increase in monthly rent/utility costs and any incidental expenses.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A “displaced person” (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. A “displaced person” shall be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), and, if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the Owner's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or with the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the Owner. A person who is dissatisfied with the Owner's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Responsibility of Owner.</E> (1) The Owner shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24) that the Owner will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The Owner shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the Owner to comply with these provisions.</P>
                <P>(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs also may be paid with funds available from other sources.</P>
                <P>(3) The Owner shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with these provisions. The Owner shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and disability status of displaced persons.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">displaced person</E> means a person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part.

                </P>
                <P>(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after the Owner executes the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the amount approved by HUD;</P>
                <P>(ii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or</P>
                <P>(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>
                <P>(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</P>
                <P>(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable; or</P>
                <P>(iv) Any person, including a person who moves before the Owner's execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition, if the Owner or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition for the assisted project.</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
                <P>(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>
                <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance provided under this section) as a result of the project;</P>
                <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
                <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
                <P>(3) The Owner may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Definition of initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term <E T="03">initiation of negotiations</E> means the Owner's execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition.</P>

                <P>(a) To be eligible for insurance under this part, and except with respect to Supplemental Loans to Finance Purchase and Installation of Fire Safety Equipment (subpart C of this part), if HUD determines the mortgage presents an atypical long-term risk, HUD may require that the borrower establish, at final closing and maintain throughout the term of the mortgage, a long-term debt service reserve account.</P>
                <P>(b) The long-term debt service reserve account, if required, may be financed as part of the initial mortgage amount, provided that the maximum mortgage amount as otherwise calculated is not thereby exceeded.</P>
                <P>(c) The amount required to be initially placed in the long-term debt service reserve account and the minimum long-term balance to be maintained in that account will be determined during underwriting and separately identified in the firm commitment. Although HUD may, when appropriate to avert a mortgage insurance claim, permit the balance to fall below the required minimum long-term balance, the borrower may not take any distribution of mortgaged property except when both the long-term debt service reserve account is funded at the minimal long-term level and such distribution is otherwise permissible.</P>

Borrower shall be deemed to have taken distributions to the extent that surplus cash is negative unless, in conjunction with the calculation of surplus cash, borrower provides to HUD documentation evidencing, to HUD's reasonable satisfaction, a lesser amount of total distributions.

                <P>(a) When a lender for a loan on a healthcare project becomes eligible to file an insurance claim and to assign the mortgage to the Commissioner pursuant to § 207.258, the Commissioner may request the lender, in lieu of assignment, to accept a partial payment of the claim under the mortgage insurance contract and recast the mortgage, under such terms and conditions as the Commissioner may determine.</P>
                <P>(b) The Commissioner may request the lender to participate in a partial payment of claim in lieu of assignment only after a determination that partial payment would be less costly to the Federal Government than other reasonable alternatives for maintaining the project and that would keep the healthcare facility operational to serve community needs. In addition to any findings that may be provided in other guidance, the Commissioner shall base the determination on the findings listed below:</P>
                <P>(1) The lender is entitled, after a default as defined in § 207.255, to assign the mortgage in exchange for the payment of insurance benefits;</P>
                <P>(2) The relief resulting from partial payment, when considered with other resources available to the project, would be sufficient to restore the financial viability of the project;</P>
                <P>(3) The project is or can (at reasonable cost) be made physically sound;</P>
                <P>(4) The current or proposed operator of the facility is satisfactory to the Commissioner, as demonstrated by past experience in operating similar types of healthcare facilities and by state regulatory performance;</P>
                <P>(5) The default under the insured mortgage was beyond the control of the borrower and/or operator, or in the case of a transfer of physical assets (TPA), the proposed borrower or operator, unless the Commissioner determines that any borrower/operator deficiencies giving rise to the default have clearly been addressed; and</P>
                <P>(6) The project is serving as, or potentially could serve as, a needed nursing home, intermediate care facility, board and care home, or assisted living facility.</P>
                <P>(c) Partial payment of a claim under this section shall be made only when:</P>
                <P>(1) The property covered by the mortgage is free and clear of all liens other than the insured first mortgage and such other liens as the Commissioner may have approved;</P>
                <P>(2) The lender has voluntarily agreed to accept a PPC under the mortgage insurance contract and to recast the remaining mortgage amount under terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner; and</P>
                <P>(3) The borrower has agreed to repay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the partial payment, with the obligation secured by a second mortgage on the project containing terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner. The terms of the second mortgage will be determined on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the estimated project income will be sufficient to cover estimated operating expenses and debt service on the recast insured mortgage. The Commissioner may provide for postponed amortization of the second mortgage.</P>
                <P>(d) Payment of insurance benefits under this section shall be in cash.</P>

                <P>(e) A lender receiving a partial payment of claim, following the Commissioner's endorsement of the mortgage for full insurance under 24 CFR part 252, will pay HUD a fee in an amount set forth through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. HUD, in its discretion, may collect this fee or deduct the fee from any payment it makes in the claim process.</P>

                <P>Existing projects (with such repairs and improvements as are determined by the Commissioner to be necessary) are eligible for insurance under this subpart. The project must not require substantial rehabilitation and three years must have elapsed from the date of completion of construction or substantial rehabilitation of the project, or from the beginning of occupancy, whichever is later, to the date of application for insurance. In addition, the project must have attained sustaining occupancy (occupancy that produces income sufficient to pay operating expenses, annual debt service and reserve fund for replacement requirements) as determined by the Commissioner, before endorsement of the project for insurance; alternatively, the borrower must provide an operating deficit fund at the time of endorsement for insurance, in an amount, and under an agreement, approved by the Commissioner.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Maximum mortgage limitations.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Notwithstanding the maximum mortgage limitations set forth in 24 CFR 200.15, a mortgage within the limits set forth in this section shall be eligible for insurance under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Value limit.</E> The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation of not in excess of eighty-five percent (85%) for a profit motivated borrower (ninety percent (90%) for a private nonprofit borrower) of the Commissioner's estimate of the value of the project, including major movable equipment to be used in its operation and any repairs and improvements. The Commissioner's estimate of value shall result from consideration of:</P>
                <P>(1) Estimated market value of the Project by capitalization,</P>
                <P>(2) Estimated market value of the Project by direct sales comparison, and</P>
                <P>(3) Total estimated replacement cost of the Project.</P>
                <P>In the event the mortgage is secured by a leasehold estate rather than a fee simple estate, the value of the property described in the mortgage shall be the value of the leasehold estate (as determined by the Commissioner) which shall in all cases be less than the value of the property in fee simple.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Debt service limit.</E> The insured mortgage shall involve a principal obligation not in excess of the amount that could be amortized by eighty-five percent (85%) for a profit motivated borrower (ninety percent (90%) for a private nonprofit borrower) of the net projected project income available for payment of debt service. Net projected Project income available for debt service shall be determined by reducing the Commissioner's estimated gross income for the Project by a vacancy and collection loss factor and by the cost of all estimated operating expenses, including deposits to the reserve for replacements and taxes.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Project to be refinanced—additional limit.</E> (1) In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the Project is to be refinanced by the insured mortgage, the maximum mortgage amount must not exceed the cost to refinance the existing indebtedness. For the purposes of this requirement:</P>
                <P>(i) The Project shall not have changed ownership subsequent to the date of application, or</P>

                <P>(ii) The Project shall have been sold to a purchaser who has an identity of interest with the seller (as defined by the Commissioner).<PRTPAGE P="370"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The cost to refinance the existing indebtedness will consist of the following items, the eligibility and amounts of which must be determined by the Commissioner:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount required to pay off the existing indebtedness;</P>
                <P>(ii) The amount of the initial deposit for the reserve fund for replacements;</P>
                <P>(iii) Reasonable and customary legal, organization, title, and recording expenses, including mortgagee fees under § 200.41;</P>
                <P>(iv) The estimated repair costs, if any;</P>
                <P>(v) Architect's and engineer's fees, municipal inspection fees, and any other required professional or inspection fees; and</P>
                <P>(vi) The amount of any long-term debt service reserve account required by the Commissioner pursuant to § 232.11.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Project to be acquired—additional limit.</E> In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the project is to be acquired by the borrower and the purchase price is to be financed with the insured mortgage, the maximum amount must not exceed 85 percent for a profit-motivated borrower and 90 percent for a private nonprofit borrower of the cost of acquisition as determined by the Commissioner. The cost of acquisition shall consist of the following items, to the extent that each item (except for paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is paid by the purchaser separately from the purchase price. The eligibility and amounts of these items must be determined in accordance with standards established by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(1) Purchase price is indicated in the purchase agreement;</P>
                <P>(2) An amount for the initial deposit to the reserve fund for replacements;</P>
                <P>(3) Reasonable and customary legal, organizational, title, and recording expenses, including mortgagee fees under § 200.41;</P>
                <P>(4) The estimated repair cost, if any;</P>
                <P>(5) Architect's and engineer's fees, municipal inspection fees, and any other required professional or inspection fees; and</P>
                <P>(6) The amount of any long-term debt service reserve account required by the Commissioner pursuant to § 232.11.</P>

After the preapplication conference an application for a conditional or firm commitment for insurance of a mortgage on a project shall be submitted by the sponsor and an approved mortgagee. Such application shall be submitted to the local HUD Office on a HUD approved form. An application may, at the option of the applicant, be submitted for a firm commitment omitting the conditional commitment stage. No application shall be considered unless accompanied by all exhibits required by the form and program handbooks. An application may be made for a commitment which provides for the insurance of the mortgage upon completion of any improvements or for a commitment which provides, in accordance with standards established by the Commissioner, for the completing of specified repairs and improvements after endorsement.<PRTPAGE P="371"/>

However, where the Commissioner determines the cost of repairs is minimal, the Commissioner may establish a minimum inspection fee that exceeds one percent of the cost of repairs and can periodically increase or decrease this minimum fee.</P>

                <P>(1) The licensed operator of a project shall promptly provide HUD and the mortgagee with a copy of any notification that has placed the licensure, a provider funding source, and/or the ability to admit new residents at risk, and any responses to those notices, provided that HUD may determine certain information to be exempt from this requirement based upon severity level. With respect to the requirements of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) The operator shall deliver to HUD and the mortgagee electronically, within 2 business days after the date of receipt, unless a longer time period is approved by HUD, copies of any and all notices, reports, surveys, and other correspondence (regardless of form) received by the operator from any governmental authority that includes any statement, finding, or assertion that:</P>

                <P>The maintenance of flood insurance coverage on the project by the condominium association will satisfy the requirements of § 203.16a of this chapter if such coverage protects the interest of the mortgagor in the family unit.

                <SUBJECT>Project requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>No mortgage shall be eligible for insurance unless the following requirements are met:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Location of family unit.</E> The family unit shall be located in a project that the Commissioner determines to be acceptable.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Plan of condominium ownership.</E> The project in which the unit is located shall have been committed to a plan of condominium ownership by a deed, or other recorded instrument, that is acceptable to the Commissioner. In the case of condominium documents in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the <PRTPAGE P="375"/>Commissioner will accept documents presented for inscription (recordation) to the Commonwealth Office of the Property Registry so long as the mortgagor obtains a title insurance policy that reflects the condominium regime.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Releases.</E> The family unit shall have been released from any mortgage covering the project or any part of the project.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Certificate by mortgagee.</E> The mortgagee shall certify that:</P>
                <P>(1) The deed of the family unit and the deed or other recorded instrument committing the project to a plan of condominium ownership must comply with legal requirements of the jurisdiction. In the case of condominium documents in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Department will accept documents presented for inscription (recordation) to the Commonwealth Office of Property Registry for certification purposes so long as the mortgagor obtains a title insurance policy that reflects the condominium regime.</P>
                <P>(2) The mortgagor has good marketable title to the family unit, subject only to a mortgage that is a valid first lien on the family unit.</P>
                <P>(3) The family unit is assessed and subject to assessment for taxes pertaining only to that unit.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Conditions and provisions.</E> (1) The Commissioner may require such conditions and provisions as the Commissioner determines are necessary for the protection of consumers and the public interest.</P>
                <P>(2) An application for mortgage insurance of a unit will not be approved if approval would result in less than 80 percent of the FHA-insured mortgages covering units in the project being occupied by mortgagors or co-mortgagors as a principal residence or a secondary residence (as these terms are defined in § 203.18 of this chapter).</P>
                <P>(3) In addition to the other requirements of this section, in order for a project to be acceptable to the Secretary, at least 51 percent of all family units (including units not covered by FHA-insured mortgages) must be occupied by the owners as a principal residence or a secondary residence (as these terms are defined in § 203.18 of this chapter), or must have been sold to owners who intend to meet this occupancy requirement.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations on conversion of rental housing to condominium use.</E> With respect to a family unit in any project that was converted from rental housing, no insurance will be provided under this section unless:</P>
                <P>(1) The conversion occurred more than one year before the application for insurance; or</P>
                <P>(2) The mortgagor or comortgagor was a tenant of a unit in the rental housing project converted to condominium use; or</P>
                <P>(3) The conversion of the property is sponsored by a bona fide tenants' organization representing a majority of the households in the project.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Projects covered by an insured or Secretary-held mortgage.</E> In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, projects which are covered by an FHA-insured project mortgage, or by a mortgage held by the Secretary, must be in compliance with a conversion plan approved by the Commissioner. The conversion plan shall provide for:</P>
                <P>(1) The termination by payment in full of the mortgage or by voluntary termination of the insurance contract covering any HUD/FHA-insured or Secretary-held mortgage on the project, unless the Commissioner determines that the Commissioner's interests, and those of the individuals purchasing the family units, are best served by not requiring the termination of the insurance or payment in full of the mortgage.</P>
                <P>(2) On release of a family unit from the project mortgage, payment shall be made on the outstanding balance of the project mortgage in an amount equal to the share of the balance determined by HUD to be attributable to the family unit.</P>
                <P>(3) The project mortgagee shall certify that, notwithstanding any provisions of the mortgage covering prepayment, no charge is contemplated or has been collected for prepayment in full of the project mortgage.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Projects not covered by an insured or Secretary-held mortgage.</E> In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, projects which are not covered by an <PRTPAGE P="376"/>insured project mortgage or by a Secretary-held mortgage and which have not been approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs for its guaranty, insurance, or direct loan programs shall meet the requirements of this paragraph. Except with the approval of the Commissioner for the purpose of constructing or converting the project in phases or stages, any special right of the declarant (as declarant and not as a unit owner) to do any or all of the following must have expired or must have been waived in a recorded instrument:</P>
                <P>(1) Add land or units to the condominium;</P>
                <P>(2) Convert common elements into additional units or limited common elements;</P>
                <P>(3) Withdraw land from the condominium;</P>
                <P>(4) Use easements through the common elements for the purpose of making improvements within the condominium or within any adjacent land; or</P>
                <P>(5) Convert a unit into two or more units, common elements, or into two or more units and common elements.</P>
                <P>(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, a loan on a single unit in an unapproved condominium project (spot loan) may qualify for mortgage insurance under this part.</P>
                <P>(1) The project must meet the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(i) All units, common elements, and facilities—including those that are part of any master association—must have been completed, and the project cannot be subject to additional phasing or annexation. The project must provide for undivided ownership of common areas by unit owners;</P>
                <P>(ii) Control of the owners' association must have been turned over to the unit purchasers, and the unit purchasers must have been in control for at least one year;</P>
                <P>(iii) At least 90 percent of the total units in the project must have been conveyed to the unit purchasers, and at least 51 percent of the total units in the project must have been conveyed to purchasers who are occupying the units as their principal residences or second homes. No single entity (the same individual, investor group, partnership, or corporation) may own more than 10 percent of the total units in the project;</P>
                <P>(iv) The units in the project must be owned in fee simple or be an eligible leasehold interest, as described in § 234.65, and the unit owners must have sole ownership interest in, and right to the use of, the project's facilities, common elements, and limited common elements including parking, recreational facilities, etc.;</P>
                <P>(v) The project must be covered by hazard, flood, and liability insurance acceptable to the Commissioner;</P>
                <P>(vi) For projects with more than 30 units, no more than 10 percent of the total units in the project may be encumbered by FHA-insured mortgages. (If endorsement would result in more than 10 percent of the units in such a project being encumbered by FHA-insured mortgages, the condominium project must be approved under paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section.) For projects with between 5 and 30 units inclusive, no more than 20 percent of the total units may be encumbered by FHA-insured mortgages. For projects with four units, only one unit may be encumbered by an FHA-insured mortgage under the spot loan procedure of this paragraph (i); and</P>
                <P>(vii) The assumability provisions of § 234.66 must be satisfied.</P>
                <P>(2) Lenders must perform an underwriting analysis and certify that a project satisfies the eligibility criteria for a spot loan in a condominium project that has not been approved by FHA. Lenders may use information from the appraiser, the owners' association, the management company, the real estate broker, and the project developer, but the lender must ensure the accuracy of the information obtained from these sources.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Condition of the multifamily structure.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When a family unit is conveyed or a mortgage is assigned to the Commissioner, the family unit and the common areas and facilities designated for the particular unit shall be undamaged by fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, or boiler explosion, or, as to mortgages insured on or after January 1, 1977, due to failure of the mortgagee to take action as required by § 203.377. If the property has been damaged, either of the following actions shall be taken:</P>
                <P>(1) The property may be repaired prior to its conveyance or prior to the assignment of the mortgage to the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(2) If the prior approval of the Commissioner is obtained, the damaged property may be conveyed or the mortgage assigned to the Secretary without repairing the damage. In such instances, the Commissioner shall deduct from the insurance benefits either his estimate of the decrease in value of the family unit or the amount of any insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, whichever is the greater.</P>
                <P>(b) If the property has been damaged by fire and such property was not covered by fire insurance at the time of the damage, the mortgagee may convey the property or assign the mortgage to the Commissioner without deduction from the insurance benefits for any loss occasioned by such fire if the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(1) The property shall have been covered by fire insurance at the time the mortgage was insured.</P>
                <P>(2) The fire insurance shall have been later cancelled or renewal shall have been refused by the insuring company.</P>

                <P>(3) The mortgagee shall have notified the Commissioner within 30 days (or within such further time as the Commissioner may approve) of the cancellation of the fire insurance or of the refusal of the insuring company to renew the fire insurance. This notification shall have been accompanied by a certification of the mortgagee that diligent efforts were made, but it was unable to obtain fire insurance coverage at reasonably competitive rates <PRTPAGE P="379"/>and that it will continue its efforts to obtain adequate fire insurance coverage at competitive rates, including coverage under the FAIR Plan. A <E T="03">reasonable rate</E> is a rate not more than 25 percent in excess of the rate or the advisory rate filed or used by the principal rating organization doing business in the state. If the property is located in a state which has no rate or advisory rate as provided in the preceding sentence, the mortgagee shall consult the Director of the local HUD office as to a reasonable rate. When hazard insurance coverage cannot be obtained in an amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan but insurance can be obtained in a reduced amount from a FAIR Plan or another insurance carrier, the Secretary will accept the reduced coverage without reduction of mortgage, insurance benefits, if the rates do not exceed the guidelines stated herein. If coverage in any amount is only available at rates in excess of a reasonable rate as defined herein, the mortgagor may but shall not be required to purchase such coverage. If coverage is purchased, the amount of any claim for insurance benefits under this part shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery of hazard insurance benefits by the mortgagee.</P>
                <P>(c) The provisions in paragraph (b) of this section shall be applicable with respect to the insurance of all mortgages whether insured prior to May 8, 1968, or insured on or after such date.</P>
                <P>(d) The mortgagee shall not be liable for damage to the property by waste in connection with mortgage insurance claims paid on or after July 2, 1968. However, the mortgagee shall be responsible for damage to or destruction of security properties on which the loans are in default and which properties are vacant or abandoned due to the mortgagee's failure to take reasonable action to inspect, protect and preserve such properties as required by § 203.377, as to all mortgages insured on or after June 8, 1977, but such responsibility shall not exceed the amount of its insurance claim as to a particular property.</P>

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the mortgagee's certificate or its statement as to damage shall be accepted by the Secretary as establishing the condition of the family unit and the common areas and facilities designated for the particular unit.</P>

                <P>(a) Violations of a restriction based on race, color or creed, even where such restriction provides for a penalty <PRTPAGE P="380"/>of reversion or forfeiture of title or a lien for liquidated damage.</P>
                <P>(b) Easements for public utilities along one or more of the property lines, provided the exercise of the rights thereunder do not interfere with any of the buildings or improvements located on the subject property.</P>
                <P>(c) Encroachment on the subject property by improvements on adjoining property, provided such encroachments do not interfere with the use of any improvements on the subject property.</P>
                <P>(d) Variations between the length of the subject property lines as shown on the application for insurance and as shown by the record or possession lines, provided such variations do not interfere with the use of any of the improvements on the subject property.</P>
                <P>(e) Customary building or use restrictions for breach of which there is no reversion and which have not been violated to a material extent.</P>
                <P>(f) Federal tax liens and rights of redemption arising therefrom if the following conditions are observed. If the mortgagee acquires the property by foreclosure the mortgagee shall give notice to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the foreclosure action. The Commissioner will not object to an outstanding right of redemption in IRS if: (1) The Federal tax lien was perfected subsequent to the date of the mortgage lien, and (2) the mortgagee has bid an amount sufficient to make the mortgagee whole if the property is in fact redeemed by the IRS.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Applicability, cross-reference, and savings clause.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section implements the eligibility requirements for mortgage insurance under the Rental and Cooperative Housing For Lower Income Families Program contained in section 236 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701), as amended. The program authorized the Secretary to insure mortgages to support new construction or rehabilitation of real property to be used primarily for residential rental purposes. A moratorium against issuance of commitments to insure new mortgages under section 236 was imposed January 5, 1973. Section 236(n) prohibits the insurance of mortgages under section 236 after November 30, 1983, except to permit the refinance of a mortgage insured under section 236, or to finance pursuant to section 236(j)(3), the purchase, by a cooperative or nonprofit corporation or association, of a project assisted under section 236. The definition of “family” in 24 CFR 200.3(a) applies to any refinancing of a mortgage insured under section 236, or to financing pursuant to section 236(j)(3) of the purchase, by a cooperative or nonprofit corporation or association of a project assisted under section 236.</P>
                <P>(b) The mortgagor must comply with the financial reporting requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart H.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Savings provision.</E> Any mortgage approved by the Commissioner for insurance pursuant to sections 236(j) or 236(n) of the National Housing Act is governed by subpart A of this part as in effect immediately before May 1, 1996, contained in the April 1, 1995 edition of 24 CFR, parts 220 to 499, and by subparts B through E of this part, except as otherwise provided in this subpart.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Increased distributions to certain limited distribution mortgagors.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Increased distributions.</E> The Commissioner may permit increased distributions of surplus cash in excess of the amounts otherwise permitted by subpart A of this part to limited distribution mortgagors who participate in a HUD-approved initiative or program to preserve below-market housing stock. The increased distributions will be limited to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to HUD instructions. Funds that the mortgagor is authorized to retain under section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered distributions to the mortgagor.<PRTPAGE P="382"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Pre-emption.</E> Any State or local law or regulation that restricts distributions to an amount lower than permitted by subpart A of this part as in effect immediately before May 1, 1996, contained in the April 1, 1995 edition of 24 CFR, parts 220 to 499, or permitted by the Commissioner under this section is preempted to the extent provided by section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Excess income.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Excess Income consists of cash collected as rent from the residents by the mortgagor, on a unit-by-unit basis, that is in excess of the HUD-approved unassisted Basic Rent. The unit-by-unit requirement necessitates that, if a unit has Excess Income, the Excess Income must be returned to HUD. It is not permissible to do an aggregate calculation of the Excess Income for all occupied rent-paying units, and then to offset or subtract from that figure any unpaid rent from occupied or vacant units, before remitting Excess Income to HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirement to return Excess Income.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, or as agreed to by HUD pursuant to a plan of action approved under 24 CFR part 248 or in connection with an adjustment of contract rents under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 Act (1937 Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437f), the mortgagor shall agree to pay monthly to HUD the total of all Excess Income in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Retention of Excess Income for project use</E>—(1) <E T="03">Eligible mortgagors.</E> Any mortgagor of a project receiving Section 236 interest reduction payments may apply to retain Excess Income for project use unless the mortgagor owes prior Excess Income and is not current in payments under a HUD-approved Workout or Repayment Agreement.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Eligible uses.</E> Excess Income retained by a mortgagor for project use may be used for any necessary and reasonable operating expense of the project. Examples of necessary and reasonable operating expenses are:</P>
                <P>(i) Project operating shortfalls, including repair costs;</P>
                <P>(ii) Repair costs identified in the Comprehensive Needs Assessment, including increasing deposits to the Reserve Fund for Replacements to a limit necessary to adequately fund the reserve;</P>
                <P>(iii) Service coordinators;</P>
                <P>(iv) Neighborhood networks located at the project for project residents; and</P>
                <P>(v) Enhanced supportive services for the residents.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Request for approval to retain Excess Income.</E> A mortgagor must submit a written request to retain Excess Income for project use to the local HUD Field Office. The request must describe:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount or percentage of Excess Income requested;</P>
                <P>(ii) The period from which Excess Income is being requested; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The proposed use of the requested Excess Income.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Retention of Excess Income for non-project use</E>—(1) <E T="03">Eligible mortgagors.</E> Any mortgagor of a project receiving Section 236 interest reduction payments may apply to retain Excess Income for non-project use unless the mortgagor owes prior Excess Income and is not current in payments under a HUD-approved Workout or Repayment Agreement or the mortgagor falls within any of the following categories:</P>
                <P>(i) The mortgagor's Reserve for Replacement is not fully funded;</P>
                <P>(ii) The mortgagor's project is not well maintained housing in good condition, as evidenced by:</P>

                <P>(A) Failure to maintain the project in decent, safe, and sanitary condition and in good repair in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="383"/>HUD's Uniform Physical Condition Standards and Inspection Requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G;</P>
                <P>(B) A score below 60 on the physical inspection conducted by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC);</P>
                <P>(C) The existence of uncorrected Exigent Health and Safety (EHS) deficiencies identified by REAC; or</P>

                <P>(iii) The mortgagor has engaged in any one of the following material adverse financial or managerial actions or omissions:</P>
                <P>(A) Materially violating any federal, state, or local law or regulation with regard to the project or any other federally assisted project, including any applicable civil rights law or regulation, after receipt of notice and an opportunity to cure;</P>
                <P>(B) Materially breaching a contract for assistance under section 8 of the 1937 Act, after receipt of notice and an opportunity to cure;</P>
                <P>(C) Materially violating any applicable regulatory or other agreement with HUD or a participating administrative entity, after receipt of notice and an opportunity to cure;</P>
                <P>(D) Repeatedly and materially violating any federal, state, or local law or regulation, including any applicable civil rights law or regulation, with regard to the project or any other federally assisted project;</P>
                <P>(E) Repeatedly and materially breaching a contract for assistance under section 8 of the 1937 Act;</P>
                <P>(F) Repeatedly and materially violating any applicable regulatory or other agreement with HUD or a participating administrative entity, including failure to submit audited financial statements or required tenant data;</P>
                <P>(G) Repeatedly failing to make mortgage payments at times when project income was sufficient to maintain and operate the project;</P>
                <P>(H) Materially failing to maintain the project in decent, safe, and sanitary condition and in good repair after receipt of notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure; or</P>
                <P>(I) Committing any actions or omissions that would warrant suspension or debarment by HUD.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Eligible uses.</E> Excess Income retained by a mortgagor for non-project use may be used for any purpose, except that the non-project use of Excess Income by a nonprofit entity mortgagor is limited to activities that carry out the entity's nonprofit purpose.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Request for approval to retain Excess Income.</E> A mortgagor must submit a written request to retain Excess Income for non-project use to the local HUD Field Office. The request must describe:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount or percentage of Excess Income requested; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The period from which Excess Income is being requested.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Timing of request to retain Excess Income</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a mortgagor must submit a request to retain Excess Income at least 90 days before the beginning of each fiscal year before any other date during a fiscal year that the mortgagor plans to begin retaining Excess Income for that fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific ongoing purpose.</E> A mortgagor requesting approval to retain Excess Income for a specific, ongoing purpose where the purpose extends beyond the current fiscal year may submit a request that describes the proposed use of Excess Income and advises that the intended use will extend beyond the current fiscal year. If HUD approves the request, following review of the request in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, the mortgagor will not be required to submit a new request each fiscal year provided the use of Excess Income remains the same. The mortgagor will still be required to submit the Monthly Report of Excess Income and the end of year narrative under paragraph (g) of this section. If the use of Excess Income changes, the mortgagor must notify HUD of the change and submit a new request to retain Excess Income 90 days prior to the date the mortgagor intends to begin retaining Excess Income for the new purpose.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">HUD review and response procedure.</E> HUD will review a mortgagor's request <PRTPAGE P="384"/>to retain Excess Income and issue a letter of approval or denial as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Approval letter.</E> The approval letter from HUD permitting the mortgagor to retain Excess Income must, at a minimum, assert:</P>
                <P>(i) Retention rights are for the time specified in the approval letter, but cannot extend beyond the current fiscal year except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) Failure of the mortgagor to maintain the Reserve for Replacement account in a fully funded amount at all times is grounds for HUD to rescind the approval;</P>
                <P>(iii) Failure of the mortgagor to maintain the project in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition and in good repair at all times is grounds for HUD to rescind the approval;</P>
                <P>(iv) If the Excess Income requested for project use is not used for the proposed purpose described in the mortgagor's request, the income must be returned to HUD, unless the mortgagor has obtained prior HUD approval for the alternate use; and</P>
                <P>(v) The failure of a mortgagor to return retained Excess Income to HUD for not complying with applicable requirements is a violation of the Regulatory Agreement for which there are enforcement remedies that HUD may take.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Denial letter.</E> A letter from HUD denying a mortgagor's request to retain Excess Income must cite the specific reasons for denial and state what requirements the mortgagor must meet to receive HUD's approval to retain Excess Income.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Environmental review.</E> Before approving a request to retain Excess Income for project use, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required under 24 CFR part 50 for activities that are not excluded under 24 CFR 50.19(b).</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Post-approval requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Monthly report.</E> A mortgagor approved to retain Excess Income must continue to prepare and submit to HUD a revised Form HUD-93104, Monthly Report of Excess Income, or successor form.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Other reporting requirements.</E> A mortgagor that retains Excess Income for project use must provide HUD, on an annual basis, two copies of a narrative description of the amount and the uses made of Excess Income during the prior fiscal year of the project. The calendar year or HUD's fiscal year is not relevant to this requirement unless the fiscal year of the project coincides with the calendar year or HUD's fiscal year. HUD may request additional follow-up information on a case-by-case basis. The report must contain the following certification: “I certify that (1) the amount of Excess Income retained and used was for the purposes approved by HUD; (2) all eligibility requirements for retaining Excess Income were satisfied for the entire reporting period; and (3) all the facts and data on which this report is based are true and accurate. Warning: HUD will prosecute false claims and statements. Conviction may result in criminal or civil penalties, or both (18 U.S.C. 1001, 1010, 1012; and 31 U.S.C. 3729 and 3802).”</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Return of remitted Excess Income</E>—(1) <E T="03">For project use.</E> A mortgagor that is eligible to retain Excess Income for project use under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may apply for the return of Excess Income remitted to HUD since October 21, 1998, in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A mortgagor that is eligible to retain Excess Income for project use may not apply for the return of Excess Income that was:</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">For non-project use.</E> A mortgagor that is eligible to retain Excess Income for non-project use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may apply for the return of Excess Income remitted to HUD since October 21, 1998, in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section. A mortgagor that is eligible to retain Excess Income for non-project use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may not apply to retain Excess Income that was:</P>

                <P>(i) Repaid in accordance with a Workout or Repayment Agreement with HUD; or<PRTPAGE P="385"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Generated between October 1, 2000, and October 27, 2000, by projects with state agency non-insured Section 236-assisted mortgages or HUD-held Section 236 mortgages.</P>

                <P>(i) <E T="03">HUD withdrawal of approval to retain Excess Income</E>—(1) <E T="03">Bases for withdrawal of approval.</E> HUD may withdraw approval for any of the following reasons:</P>
                <P>(i) If, at any time after approval, a mortgagor fails to meet the eligibility requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section, as applicable;</P>
                <P>(ii) If the mortgagor does not use the Excess Income requested for project use for purposes and activities as approved by HUD; or</P>
                <P>(iii) If at any time during the fiscal year that such approval is in effect, mortgagor, approved to retain Excess Income for non-project use, fails to maintain the project in decent, safe, and sanitary condition and in good repair, or maintain the Reserve for Replacement account in a fully funded amount.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification of withdrawal of approval.</E> HUD will notify the mortgagor by certified mail that the authorization to retain Excess Income is withdrawn. The notification will state:</P>
                <P>(i) Specific reasons for HUD's withdrawal of approval;</P>
                <P>(ii) The effective termination date, which may be the date of the violation resulting in the withdrawal or the date of HUD's determination that the mortgagor was out of compliance;</P>
                <P>(iii) The amount of retained Excess Income improperly retained that must be returned to HUD; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The actions that the mortgagor must take to restore the authorization to retain Excess Income.</P>

The letter must include documentation supporting a review of the withdrawal.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">HUD response.</E> Within 30 days of HUD's receipt of the mortgagor's request for reconsideration, HUD will make a final determination and respond in writing to the mortgagor. HUD's response may:</P>

A Qualified Tenant or family shall not be disqualified if, after that date, it moved from one unit to another unit in the same project. For these purposes, units in buildings located on adjacent sites and managed as one project will be considered part of the same project even if they have separate project numbers and separate mortgages.</P>

                <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Total Tenant Payment payable by a Qualified Tenant who continues to receive assistance in the same project shall not be increased by more than 10 percent during any 12-month period as a result of application of the percentages in paragraph (c) of this section, and application of the revised definitions in §§ 236.2 and 236.3. However, this 10 percent limit does not apply to Families subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, provided that the welfare agency includes as the housing component of the Family's grant an amount equal to their entire rent payment, without reduction. The Total Tenant Payment may be increased by more than 10 percent during any 12-month period to the <PRTPAGE P="392"/>extent that the portion of such increase above 10 percent is attributable to increases in income or changes in family composition or family circumstances that are unrelated to the factors set out in this paragraph (d)(2).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Utility reimbursement.</E> Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement shall be paid to the Qualified Tenant. If the tenant and the utility company consent, the owner may pay the Utility Reimbursement jointly to the Qualified Tenant and the utility company, or directly to the utility company.</P>

                <P>(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after the mortgagor executes the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the amount approved by HUD;</P>

                <P>(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>

                <P>(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling <PRTPAGE P="395"/>unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</P>

                <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
                <P>(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>
                <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition and, before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance provided under this section) as a result of the project;</P>
                <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
                <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project;</P>
                <P>(3) The mortgagor may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.</P>

This section authorizes the Secretary to provide insurance for an equity loan as a vehicle for the owner of an eligible multifamily project to capture a portion of the project's equity, in connection with a plan of action approved by the Commissioner under ELIHPA.</P>
                <P>(b) Section 602 of the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (“LIHPRHA”) amended section 241 by expanding its scope to include both equity loans for owners, and acquisition loans for purchasers, under a plan of action approved under the provisions of the 1990 Act, and by making other changes. The provisions of section 241(f) as amended by LIHPRHA are applicable to owners with plans of action being processed under part 248, subpart B of this chapter, which implements LIHPRHA.</P>
                <P>(c) The provisions of section 241(f) of the Act as they were in effect prior to LIHPRHA remain in effect for owners with plans of action being processed under part 248, subpart C of this chapter, which implements ELIHPA.</P>

                <P>(d) The insurance of an equity loan or acquisition loan under subpart E of this part may be provided only as a <PRTPAGE P="410"/>specific element of a plan of action approved by the Commissioner under part 248 of this chapter and is not available under any other departmental program.</P>
                <P>(e) Unless otherwise indicated, the provisions of subparts E and F of this part are applicable to loans insured in connection with plans of action being processed under either subpart B or C of part 248 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(f) An owner or purchaser may obtain both a rehabilitation loan under subpart A of this part and an equity loan or acquisition loan under subpart E of this part.</P>

The mortgagor shall be required to make contributions to the MRF such that, with fund earnings, the MRF will build to one year of debt service at 5 years following commencement of amortization, increasing thereafter to 2 years of debt service on and after 10 years following commencement of amortization according to a schedule established by HUD, unless HUD determines that a different schedule of contributions is appropriate based on the mortgagor's risk profile, reimbursement structure, or other characteristics. In particular, hospitals that receive cost-based reimbursement may be required to have MRFs that build to more than 2 years of debt service. Expenditures from the fund are made at HUD's sole discretion or in accordance with the mortgagor's MRF Schedule. Upon termination of insurance, the balance of the MRF shall be returned to the mortgagor, provided that all obligations to HUD have been met.</P>

                <P>(a) Some existing capital debt may be refinanced with the proceeds of a section 242-insured loan; however, the hard costs of construction and equipment must represent at least 20 percent of the total mortgage amount.</P>
                <P>(b) In the case of a loan insured under Section 242/223(f), there is no requirement for hard costs. However, if there are hard costs, such costs must total less than 20 percent of the total mortgage amount.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Applications.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Application process</E>—(1) <E T="03">Market need.</E> The approval process entails a determination of the market need of the proposal and stresses, on a market-wide basis, the impact of the proposed facility on, and its relationship to, other health care facilities and services (particularly other hospitals with mortgages insured under this part and hospitals that have a disproportionate share of Medicaid and uninsured patients or provide a substantial amount of charity care); the number and percentage of any excess beds; and demographic projections. Generally, Section 242 insurance may support start-up hospitals or major expansions of existing hospitals only if existing hospital capacity or services are clearly not adequate to meet the needs of the population in the service area.</P>
                <P>(i) If the state has an official procedure for determining need for hospitals, HUD shall require that such procedure be followed before the application for insurance is submitted, and that the application document that need has also been established under that procedure.</P>
                <P>(ii) The following factors are relevant in evaluating market need for the project and should be addressed, as applicable, in the study of market need and feasibility submitted with the application. Because each hospital presents a unique situation, there is no formula or cutoff level that applies to all applications:</P>
                <P>(A) Service area definition;</P>
                <P>(B) Existing or proposed hospital;</P>
                <P>(C) Designation as sole community provider, Critical Access Hospital, or rural referral center;</P>
                <P>(D) Community-wide use rates (discharges and days/1000);</P>
                <P>(E) Statewide use rates (for benchmarking purposes);</P>
                <P>(F) Current population and 5-year projection by age cohort;</P>
                <P>(G) Staffed versus licensed beds;<PRTPAGE P="425"/>
                </P>
                <P>(H) Applicant hospital's occupancy rate;</P>
                <P>(I) Competitors' occupancy rates;</P>
                <P>(J) Outpatient volume;</P>
                <P>(K) Availability of emergency services;</P>
                <P>(L) Teaching hospital status;</P>
                <P>(M) Services offered by hospitals in the service area;</P>
                <P>(N) Migration of patients out of the service area;</P>
                <P>(O) Planned construction at other facilities in the region;</P>
                <P>(P) Historical market share by major service category;</P>
                <P>(Q) Disproportionate Share Hospital designation; and</P>
                <P>(R) Distance to other hospitals.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating margin and debt service coverage ratio.</E> (i) Hospitals with an aggregate operating margin of less than 0.00 when calculated from the three most recent annual audited financial statements are not eligible for Section 242 insurance, unless HUD determines, based on the financial data in those statements, that the hospital has achieved a financial turnaround resulting in a positive operating margin in the most recent year, calculated using classifications of items as operating or non-operating in accordance with guidance that shall be provided in written directives by HUD. In any event, HUD shall not issue an insurance commitment for any hospital in a turnaround situation that has not achieved 2 consecutive years of positive operating margin immediately prior to issuance of the commitment.</P>
                <P>(ii) Hospitals with an average debt service coverage ratio of less than 1.25 in the 3 most recent audited years are not eligible for Section 242 insurance, unless HUD determines, based on the audited financial data, that the hospital has achieved a financial turnaround resulting in a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.4 in the most recent year. In cases of refinancing at a lower interest rate, HUD may authorize the use of the projected debt service requirement in lieu of the historical debt service in calculating the debt service coverage ratios for each of the prior 3 years. In cases where HUD authorizes the use of the projected debt service requirement in lieu of the historical debt service to determine the debt service coverage ratio, hospitals must have an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.4 or greater.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Threshold requirements—refinancing candidates.</E> For an application to be considered for refinancing pursuant to Section 223(f), a hospital must meet the following requirements in lieu of those described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) The hospital must have an aggregate operating margin and average debt service coverage ratio as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) The hospital must have an aggregate operating margin of at least zero percent, when calculated from the three most recent annual audited financial statements.</P>
                <P>(B) The hospital must have an average debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.4 when calculated from the three most recent annual audited financial statements; or</P>
                <P>(ii) If the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and/or (B) of this section are not satisfied, HUD will recast the operating margin and debt service coverage ratio for prior periods by applying its estimate of the projected interest rate at the time the mortgage is expected to close in lieu of the historical interest rate(s).</P>
                <P>(iii) In performing the calculations called for in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, if HUD finds that performance in one of the three years was affected by exceptional, one-time events that substantially altered financial performance, HUD may calculate the three-year performance based on the four most recent years with the unusual year omitted.</P>
                <P>(iv) The hospital must document that it provides an essential healthcare service to the community in which it operates and that its financial performance would be materially improved by refinancing its existing capital debt.</P>

                <P>(v) The hospital may show that it provides an essential healthcare service to the community in which it operates by submitting an analysis quantifying how the community in which it presently operates would suffer from inadequate access to an essential healthcare service that the hospital presently provides if the hospital were no longer in operation.<PRTPAGE P="426"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vi) The hospital may show that its financial performance would be materially improved by providing documentation of the following:</P>
                <P>(A) There are limited comparable affordable refinancing vehicles available to the hospital; and,</P>
                <P>(B) The hospital meets three of the following seven criteria:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The proposed refinancing would reduce the hospital's total operating expenses by at least 0.25 percent;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The interest rate of the proposed refinancing would be at least 0.5 percentage points less than the interest rate on the debt to be refinanced;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The interest rate on the debt that the hospital proposes to refinance has increased by at least one percentage point at any time since January 1, 2008, or is very likely to increase by at least one percentage within one year of the date of application;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The hospital's annual total debt service is in excess of 3.4 percent of total operating revenues, based on its most recent audited financial statement;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The hospital has experienced a withdrawal or expiration of its credit enhancement facility, or the lender providing its credit enhancement facility has been downgraded, or the hospital can demonstrate that one of these events is imminent;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The hospital is party to bond covenants that are substantially more restrictive than the Section 242 mortgage covenants; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) There are other circumstances that demonstrate that the hospital's financial performance would be materially improved by refinancing its existing capital debt.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Financial feasibility.</E> The approval process entails a determination of the financial feasibility of the proposal, i.e., a determination that it is probable that the proposed mortgagor will be able to meet its debt service requirements during the period projected. It includes analysis of the reimbursement structure of the proposed hospital (including patient/payer mix); actions of competitors; and the probable projected impact on the proposed hospital of general health care system trends, such as the development of alternative health care delivery systems and new reimbursement methods. In addition to historical operating margin, determination of financial feasibility includes, but is not limited to, evaluation of the following factors, which the application must address and which HUD will review:</P>
                <P>(i) Current and projected gains from operations and a manageable debt load using reasonable assumptions;</P>
                <P>(ii) Current debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 or higher and projected debt service coverage ratio of 1.40 or higher;</P>
                <P>(iii) Cushion in the balance sheet sufficient to demonstrate the ability to withstand short periods of net operating losses without jeopardizing financial viability;</P>
                <P>(iv) Patient utilization forecasts (including average length of stay, case intensity, discharges, area-wide use rates) that are consistent with the hospital's historical trends, future service mix, market trends, population forecasts, and business climate;</P>
                <P>(v) The hospital's demonstrated ability to position itself to compete in its marketplace;</P>
                <P>(vi) Organizational affiliations or relationships that help optimize financial, clinical, and operational performance;</P>
                <P>(vii) Management's demonstrated ability to operate effectively and efficiently, and to develop effective strategies for addressing problem areas;</P>
                <P>(viii) Systems in place to monitor hospital operations, revenues, and costs accurately and in a timely manner;</P>
                <P>(ix) A Board that is appropriately constituted and provides effective oversight;</P>
                <P>(x) Required licensures and approvals; and</P>
                <P>(xi) Favorable ratings from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or other organizations acceptable to HUD.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Preliminary Review.</E> A Preliminary Review is a general overview of the acceptability of a potential mortgagor performed at the request of a hospital, a financial consultant representing a hospital, or a lender, to identify any factors that would likely cause an application to be rejected, should an application be submitted.<PRTPAGE P="427"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The purpose of the preliminary review is for HUD to identify any obvious factors that would cause an application to be rejected, before the potential mortgagor or mortgagee expends resources to prepare one. The hospital, financial consultant, or lender shall submit a preliminary information package to HUD that provides evidence of statutory eligibility, market need, financial strength, and such other documentation as HUD may require. The scope of the preliminary review does not include approval of any specific site in the community.</P>
                <P>(ii) If HUD identifies factors that would cause an application to be rejected, HUD shall issue a Preliminary Review Letter notifying the potential applicant that an application for mortgage insurance would probably not be successful and providing the reasons for this decision. Also, no further request from the proposed applicant for a Preliminary Review shall be entertained for a period of one year from the date of HUD's notification. HUD may grant an exception to this one-year limitation if, during the year, there is a major change in the circumstances that caused HUD to determine that the project would be rejected. For example, if the sole reason for HUD's determination was the hospital's failure to meet the historical operating margin test, and a new audited annual financial statement contains results that would cause the hospital to meet the test, then the lender may request a new Preliminary Review within one year of HUD's notification.</P>
                <P>(iii) If HUD does not identify any factors that would cause an application to be rejected, HUD shall issue a Preliminary Review Letter advising the potential applicant that there appears to be no bar to the applicant's proceeding to the next step in the application process, provided that if a complete application is not received by HUD within one year following the date of HUD's letter, another Preliminary Review may be required, at HUD's discretion, before the application process may proceed.</P>
                <P>(iv) The Commissioner's determination in the preliminary review phase that no factors have been identified that would cause an application to be rejected shall in no way be construed as an indication that a subsequent application will be approved.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Preapplication meeting.</E> The next step in the application process is the preapplication meeting (this step is optional, at HUD's discretion, in Section 242/223(f) cases). At HUD's discretion, this meeting may be held at HUD Headquarters in Washington, DC, or at another site agreeable to HUD and the potential applicant. The preapplication meeting is an opportunity for the potential mortgagor to summarize the proposed project and refinancing, if any; for HUD to summarize the application process; and for issues that could affect the eligibility or underwriting of the project to be identified and discussed to the extent possible. Following the meeting, HUD may:</P>
                <P>(i) Advise the potential applicant that there appears to be no bar to submitting an application for mortgage insurance; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Identify issues that must be resolved before a full application should be submitted for processing.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Application contents.</E> The application for mortgage insurance shall include exhibits that follow such guidance as to content and format that HUD shall provide from time to time. The application shall include:</P>
                <P>(1) A description of the proposed sources and uses of funds;</P>
                <P>(2) A description of the mortgagor entity, its ownership structure, and its directors and managers;</P>
                <P>(3) A description of the project, the business plan of the hospital, and how the project will further that plan, or, for applications pursuant to Section 223(f), a description of any limited rehabilitation to be financed with mortgage proceeds and how that limited rehabilitation will affect the hospital;</P>
                <P>(4) Historical audited financial statements and interim year-to-date financial results (for existing hospitals);</P>

                <P>(5) A study of market need and financial feasibility, addressing the factors listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section, (whichever applies), with assumptions and financial forecast clearly presented. The study should be prepared by a certified public accounting firm acceptable to HUD. In the case of an application for Section <PRTPAGE P="428"/>242/223(f) mortgage insurance, the study may not be required to address market need and there may be no requirement for involvement of a certified public accounting firm;</P>
                <P>(6) Architectural plans and specifications in sufficient detail to enable a reasonable estimate of cost (not applicable to a Section 242/223(f) application, except when architectural plans and specifications are requested by HUD);</P>
                <P>(7) Evidence that the hospital will be located in a state or political subdivision of a state with reasonable minimum standards of licensure and methods of operation for hospitals and satisfactory assurance that such standards will be applied and enforced with respect to the hospital;</P>
                <P>(8) If the state has an official procedure for determining need for hospitals, evidence that such procedure has been followed and that need has been established under that procedure;</P>
                <P>(9) A Phase I environmental report; and</P>
                <P>(10) Such other exhibits as HUD shall require based upon the facts pertaining to the particular case.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee.</E> An application fee of $1.50 per thousand dollars of the amount of the loan to be insured shall be paid to HUD at the time the application is submitted to HUD for approval.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Filing of application.</E> An application for insurance of a mortgage on a project shall be submitted on an approved FHA form, by an approved mortgagee and by the sponsors of such project, to FHA.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Complete application.</E> Only technically complete applications will be processed. Partial applications cannot be processed. Upon determination that an application is complete, HUD shall issue a Completeness Letter to the applicant stating that the application is complete.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Application review.</E> Upon receipt of a complete application, HUD shall evaluate the application to determine if eligibility, market need, financial feasibility, and compliance with applicable regulations (including but not limited to federal environmental regulations, wage rate regulations, and health care regulations) have been demonstrated, and to evaluate any other factors, including but not limited to risk to the Insurance Fund, that should be considered in determining if the application for mortgage insurance should be approved. As a part of this review, HUD may solicit the advice of private consultants and expert staff in the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies. Based on review of the complete application, HUD may request additional information from the applicant. The timeliness of the applicant's submission of the additional information may affect the approval or disapproval of the application. The Commissioner's decision shall be communicated in the form of a Commitment Letter or a Rejection Letter. HUD will not issue a Commitment Letter until HUD completes the environmental review under 24 CFR 242.79.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Issuance of commitment.</E> Upon approval of an application for insurance, a commitment shall be issued by HUD setting forth the terms and conditions under which an insurance endorsement shall be issued for the hospital. The commitment shall include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A commitment for insurance of advances reflecting the mortgage amount, interest rate, mortgage term, date of commencement of amortization, and other requirements pertaining to the mortgage and construction project;</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of an application for Section 242/223(f) insurance where advances are not needed for funding any limited rehabilitation: a commitment for insurance upon completion, reflecting the mortgage amount, interest rate, mortgage term, date of commencement of amortization, and other requirements pertaining to the mortgage and to any limited rehabilitation;</P>
                <P>(3) HUD's computation of the replacement cost and maximum insurable mortgage amount;</P>
                <P>(4) Financial requirements for closing;</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Type of commitment.</E> The commitment will provide for the insurance of advances of mortgage funds during construction. In the case of a commitment for Section 242/223(f) insured refinancing or acquisition financing of an existing hospital, the commitment shall provide for insurance upon completion unless insured advances are needed for funding any limited rehabilitation approved by HUD, in which case the commitment shall provide for insurance of advances.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Term of commitment.</E> (1) The initial commitment shall be issued for a period of 90 days.</P>
                <P>(2) The term of a commitment may be extended in such manner as HUD may prescribe, provided, however, that the combined term of the original commitment and any extensions do not exceed 180 days.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Commitment fee.</E> A commitment fee that, when added to the application fee, will aggregate $3 per thousand dollars of the amount of the loan set forth in the commitment, shall be paid within 30 days of the date of issuance of the commitment. If such fee is not paid within this 30-day period, the commitment shall automatically terminate.</P>

This work must be requested by both the hospital and the lender to be approved. Such work may be eligible to be financed with insured mortgage proceeds if the application is approved and the work complies with all specified conditions of HUD as set forth in a written agreement between the hospital and HUD. It is understood that in some cases the application submitted in order for pre-commitment work to begin may not be complete in all respects. However, at a minimum, the application shall include the approved FHA application form, the application fee (based on the amount of the total proposed insured loan), the inspection fee (based on the cost of the pre-commitment work), a project description of the pre-commitment work and its relation to the total project, and plans and specifications for the proposed pre-commitment work in sufficient detail to allow HUD to conduct its architectural and engineering review and obtain the necessary previous participation information and evidence of compliance with federal and state environmental regulations. Such work can commence only after the review of the work and concurrence by the lender and HUD, including previous participation review. HUD will not approve such request until it has completed the environmental review under 24 CFR 242.79.

A request shall be accompanied by documentation required by HUD. That documentation shall include:</P>

                <P>(1) A justification explaining the urgent and compelling circumstances that make it necessary to begin construction without waiting for the application process to run its course. The justification must specify the harm the hospital would suffer from waiting.<PRTPAGE P="436"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) A plan detailing how the hospital will finance the limited construction if the application for mortgage insurance is denied.</P>
                <P>(3) A statement that financing the limited construction by means other than a HUD-insured mortgage in the event the application is denied will impose no significant financial hardship on the hospital. The statement shall be accompanied by supporting historical and projected financial data.</P>
                <P>(4) A statement that the hospital recognizes that HUD's agreement to include the cost of the limited construction in a subsequently approved application does not in any way indicate that the application will be approved.</P>
                <P>(5) A resolution of the governing body (or, at HUD's discretion, the executive committee of the governing body) of the mortgagor attesting to paragraphs (c)(1) through (4).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Early Start.</E> Subsequent to the issuance of a commitment, if the hospital and lender request the commencement of the project, the work may commence after the review and approval of the request by HUD, including the agreement by the hospital and the lender to any conditions that HUD may require. Any work undertaken prior to the initial endorsement shall be at the sole risk of the hospital.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Prepayment of inspection fee.</E> The hospital shall pay a non-refundable inspection fee to HUD before the work described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section commences. The fee shall be based on the amount of the pre-commitment and/or early start work requested to be included in the insured mortgage loan.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">No expressed or implied intent.</E> Approval to proceed under paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section shall in no way be construed as indicating any intent, expressed or implied, on the part of HUD to approve, disapprove, or make any undertaking or promise whatsoever with respect to the application or with respect to any commitment for mortgage insurance. Any work under paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section shall be undertaken at the sole risk and responsibility of the hospital.</P>

                <P>(a) Building components. In insured advances for building components stored off-site, the term building component shall mean any manufactured or pre-assembled part of a structure that HUD has specifically identified for incorporation into the property and has designated for off-site storage because it is of such size or weight that:</P>
                <P>(1) Storage of the number of components required for timely construction progress at the construction site is impractical, or</P>
                <P>(2) Weather damage or other adverse conditions prevailing at the construction site would make storage at the site impractical or unduly costly.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Storage.</E> (1) An insured advance may be made for up to 90 percent of the invoice value (to exclude costs of transportation and storage) of the building components stored off-site, if the components are stored at a location approved by the mortgagee and HUD.</P>
                <P>(2) Each building component shall be adequately marked so as to be readily identifiable in the inventory of the off-site location. Each component shall be kept together with all other building components of the same manufacturer intended for use in the same project for which insured advances have been made and separate and apart from similar units not for use in the project.</P>
                <P>(3) Storage costs, if any, shall be borne by the contractor.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibility for transportation, storage, and insurance of off-site building components.</E> The general contractor of the insured mortgaged property shall have the responsibility for:<PRTPAGE P="437"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Insuring the components in the name of the mortgagor while in transit and storage; and</P>
                <P>(2) Delivering or contracting for the delivery of the components to the storage area and to the construction site, including payment of freight.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Advances.</E> (1) Before an advance for a building component stored off-site is insured:</P>
                <P>(i) The mortgagor shall:</P>
                <P>(A) Obtain a bill of sale for the component;</P>
                <P>(B) Give the mortgagee a security agreement; and</P>
                <P>(C) File a financing statement in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The mortgagee shall warrant to HUD that the security instruments are a first lien on the building components covered by the instruments except for such other liens or encumbrances as may be approved by HUD.</P>
                <P>(2) Before each advance for building components stored off-site is insured, the mortgagor's architect shall certify to HUD that the components, in their intended use, comply with HUD-approved contract plans and specifications. Under those circumstances permitted by HUD in which there is no architect, compliance with the HUD-approved contract plans and specifications shall be determined by HUD.</P>
                <P>(3) Advances may be made only for components stored off-site in a quantity required to permit uninterrupted installation at the site.</P>
                <P>(4) At no time shall the invoice value of building components being stored off-site, for which advances have been HUD insured, represent more than 50 percent of the total estimated construction costs for the insured mortgaged project as specified in the construction contract. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and other regulatory requirements that set bonding requirements, the percentage of total estimated construction costs insured by advances under this section may exceed 25 percent but not 50 percent if the mortgagor furnishes assurance of completion in the form of a corporate surety bond for the payment and performance each in the amount of 100 percent of the amount of the construction contract. In no event will insurance of advances for components stored off-site be made in the absence of a payment and a performance bond.</P>
                <P>(5) No single advance that is to be insured shall be in an amount less than $10,000.</P>

                <P>The Commissioner shall require assurance of completion of off-site public utilities and streets in all cases, except where a municipality or other public body has by agreement acceptable to HUD agreed to install such utilities and streets without cost to the mortgagor. Where such assurance is required, it shall be in the form of a cash escrow deposit, a letter of credit, the retention of a specified amount of mortgage proceeds by the mortgagee, or a combination thereof. In any case, the amount of deposit or retained cash (or both) must be sufficient to cover the cost of off-site utilities and streets. If a cash escrow is used, it shall be deposited with the mortgagee or with an acceptable trustee or escrow agent designated by the mortgagee. If mortgage proceeds are used, the mortgagee shall retain under terms approved by HUD, rather than disburse at the initial closing of the mortgage, a sufficient portion of the mortgage proceeds allocated to land in the project analysis. As additional assurance, HUD may also require a surety company bond or bonds.</P>

Such sanctions may include:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Debarment.</E> A person who is debarred is prohibited from future participation in federal programs for a period of time. The specific rules and regulations relating to debarment are found at 2 CFR part 2424.</P>

The specific rules and regulations relating to suspension are found at 2 CFR part 2424.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited Denial of Participation.</E> An LDP generally excludes a person from <PRTPAGE P="450"/>future participation in the federal program under which the cause arose.

                <P>(a) When processing a request for an increase in maximum permissible rents, HUD shall take into consideration reasonably anticipated increases in project operating costs that will occur (1) within 12 months of the date of submission of materials to HUD under § 245.315(a) (profit and loss approach) or (2) within 12 months of the anticipated effective date of the proposed rent increase for submissions under § 245.315(b) (forward-budget approach).</P>

                <P>(2) The material (including tenant comments) required to be submitted to HUD under §§ 245.315 and 245.320 must be submitted to the State or local agency administering the section 236 assistance or rent supplement assistance contracts, rather than to HUD. An equivalent State or local agency form or standard accounting form may be substituted for the Statement of Profit and Loss, Form HUD-92410 required under § 245.315(a)(2), if approved by the local HUD office; and<PRTPAGE P="453"/>
                </P>

HUD shall review the agency's determination and certification and, within 30 days, of their submission to HUD, notify the agency of its approval, adjustment upward or downward, or disapproval of the proposed rent increase. HUD will not unreasonably withhold approval of a rent increase approved by the State or local agency.</P>
                <P>(c) If the agency determines to disapprove the request, there is no HUD review of the agency's determination.</P>

                <P>The requirements of this subpart apply to any request by a mortgagor, as provided by § 245.10, for HUD approval of one or more of the following covered actions:</P>
                <P>(a) Conversion of a project from project-paid utilities to tenant-paid utilities, or a reduction in tenant utility allowances.</P>
                <P>(b) Conversion of residential units in a multifamily housing project to a nonresidential use or to condominiums, or the transfer of the project to a cooperative housing mortgagor corporation or association. Conversion of a project to a cooperative or of a portion of a project to nonresidential use does not constitute a change of use requiring mortgagee approval.</P>
                <P>(c) A partial release of mortgage security. The requirements of this subpart, however, do not apply to any release of property from a mortgage lien with respect to a utility easement or a public taking of such property by condemnation or eminent domain.</P>
                <P>(d) Making major capital additions to the project. For the purposes of this subpart, the term “major capital additions” includes only those capital improvements that represent a substantial addition to the project. Upgrading or replacing existing capital components of the project does not constitute a major capital addition to the project.</P>

In the case of a proposed reduction in tenant-paid utilities, the notice must also state that HUD may adjust the proposed reduction upward or downward;</P>
                <P>(e) In the case of a proposed conversion of residential units, partial release of mortgage security, or major capital additions to the project, the proposed action may require the owner to request HUD approval of a rent increase; and</P>

                <P>(a) The regulation of rents for a project coming within the scope of “Subpart B—Unsubsidized Insured Projects” is preempted under these regulations only when the Department determines that the delay or decision of the local rent control board, or other authority regulating rents pursuant to state or local law (hereinafter referred to as board) jeopardizes the Department's economic interest in a project covered by that subpart. The regulation of rents for projects coming within the scope of “Subpart C—Subsidized Insured Projects” is preempted in its entirety by the promulgation of these regulations. The regulation of rents for projects coming within the scope of “Subpart D—HUD-Owned Projects” rests within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department.</P>
                <P>(b) Any state or local law, ordinance, or regulation is without force and effect insofar as it purports to regulate rents of: (1) Projects for which a determination of preemption has been made pursuant to subpart B, or (2) projects coming within the scope of subpart C or D. Compliance with such law, ordinance, or regulation shall not be required as a condition of, or prerequisite to, the remedy of eviction, and any law, ordinance, or regulation which purports to require such compliance is similarly without force and effect.</P>
                <P>(c) It is the purpose of the Department that these regulations shall bar all actions of a board that would in any way frustrate the purpose or effect of these regulations or that would in any way delay, prevent or interfere with the implementation of any increase in rental charges approved by HUD.</P>
                <P>(d) These regulations may be offered as a defense to a proceeding by whomever initiated, which may be brought or threatened to be brought against any owner, mortgagor or managing agent of a project subject to these regulations who demands, receives or retains, or seeks to demand, receive or retain, rental charges approved by HUD, or as a basis for declaratory, injunctive or other relief against any person or agency, public or private, who attempts to enforce, or threatens to enforce, any state or local law, ordinance, or regulation which is without force and effect by reason of this regulation.</P>

                <P>The Department will generally not interfere in the regulation of rents by a rent control board or agency constituted under State or local laws (hereinafter referred to as board) for unsubsidized projects with mortgages insured or held by HUD. However, HUD will preempt the regulation of rents, together with any board regulations which require the mortgagor to offer a lease for a term in excess of one year, under certain conditions. This preemption may occur for such a project when the Department determines that the delay or decision of a board prevents the mortgagor from achieving a level of residential income necessary to maintain and operate adequately the project, which includes sufficient funds to meet the financial obligations under the mortgage.”</P>

The inspection and comment period will be extended as necessary to (a) assure a 30-day comment period on a complete mortgagor's submission and (b) to allow at least 5 days to comment on any written decision made by the board, if the decision is received by the mortgagor on or before the expiration of the thirty-day period and it was not available to the tenants during the first 25 days of the 30-day period. These comments will be transmitted to HUD, along with our evaluation of them and our preemption request. You may also send a copy of your comments directly to HUD at the following address: United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, (address of local HUD field office with jurisdiction over preemption of rents for the project) Attention: Director, Housing Re: (Project No.) and (Name of Apartment Complex).

                <P>The Department finds that it is necessary and desirable to minimize defaults by the mortgagor in its financial obligations with regard to projects covered by this subpart, and to assist mortgagors to preserve the continued viability of those projects as a housing resource for low-income families. The Department also finds that it is necessary and desirable to protect the substantial economic interest of the Federal Government in those projects. Therefore, the Department concludes that it is in the national interest to preempt, and it does hereby preempt, the entire field of rent regulation by local rent control boards, (hereinafter referred to as board), or other authority, acting pursuant to state or local law as it affects projects covered by this subpart.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Manner of service.</E> The notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be accomplished by: (1) Sending a letter by first class mail, properly stamped and addressed, to the tenant at his or her address at the project, with a proper return address, and (2) serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the door at the leased dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the notice under or through the door, if possible, or else by affixing the notice to the door. Service shall not be deemed effective until both notices provided for herein have been accomplished. The date on which the notice shall be deemed to be received by the tenant shall be the date on which the first class letter provided for in this paragraph is mailed, or the date on which the notice provided for in this paragraph is properly given, whichever is later.</P>

Where the termination notice is based on material noncompliance with the rental agreement or material failure to carry out obligations under a state landlord and tenant act pursuant to § 247.3(a)(1) or (2), the time of service shall be in accord with the rental agreement and state law.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Modification of rental agreement.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the landlord may with the prior approval of HUD modify the terms and conditions of the rental agreement, effective at the end of the initial term or a successive term, by serving an appropriate notice on the tenant, together with the tender of a revised rental agreement or an addendum revising the existing rental agreement: Any increase in rent shall in all cases be governed by 24 CFR parts 245, 246 and other applicable HUD regulations. This notice and tender shall be served on the tenant in the same manner as provided for in § 247.4(b) and must be received by the tenant at least 30 days prior to the last date on which the tenant has the right to terminate the tenancy without being bound by the codified terms and conditions. The tenant may accept the modified terms and conditions by executing the tendered revised rental agreement or addendum, or may reject the modified terms and conditions by giving the landlord written notice in accordance with the rental agreement that he intends to terminate the tenancy.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Specificity of notice in rent nonpayment cases.</E> In any case in which a tenancy is terminated because of the tenant's failure to pay rent, a notice stating the dollar amount of the balance due on the rent account and the date of such computation shall satisfy the requirement of specificity set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure of tenant to object.</E> The failure of the tenant to object to the termination notice shall not constitute a <PRTPAGE P="466"/>waiver of his rights to thereafter contest the landlord's action in any judicial proceeding.</P>

                <P>(b) Minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing;</P>
                <P>(c) Work in partnership with State and local government and the private sector in the provision and operation of housing that is affordable to very low, low and moderate income families; and</P>

                <P>The requirements of subparts B and C of this part apply to any project that is eligible low income housing, as defined <PRTPAGE P="468"/>in subparts B and C of this part respectively, on or after November 1, 1987, except that such requirements shall not apply to a project which receives assistance under title IV, subtitle B of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act in connection with a homeownership program approved by the Commissioner thereunder.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Election to proceed under subpart B or subpart C of this part.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Any owner who has not submitted a notice of intent prior to January 1, 1991, pursuant to either § 248.211 or § 248.105, shall proceed under subpart B of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) Any owner who has filed a plan of action with the Commissioner on or before October 11, 1990 pursuant to subpart C of this part, regardless of whether or not the Commissioner has approved such plan of action or whether the owner has received incentives thereunder, may proceed under subpart B of this part by submitting a notice of intent to the Commissioner in accordance with § 248.105 within 30 days after publication of revised Appraisal Guidelines or within thirty days after the Commissioner notifies the owner of HUD's final approval of the plan of action, whichever is later. The notice of intent shall state that the owner is exercising its conversion right pursuant to this section. If the owner fails to file a notice of intent within that period, the owner forfeits its right of conversion. In awarding incentives to an owner who elects to proceed under subpart B of this part in accordance with this section, the Commissioner shall take into consideration any incentives which the owner has already received under subpart C of this part.</P>
                <P>(c) Any owner of housing that becomes eligible low income housing, as defined in subpart B of this part, before January 1, 1991, and who before such date, filed a notice of intent under § 248.211 of subpart C of this part, may, unless a plan of action was submitted after October 11, 1990, elect to proceed under subpart B or under subpart C of this part. An owner must indicate its election by submitting to the Commissioner, within 30 days of the effective date of this part, a notice of election to proceed indicating whether it wishes to proceed under subpart B or subpart C of this part, or proceed under subpart B of this part until completion of the appraisals and then elect either subpart B or subpart C of this part. An owner who chooses to retain its option until after the completion of the appraisals under § 248.111 must submit a new notice of intent to the Commissioner within 30 days after receipt of the information provided by the Commissioner under § 248.131. The notice of intent shall be submitted in accordance with either § 248.105 (for owners electing to proceed under subpart B of this part) or § 248.211 (for owners electing to proceed under subpart C of this part). Any owner who fails to file a notice of intent within the 30-day period may not proceed under subpart C of this part, but may proceed under subpart B of this part by filing a new notice of intent thereafter. If an owner who has filed a notice of intent before January 1, 1991 elects under this paragraph to proceed under subpart C of this part, it may change its election within 30 days after receipt of the information provided by the Commissioner under § 248.131 by filing a new notice of intent under § 248.211. For purposes of calculating any time periods or deadlines under this part for actions following the filing of the notice of intent, the date on which the owner submits the new notice of intent under this paragraph shall be deemed the date of the filing of the notice of intent. Any owner who, exercising its option under paragraph (c) of this section, submits a notice of intent under § 248.211 after the Commissioner has incurred the cost of having an appraisal, or appraisals, performed pursuant to § 248.111 of subpart A of this part, shall reimburse the Commissioner for these expenses within 30 days of receipt of a bill covering these expenses.</P>
                <P>(d) For an owner who has elected under paragraph (c) of this section to proceed under subpart C of this part, the Commissioner shall provide sufficient assistance to enable a nonprofit organization that has purchased, or will purchase, eligible low income housing to meet project oversight costs, as that term is defined in § 248.201.</P>

                <P>(e) The Commissioner shall not refuse to offer incentives under § 248.231 <PRTPAGE P="469"/>to any owner who filed a notice of intent under § 248.211 before October 15, 1991, based solely on the date of filing of the plan action.</P>
                <P>(f) An owner who has filed a plan of action after October 11, 1990, pursuant to § 248.213, may not elect to proceed under subpart B of this part.</P>

                <P>(2) Continued in default or fell into default on or after November 28, 1990, while the mortgage was held by the Commissioner;</P>
                <P>(3) Fell into default prior to November 28, 1990, if the owner entered into a workout agreement prior to that date, and on or after that date, the owner has defaulted under the workout agreement (and, if the agreement was with an insured mortgagee, the mortgage has been assigned to the Commissioner as a result of the default under the workout agreement); or</P>
                <P>(4) Fell into default prior to November 28, 1990, but has been current since that date and the owner has not agreed to recompense the appropriate insurance fund for losses sustained by the fund as a result of any work-out or other arrangement agreed to by the Commissioner and the owner with respect to the defaulted mortgage.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Filing with the Commissioner.</E> The notice of intent shall be filed with the HUD Field Office in whose jurisdiction the project is located. The notice of intent shall identify the project by name, project number and location. It shall contain a statement indicating whether the owner intends to extend the affordability restrictions on the project by retaining ownership of the project or transferring it to a qualified purchaser, or whether the owner intends to terminate the affordability restrictions on the project through prepayment of the mortgage or termination of the mortgage insurance contract. The notice of intent shall also request the tenants to notify the owner, the Commissioner, and the State or local officer identified in the notice of intent of any individual or organization that has been designated or retained by the tenants to represent the tenants with respect to the actions to be taken under subpart B of this part.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice.</E> Within 30 days after the filing of a notice of intent to extend the income restrictions or to transfer the project, the Commissioner shall provide the owner with written notice of—</P>
                <P>(1) The need for, and the rules and guidelines governing, an appraisal of the project;</P>
                <P>(2) The filing deadline for submission of the appraisal;</P>
                <P>(3) The need for an appraiser retained by the Commissioner to inspect the project and the project's financial records; and</P>
                <P>(4) Any delegation to an appropriate State agency, if any, by the Commissioner of responsibilities regarding the performance of an appraisal pursuant to this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisers.</E> The Commissioner and the owner shall each select and compensate an appraiser who shall:</P>
                <P>(1) Neither be an employee of the Federal Government nor an employee or officer of any entity that is affiliated with the owner or the mortgagee of record;</P>
                <P>(2) Be certified by the appropriate State agency under the standards established by the Federal Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 1451-1459); and</P>
                <P>(3) Have six years of experience in the appraisal profession and at least three years experience in the practice of appraising multifamily residential properties;</P>
                <P>(4) Is not the subject of a charge issued following a reasonable cause determination under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Guidelines.</E> The Commissioner shall provide to the owner and the appraiser retained by the Commissioner guidelines for conducting the appraisal. The guidelines established by the Commissioner shall be consistent with customary appraisal standards. The guidelines shall assume repayment of the existing federally-assisted mortgage(s), termination of the existing Federal low income affordability restrictions, simultaneous termination of any Federal rental assistance, and costs of compliance with any State or local laws of general applicability. The guidelines may permit reliance upon assessments of rehabilitation needs and other conversion costs determined by an appropriate State agency, as determined by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Operating expenses.</E> For the purpose of determining preservation values, the guidelines shall instruct the appraiser to use the greater of actual project operating expenses at the time of the appraisal, based on the average of the actual project operating expenses during the preceding three years, or projected operating expenses after conversion, as determined by the Commissioner. However, if the current year operating expenses are higher than those of the preceding three years and the Commissioner has made a determination that these costs are unlikely to decrease in the future, the appraiser shall use current year operating expenses rather than operating expenses for the preceding three years for purposes of comparison with projected operating expenses after conversion. Likewise, if the current year operating expenses are lower than those of the preceding years and the Commissioner has made a determination that these costs are unlikely to increase in the future, the appraiser shall use current year operating expenses rather than operating expenses for the preceding three years for purposes of comparison with projected expenses after conversion. Where the highest and best use of a project is not as rental housing, the appraiser shall use projected operating expenses assuming conversion of the project to its highest and best use.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Preservation values.</E> The preservation values will be determined on the basis of the appraisals conducted by the owner's and the Commissioner's independent appraisers. Each appraiser will determine both the extension preservation value and the transfer preservation value, regardless of the owner's intentions as indicated in the notice of intent.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Highest and best use as residential property.</E> In determining the extension preservation value of the project, the appraiser shall assume conversion of the project to market-rate rental housing. The appraiser shall, in accordance with the guidelines established by the Commissioner, determine the amount <PRTPAGE P="477"/>of rehabilitation expenditures, if any, that would be necessary to bring the project up to quality standards required to attract and sustain a market-rate tenancy upon conversion and assess other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to market-rate multifamily rental housing.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Highest and best use.</E> In determining the transfer preservation value for the project, the appraiser shall assume conversion of the project to highest and best use for the property, and shall, in accordance with the guidelines established by the Commissioner, determine the amount of any rehabilitation expenditures, including demolition, that would be necessary to convert the project to such use and assess other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to its highest and best use.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Submission of appraisal.</E> Within four months after the filing of the notice of intent:</P>
                <P>(1) The owner shall submit to the HUD Field Office in whose jurisdiction the project is located, the appraisal made by the owner's selected appraiser; and</P>
                <P>(2) The Commissioner's selected appraiser shall conduct and submit an appraisal to the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Joint determination of preservation values.</E> No later than one month after the owner and the Commissioner exchange appraisals, the owner and the Commissioner shall, on the basis of the appraisals delivered to them, agree on the preservation values of the project. If no agreement as to preservation values can be reached, the owner and the Commissioner shall jointly select a third appraiser meeting the qualifications set forth in paragraph (c) of this section by the end of six months from the date that the notice of intent was filed. The cost of this third appraisal shall be borne equally by both parties. The third appraiser must comply with the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and must conduct the appraisal and submit an appraisal within two months after accepting the assignment. The determination by the third appraiser of the project's preservation values shall be binding on both the owner and the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Timeliness of appraisals.</E> The Commissioner may approve a plan of action to receive incentives under §§ 248.153, 248.157 or 248.161 only based upon an appraisal conducted in accordance with this section that is not more than 30 months old, unless the failure of the Commissioner to approve the plan of action within the 30-month period was due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> For each eligible low income housing project appraised under § 248.111, the Commissioner shall determine whether the aggregate preservation rents for the project exceed the amount determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units in the project, according to appropriate unit sizes, by 120 percent of the section 8 existing fair market rent for the appropriate unit sizes.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Relevant local markets.</E> If either the extension or transfer preservation rent for a project exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner shall determine whether such extension or transfer preservation rent exceeds the amount determined by multiplying the number of units in the project, according to the appropriate unit sizes, by 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the local market area. The relevant local market, and the prevailing rents in such relevant local market, shall be determined on the basis of the appraisal conducted by the appraiser selected by the Commissioner pursuant to § 248.111 and any other information that the Commissioner determines is appropriate. If there are no comparables in the relevant local market and it is not otherwise possible to determine prevailing rents in that area, the section 8 existing fair market rent shall be the sole measure for determining the Federal cost limit.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Criteria for approval of a plan of action involving prepayment and voluntary termination.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval.</E> The Commissioner may approve a plan of action that provides for the termination of the low income affordability restrictions through prepayment of the mortgage or voluntary termination of the mortgage insurance <PRTPAGE P="482"/>contract only upon a written finding that—</P>
                <P>(1) Implementation of the plan of action will not—</P>
                <P>(i) Materially increase economic hardship for current tenants, and will not in any event result in a monthly rental payment by any current tenant that exceeds 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the tenant or an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds 10 percent (whichever is lower); or in the case of a current tenant who already pays more than such percentage, an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds the increase in the Consumer Price Index or 10 percent (whichever is lower); or</P>
                <P>(ii) Involuntarily displace current tenants (except for good cause) where comparable and affordable housing is not readily available, determined without regard to the availability of Federal housing assistance that would address any such hardship or involuntary displacement; and</P>
                <P>(2) The supply of vacant, comparable housing is sufficient to ensure that such prepayment will not materially affect—</P>
                <P>(i) The availability of decent, safe, and sanitary housing affordable to low income and very low income families or persons in the area that the housing could reasonably be expected to serve;</P>
                <P>(ii) The ability of low income and very low income families or persons to find affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing near employment opportunities; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The housing opportunities of minorities in the community within which the housing is located.</P>
                <P>(3) There are no open audit findings, open findings of noncompliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Executive Order 11063 (3 CFR 1959-1963 comp., p. 652); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); and all regulations promulgated under such statutes and authorities (including, but not limited to 24 CFR part 100), or outstanding violations of the regulatory agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) For purposes of approving a plan of action under this section, the Commissioner shall find that the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section have been met if the owner agrees to execute a use agreement which provides that rents for all tenants residing at the project at the time of plan of action approval will not exceed the limit established in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and that no tenant residing in the project at the time of plan of action approval will be involuntarily displaced without good cause.</P>
                <P>(c) For purposes of approving a plan of action under this section, the Commissioner shall find that the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section have been met if the project is located in a housing market area which has been determined to have an adequate supply of decent, safe and sanitary rental housing; and it has been determined, based on the specific characteristics of the project, that the prepayment would not materially affect the housing opportunities of low and very-low income families.</P>
                <P>(1) For purposes of this section, a “housing market area” is defined as an area where rental housing units of similar characteristics are in relative competition with each other. If a project is in a non-metropolitan area, the housing market area is the county in which the project is located. If the project is located in a metropolitan area the housing market area is the primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA), or in the case of very large metropolitan areas, the housing market area may be a portion of the PMSA.</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of this section, a housing market area may be determined to have an adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing if the housing market area has a soft rental market. A soft rental market is a housing market area in which the supply of vacant available rental housing significantly exceeds the demand. A soft rental market exists if:</P>

                <P>(i) There is currently a surplus of rental housing such that the current excess supply of vacant available housing, plus units currently under construction, is expected to exceed demand for at lest the next 24 months; or<PRTPAGE P="483"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Within the next 12 months, based on the housing production (units currently under construction or with firm planning commitments), in combination with the current supply of available vacant units, supply is expected to exceed demand for at least 24 months.</P>
                <P>(3) In order to determine whether the housing market area has a soft rental market, the Commissioner shall consider data from the 1990 Decennial Census and the most recent available local data concerning changes in population, households, employment, the housing inventory, residential construction activity, and the current and anticipated supply/demand conditions within the overall rental market, as well as the occupancy and vacancy situation in assisted housing projects in the area, including information on waiting lists and the experience of voucher holders in finding units.</P>
                <P>(4) A determination must also be made on whether the prepayment would materially affect the housing opportunities of low and very-low income families in the area, based on the specific characteristics of the project including unit sizes, the type of tenants, e.g., elderly, handicapped, large families, minorities, the location of the project with respect to its proximity to employment opportunities; and the availability of other assisted housing within the immediate area. The prepayment would be determined to materially affect housing opportunities if:</P>
                <P>(i) The project is needed to assist in preserving low income housing in a neighborhood which is being revitalized;</P>
                <P>(ii) The project represents a rare source or the only source of low-and moderate-income rental housing in the immediate area;</P>
                <P>(iii) There is a shortage of the particular type of rental housing provided by the project such as units suitable for the disabled, single room occupancy, or units for large families;</P>
                <P>(iv) The preservation of the housing would be necessary to avoid adversely affecting the housing opportunities of low and very-low income families to find housing near employment opportunities; or</P>
                <P>(v) The preservation of the housing would be necessary to avoid adversely affecting the housing opportunities of minorities in the community within which the housing is located.</P>
                <P>(d) Once the Commissioner has compiled the necessary data and conducted the analysis under paragraph (c) of this section the Commissioner shall issue a written finding to the owner stating whether the plan of action to terminate the low income affordability restrictions is approved or disapproved. The written finding shall contain a specific determination of whether the market area is a soft rental market and prepayment would materially affect housing opportunities. The written finding shall include:</P>
                <P>(1) A statement as to whether the owner has agreed to execute a use agreement to protect current tenants, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
                <P>(2) A description of the geographic boundaries of the housing market area in which the project is located;</P>
                <P>(3) An analysis of current and anticipated supply/demand conditions in both the overall rental market and the assisted housing inventory; and</P>
                <P>(4) A discussion of whether the prepayment would materially affect the housing opportunities, given the specific characteristics of the project.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Disapproval.</E> If the Commissioner determines a plan of action to prepay a mortgage or terminate an insurance contract fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner shall disapprove the plan and within a reasonable time, shall inform the owner of the reasons for disapproval and suggest alternatives. In the case of disapproval of the plan of action, except for the failure to meet the requirement of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the notice of intent filed under § 248.105 shall be rendered ineffective for the purposes of this subtitle, and the owner, in order to receive incentives, must file a new notice of intent under such section. If the plan of action is disapproved because of an outstanding civil rights or audit finding, the finding must be closed before the Commissioner will approve a plan of action under this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Criteria for approval of a plan of action involving incentives.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval.</E> The Commissioner may approve a plan of action for extension of the low income affordability restrictions on an eligible low income housing project or for transfer of the housing to a qualified purchaser, other than a resident council acquiring the project under a resident homeownership plan, only upon a finding that—</P>
                <P>(1) Due diligence has been given to ensuring that the package of incentives set forth in the plan of action is, for the Federal Government, the least costly alternative that is consistent with the full achievement of the purposes of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(2) The project will be retained as housing affordable for very low, low and moderate income families and persons, as determined under paragraph (a)(8) of this section, for the remaining useful life of the project;</P>
                <P>(3) Throughout the remaining useful life of the project, adequate expenditures will be made for maintenance and operation of the project and the project meets the housing standards established in § 248.147 as determined by inspections conducted by the Commissioner;</P>
                <P>(4) Current tenants will not be involuntarily displaced, except for good cause;</P>
                <P>(5) Any increase in rent contributions for current tenants will be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the fair market rent, whichever is lower. However, the rent contributions of any tenants occupying the project at the time of any increase may not be reduced by reason of this paragraph, except with respect to tenants receiving section 8 assistance in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section;</P>
                <P>(6) Any resulting increase in rents for current tenants (except for increases made necessary by increased operating costs) shall be phased in as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) If such increase is 30 percent or more, the increase shall be phased in equally over a period of not less than three years, with the first increase occurring upon the effective date of the plan of action, and the subsequent two increases occurring annually thereafter;</P>
                <P>(ii) If such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent, it shall be limited to not more than 10 percent per year;</P>
                <P>(7) Section 8 assistance shall be provided, to the extent appropriations are available, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effect on current very low and low income tenants;</P>
                <P>(8) Rents for units becoming available to new tenants shall be at levels approved by the Commissioner, taking into account any incentives provided under subpart B of this part, that will ensure, to the extent practicable, that the units will be available and affordable to the same proportions of very low, low and moderate income families and persons, including families and persons whose incomes are 95 percent or more of area median income, as based on the area median income limits established by the Commissioner in February 1987, as resided in the project as of the date of the tenant income profile submitted under § 248.135(e)(5), or the date the plan of action is approved, whichever date results in the highest proportion of very low income families. This limitation shall not prohibit a higher proportion of very low income families and persons from occupying the project;</P>
                <P>(9) Future rent adjustments shall be—</P>
                <P>(i) Made by applying an annual factor, to be determined by the Commissioner, to the portion of rent attributable to operating expenses for the project, and, where the owner is a priority purchaser, to the portion of rent attributable to project oversight costs, as that term is defined in § 248.101; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Subject to a procedure, established by the Commissioner, for owners to apply for rent increases not adequately compensated by annual adjustment under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, under which the Commissioner may increase rents in excess of the amount determined under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section only if the Commissioner determines such increases are necessary to reflect extraordinary necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the project;</P>

                <P>(10) Any savings from reductions in operating expenses due to management efficiencies shall be deposited in <PRTPAGE P="485"/>project reserves for replacement and the owner shall have periodic access to such reserves, to the extent the Commissioner determines that the level of the reserves is adequate and that the project is maintained in accordance with the standards established in § 248.147;</P>
                <P>(11) The mortgage on the project is current; and</P>
                <P>(12) There are no open audit findings, open findings of noncompliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Executive Order 11063 (3 CFR 1959-1963 comp., p. 652); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); and all regulations promulgated under such statutes and authorities (including, but not limited to, 24 CFR part 100), or outstanding violations of the regulatory agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance with housing standards.</E> No incentives under § 248.153 may be provided, other than to qualified purchasers under §§ 248.157 and 245.161, and no distributions may be taken by the owner or purchaser, until the Commissioner determines that the project meets the housing standards set forth in § 248.147, except that incentives designed to correct deficiencies in the project may be provided.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Implementation.</E> Any agreement to maintain the low income affordability restrictions for the remaining useful life of the project may be made through execution of a new regulatory agreement, modifications to the existing regulatory agreement or mortgage, or in the case of prepayment of a mortgage or voluntary termination of mortgage insurance, a recorded instrument.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of remaining useful life.</E> The Commissioner shall make determinations, on the record and after opportunity for a hearing, as to when the useful life of an eligible low income housing project has expired. Under procedures and standards to be established by the Commissioner, owners of eligible low income housing may petition the Commissioner for a determination that the useful life of such project has expired. Such petition may not be filed before the expiration of the 50-year period beginning upon the approval of a plan of action under subpart B of this part with respect to such project. In making a determination pursuant to a petition under paragraph (d) of this section, the Commissioner shall presume that the useful life of the project has not expired, and the owner shall have the burden of proof in establishing such expiration. The Commissioner may not determine that the useful life of any project has expired if such determination results primarily from failure to make regular and reasonable repairs and replacement, as became necessary. In making a determination regarding the useful life of any project pursuant to a petition submitted under paragraph (d) of this section, the Commissioner shall provide for comment by tenants of the project and interested persons and organizations with respect to the petition. The Commissioner shall also provide the tenants and interested persons and organizations with an opportunity to appeal a determination under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) In the case of any plans of action involving incentives the owner must agree to comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Executive Order 11063 (3 CFR 1959-1963 comp., p. 652); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107); section 504 of the Rehabilitiation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (including the Department's Accessibility Guidelines (24 CFR chapter I, subchapter A, appendix II) and all regulations issued pursuant to these authorities.</P>

At least 30 days prior to the inspection, the Commissioner shall notify any tenant representatives, or if none exist, the Commissioner shall provide the owner with a notice to be posted in each affected building, stating the time and date of the inspection and advising any interested tenants that they may accompany HUD personnel on the inspection and/or submit any comments they may have on the physical condition of the project. The Commissioner shall notify the owner of any deficiencies within 30 days following the inspection. The owner shall have 90 days from the date of such notification to correct any deficiencies cited by the Commissioner and shall promptly notify the Commissioner when such deficiencies have been corrected.

                <P>(1) Directing the mortgagee, with respect to an equity take-out loan provided under part 241 of this chapter, to withhold the disbursement to the owner of any escrowed loan proceeds and requiring that such proceeds be used for repair of the project; and</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Sanctions for continuous noncompliance.</E> If, upon inspection, the Commissioner determines that any eligible low income housing project has failed to comply with the standards established under this section for two consecutive years, the Commissioner may, upon notification to the owner of the noncompliance, take one or more of the following actions;</P>
                <P>(1) Subject to the availability of appropriations, provide assistance, other than project-based assistance attached to the project, under part 982 of this title for any tenant eligible for such assistance who desires to terminate occupancy in the project. For each unit in the project vacated pursuant to the provision of assistance under this paragraph, the Commissioner may, notwithstanding any other law or contract for assistance, cancel the provision of project-based assistance attached to the project for one dwelling unit, if the project is receiving such assistance, or convert the project-based assistance allocation for that unit to assistance under part 982 of this title;</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of projects for which an equity take-out loan has been made under part 241 of this chapter, direct the mortgagee to declare such a loan to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan;</P>
                <P>(3) Declare, or direct the insured mortgagee to declare, any rehabilitation loan insured or provided by the Commissioner with respect to the project, including loans provided under part 219 of this chapter, to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan; and</P>

If an owner decides to accept the offer at a later date, the purchaser may renew the offer by resubmitting the earnest money deposit, if a deposit had originally been required, within 30 days of notification of the owner's acceptance of the offer.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Submission of offer to HUD.</E> The purchaser shall submit the offer to the Commissioner.

The plan of action shall include any request for assistance from the Commissioner for purposes of transferring the project.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Requirements for plan of action approval.</E> If the qualified purchaser of the project is a resident council seeking to purchase the project under a resident homeownership program, the Commissioner may approve a plan of action only if the resident council's proposed resident homeownership program meets the requirements under § 248.173 or § 248.175. For all other qualified purchasers, the Commissioner may approve a plan of action submitted pursuant to this section only if the plan of action meets the criteria listed in § 248.145.</P>

                <P>(i) Immediately notify the Commissioner that the sale has fallen through;</P>
                <P>(ii) Notify any other purchaser that had submitted an offer to purchase the project; and</P>

                <P>(2) If the owner accepts an offer from a purchaser, and during the 3-month period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or thereafter, the sales transaction either falls through or does not close within 90 days after the Commissioner's approval of the plan of action, the owner shall take the following steps:</P>
                <P>(i) Immediately notify the Commissioner that the sale has fallen through;</P>
                <P>(ii) Contact any other purchaser that had submitted an offer to purchase the project and give such purchaser and any other qualified purchaser 60 days from the date of notification to the Commissioner in which to resubmit an offer to purchase the project.</P>
                <P>(3) At any time during the 60-day period the owner may accept an offer submitted under paragraph (l)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) If an offer submitted during the 60-day period specified in paragraph (l)(2) of this section is made and accepted, but the sale is not consummated within 90 days of the Commissioner's approval of the plan of action for reasons not attributable in whole or in part to the owner, the owner may terminate the low-income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination, subject to compliance with the provisions of § 248.165.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Assistance.</E> Subject to the availability of amounts approved in appropriation acts, the Commissioner shall, for approvable plans of action, provide assistance sufficient to enable qualified purchasers to:</P>

                <P>(p) <E T="03">Reimbursement of assistance.</E> The Commissioner reserves the right to seek reimbursement from a priority <PRTPAGE P="492"/>purchaser who, within ten years of approval of a plan of action, becomes affiliated with or transfers the project to any non-priority purchaser. The Commissioner shall be entitled to receive reimbursement for the difference between the assistance provided to the priority purchaser and the assistance that would have been provided in the same circumstances to a non-priority purchaser.</P>
                <P>(q) <E T="03">Seller financing.</E> In order to finance the acquisition or rehabilitation of a project under this section, a qualified purchaser may receive take-back financing from the owner of the project. If the purpose of the seller financing is to aid acquisition of the project, the principal amount of such financing, together with an acquisition loan provided under part 241 of this chapter, may not exceed the transfer preservation equity of the project, plus, in the case of priority purchasers, any expenses associated with the acquisition, loan closing, and implementation of the plan of action. If the purpose of the seller financing is to fund rehabilitation of the project, the principal amount of such financing may not exceed the equity requirements for a rehabilitation loan under § 241.70 or § 219.305 of this chapter. The seller may not charge interest on any seller financing at a rate in excess of that of the Federal acquisition or rehabilitation loan.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification of Commissioner.</E> The owner of any eligible low income housing project who prepays the mortgage or voluntarily terminates the mortgage insurance contract pursuant to subpart B of this part, shall notify the Commissioner of:</P>
                <P>(1) The names and addresses of all of the tenants in the project who will be displaced;</P>
                <P>(2) The size of the unit in which each of the displaced tenants is currently dwelling; and</P>
                <P>(3) The names of all of the displaced tenants who are special needs tenants, as that term is defined in § 248.101, as well as a statement as to the nature of their special need.</P>
                <P>The owner shall provide the Commissioner with this information within 30 days of identifying such tenants for displacement, but in no event less than 30 days prior to the date when the tenants must vacate the premises.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation of displaced tenants.</E> The Commissioner shall coordinate with public housing agencies to ensure that any very low or low income family displaced from eligible low income housing as the result of prepayment of the mortgage or termination of the mortgage insurance contract on such project is able to acquire a suitable, affordable dwelling unit in the area where the project from which the displaced family is located. The Commissioner, upon receiving information from the owner under paragraph (b) of this section stating that certain tenants will be displaced, shall request from the public housing agencies located in the same area as the affected project, notices of vacancies in other affordable projects which would be suitable for the displaced tenants. The Commissioner shall convey the notices of vacancies to the tenants who will be displaced along with the addresses of the local public housing agencies.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Relocation expenses.</E> The Commissioner shall require the owner of eligible low income housing who prepays or terminates the insurance contract resulting in the displacement of tenants to pay 50 percent of the relocation expenses of each family which is relocated, except that the Commissioner shall increase such percentage to the extent that State or local law of general applicability requires a higher payment by the owner.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Continued occupancy.</E> Each owner who prepays the mortgage or terminates the mortgage insurance contract on eligible low income housing shall, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, allow the tenants occupying units in such project on the date of submission of a notice of intent under § 248.105 to remain in the project for a period of three years, commencing on the date of prepayment or contract termination, at rent levels existing at the time of prepayment or termination, except for rent increases made necessary due to increased operating costs.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Replacement unit.</E> In any case in which the Commissioner requires an owner to allow tenants to occupy units under paragraph (e) of this section, an owner may fulfill the requirements of such paragraph by providing such assistance necessary for the tenant to rent a decent, safe, and sanitary unit in another project for the same 3-year period and at a rental cost to the tenant not in excess of the rental amount the tenant would have been required to pay to the owner in the owner's project, except that the tenant must freely agree to waive the right to occupy the unit in the owner's project. The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section requiring an owner who prepays or terminates an insurance contract to pay a portion of the relocation expenses incurred by displaced tenants shall also be applicable to tenants who relocate pursuant to this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section shall apply only to:</P>

                <P>(1) All tenants in eligible low income housing projects located in a low-vacancy area; and<PRTPAGE P="494"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Special needs tenants.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Low Vacancy Areas.</E> The Commissioner shall notify the owner, within 30 days of the owner's request to prepay under § 248.169, whether the project is located in a low vacancy area for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Required acceptance of section 8 assistance.</E> Any owner who prepays the mortgage or terminates the mortgage insurance contract on eligible low income housing and maintains the project for residential rental occupancy may not refuse to rent, refuse to negotiate for the rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the rental of a dwelling unit in such project to any person, or discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges or rental of a unit, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because the person receives tenant-based assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Regional pools.</E> In providing assistance under this section, the Commissioner shall allocate the assistance on a regional basis through the regional offices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Commissioner shall allocate assistance under this section in a manner so that the total number of assisted units in each such region available for occupancy by, and affordable to, low income families and persons does not decrease because of the prepayment of a mortgage on eligible low income housing or the termination of an insurance contract on such project.</P>
                <P>(k) This section shall only apply to prepayments and terminations occurring pursuant to §§ 248.157(l) and 248.169.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Notwithstanding any limitations on prepayment or voluntary termination under subpart B of this part, an owner may terminate the low income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination, subject to compliance with the provisions of § 248.165, under one of the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) The Commissioner approves a plan of action under § 248.153(a), but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan and contained in an executed use agreement between the Commissioner and the owner, including section 8 assistance or a loan provided under part 219 of this chapter, but not including insurance of a rehabilitation or equity take-out loan under part 241 of this chapter, during the 15-month period beginning on the date of final approval of the plan of action;</P>
                <P>(2) After the date that the project would have been eligible for prepayment pursuant to the terms of the mortgage, notwithstanding this part, the Commissioner approves a plan of action under § 248.157 or § 248.161, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan, including section 8 assistance, a loan provided under part 219 of this chapter, a grant provided under § 248.157(o), or a grant under § 248.161(d), before the earlier of:</P>
                <P>(i) The expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the first fiscal year beginning after such final approval; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The expiration of the 6-month period beginning on the date of final approval.</P>
                <P>(3) The Commissioner approves a plan of action under §§ 248.157 or 248.161 for any eligible low income housing not covered by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of:</P>
                <P>(i) The expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the first fiscal year beginning after such final approval; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of final approval.</P>
                <P>(4) An owner who intended to transfer the project to a qualified purchaser under § 248.157 or § 248.161, and fully complied with the provisions of such section,</P>
                <P>(i) Did not receive any bona fide offers from any qualified purchasers within the applicable time periods; or</P>

                <P>(ii) Received and accepted a bona fide offer from a qualified purchaser, but the sales transaction fell through for reasons not attributable in whole or in part to the owner, and the owner then <PRTPAGE P="495"/>complied with the requirements of § 248.157(l) and did not receive another bona fide offer from any qualified purchasers.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Section 8 assistance.</E> When providing section 8 assistance, the Commissioner may enter into a contract with an owner, contingent upon the future availability of appropriations, for the purpose of renewing expiring contracts for rental assistance as provided in appropriations acts, to extend the term of such rental assistance for such additional period or periods necessary to carry out an approved plan of action. The contract and approved plan of action shall provide that, if the Commissioner is unable to extend the term of such rental assistance or is unable to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits to the owner comparable to those received under the original approved plan of action, the Commissioner, upon the request of the owner, shall take the following actions, subject to the limitations under the following paragraphs:</P>
                <P>(1) Modify the binding commitments made pursuant to § 248.145(a)(2)-(10) that are dependent upon such rental assistance; or</P>
                <P>(2) If the Commissioner determines that such modification is infeasible, permit the owner to prepay the mortgage and terminate the plan of action and any implementing use agreements or restrictions, but only if the owner agrees in writing to comply with the provisions of § 248.165.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to provide section 8 assistance.</E> With regard to paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall notify the owner of an inability to either extend the term of section 8 rental assistance or to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits comparable to those received under the original plan of action as soon as practicable upon discovering that fact. The owner shall inform the Commissioner in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice that, since the Commissioner is unable to fulfill the terms of the original plan of action, the owner intends to request that the Commissioner take action under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section. The Commissioner shall, no later than 90 days from receiving the owner's notice, take action to extend the rental assistance contract and to continue the binding commitments under § 248.145(a)(2)-(10).</P>

                <P>(g) <E T="03">Required conditions.</E> The Commissioner shall require that the form of homeownership impose appropriate conditions, including conditions to assure that:</P>
                <P>(1) To the extent practicable, the number of initial owners that are very low, low, and moderate income persons at initial occupancy are of the same proportion of very low, low, and moderate income tenants (including families and persons whose incomes are 95 percent or more of area median income) as resided in the project on January 1, 1987 (or if the January 1, 1987 profile is unavailable, a certification from the owner stating its unavailability and a profile as of January 1, 1988, or, if that is also unavailable, a profile as of January 1, 1989) or as of the date of approval of the plan of action, whichever date results in the higher proportion of very low income families, except that the resident council may, at its option, increase the proportions of very low income and low income initial owners, however, no current tenant may be denied homeownership as a result of this paragraph;</P>
                <P>(2) Projected debt service payments, occupancy charges and utilities payable by the owners shall not exceed 35 percent of the monthly adjusted gross income of the owners;</P>
                <P>(3) The aggregate incomes of initial owners and other sources of funds for the project are sufficient to permit occupancy charges to cover the full operating costs of the project and any debt service; and</P>
                <P>(4) Each initial owner occupies the unit it acquires for at least the initial 15 years of ownership, unless the resident council determines that the initial owner is required to move outside the market area due to a change in employment or an emergency situation.</P>
                <P>(5) All units which remain as rental units, from the date of approval of the resident homeownership program, until they are purchased by an initial owner under the resident homeownership program, shall be maintained in accordance with § 248.145 (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(9).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Use of proceeds from sales to eligible families.</E> The entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families, or another entity specified in the approved application, may use 50 percent of the proceeds, if any, from the initial sale for costs of the homeownership program, including improvements to <PRTPAGE P="498"/>the project, operating and replacement reserves for the project, additional homeownership opportunities in the project, and other project-related activities approved by the Commissioner. The remaining 50 percent of such proceeds shall be returned to the Commissioner for use under §§ 248.157 and 248.161, subject to the availability of appropriations. Such entity shall keep, and make available to the Commissioner, all records necessary to calculate accurately payments due the Commissioner under paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Restrictions on resale by homeowners.</E> Resale of a homeowner's interest in a project with an approved homeownership program may occur subject to any reasonable restrictions placed on such a transfer by the resident council and approved by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Transfer permitted.</E> A homeowner may transfer the homeowner's ownership interest in the unit, subject to the right to purchase under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the requirement for the purchaser to execute a promissory note, if required under paragraph (i)(3) of this section and the restrictions on retention of sales proceeds in paragraph (k) of this section. An applicant may propose in its application, and HUD may approve, reasonable restrictions on the resale of units under the program.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Right to purchase.</E> Where a resident management corporation, resident council, or cooperative has jurisdiction over the unit, it shall have the right to purchase the ownership interest in the unit from the initial homeowner for the amount specified in a firm contract between the homeowner and a prospective buyer. Where a resident management corporation, resident council, or a cooperative exercises a right to purchase, it shall resell the unit to an eligible family within a reasonable period of time.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Promissory note required.</E> At closing, the initial homeowner shall execute a nonrecourse promissory note for a term of twenty years, in a form acceptable to HUD, equal to the difference between the fair market value of the unit and the purchase price, payable to the Commissioner, together with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note.</P>
                <P>(i) With respect to a sale by an initial homeowner, the note shall require payment upon sale by the initial homeowner, to the extent proceeds of the sale remain after paying off other outstanding debt incurred in connection with the purchase of the property, paying any other amounts due in connection with the sale, including closing costs and transfer taxes, and paying the family the amount of its equity in the property, computed in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) With respect to a sale by an initial homeowner during the first six years after acquisition, the family may retain only the amount computed under paragraph (k) of this section. Any excess is distributed as provided in paragraph (1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) With respect to a sale by an initial homeowner six to twenty years after acquisition, the amount payable under the note shall be reduced by 1/168th of the original principal amount of the note for each full month of ownership by the family after the end of the sixth year. The homeowner may retain all other proceeds of the sale.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Execution of promissory note by subsequent purchaser.</E> Where a subsequent purchaser during the 20-year period, measured by the term of the initial promissory note, purchases the property for less than the then current fair market value, the purchaser shall also execute at closing such a promissory note and mortgage, for the amount of the discount. The term of the promissory note shall be the period remaining of the original 20-year period. The note shall require payment upon sale by the subsequent homeowner, to the extent proceeds of the sale remain after paying off other outstanding debt incurred in connection with the purchase of the property, and paying any other amounts due in connection with the sale (such as closing costs and transfer taxes). The amount payable on the note shall be reduced by a percentage of the original principal amount of the note for each full month of ownership by the subsequent homeowner. The percentage shall be computed by determining the percentage of the term of <PRTPAGE P="499"/>the promissory note that the homeowner has owned the property. The remainder may be retained by the subsequent homeowner selling the property.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Homeowners' equity.</E> The amount of equity an initial homeowner has in the property is determined by computing the sum of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The contribution to equity paid by the family, if any, including any down payment and any amount paid towards principal on a mortgage loan during the period of ownership;</P>
                <P>(2) The value of any improvements installed at the expense of the family during the family's tenure as owner, as determined by the resident council based on evidence of amounts spent on the improvements, including the cost of material and labor; and</P>
                <P>(3) The appreciated value, determined by applying the Consumer Price Index (urban consumers) against the contribution to equity under paragraphs (k) (1) and (2) of this section, excluding the value of any sweat equity or volunteer labor used to make improvements to the unit. The resident council may, at the time of initial sale, enter into an agreement with the family to set a maximum amount which this appreciation may not exceed.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Use of recaptured funds.</E> Any net sales proceeds that may not be retained by the homeowner under the homeownership program approved under this section shall be paid to the HOME Investment Trust Fund for the unit of general local government in which the project is located. If the project is located in a unit of general local government that is not a participating jurisdiction, as such term is defined in § 248.101, any such net sales proceeds shall be paid to the HOME Investment Trust Fund for the State in which the project is located. With respect to any proceeds transferred to a HOME Investment Trust Fund under paragraph (1) of this section, the Commissioner shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the proceeds shall be immediately available for eligible activities to expand the supply of affordable housing under section 212 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12742). The Commissioner shall monitor the HOME Investment Trust Fund for each State and unit of local government and shall require maintenance of any records necessary to calculate accurately payments due under this paragraph (1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Protection of nonpurchasing families.</E> Nonpurchasing families who continue to reside in a project subject to a homeownership program approved under this section shall be protected as follows:</P>

                <P>(a) An owner of eligible low-income housing seeking to prepay its mortgage or to negotiate changes in the terms of the mortgage or regulatory agreement in accordance with this part, including termination of the insurance contract pursuant to section 229 of the National <PRTPAGE P="505"/>Housing Act, shall file a notice of intent with the HUD field office in whose jurisdiction the project is located, and shall file a duplicate copy with the HUD Headquarters Office of Multifamily Housing Management, 451-7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. The notice of intent shall identify the project by name, project number and location, briefly describe the owner's plans for the project, including any timetables or deadlines for actions to be taken, and the reason the owner seeks to prepay the mortgage or change the terms of the mortgage or regulatory agreement, and briefly describe any contacts that the owner has made or is making with other governmental agencies or other interested parties in connection with the notice of intent.</P>
                <P>(b) An owner simultaneously shall file the notice of intent with:</P>
                <P>(1) The chief executive officer of the appropriate State or local government in which the project is located, or any officer designated by executive order or State or local law to receive such information;</P>
                <P>(2) Each tenant in the project; and</P>
                <P>(3) The mortgagee.</P>
                <FP>In addition, the owner shall post a copy of the notice of intent in each occupied building in the project.</FP>
                <P>(c) Upon receipt of a notice of intent, the Commissioner will provide the owner with information that the owner needs to prepare a plan of action. This information shall include information regarding the Commissioner's standards under § 248.221 of this part regarding the approval of a plan of action involving termination of low income affordability restrictions, and any relevant market area and demographic information that the Secretary has custody of and that the owner may use in preparing the plan of action; in addition, it shall include at a minimum a list of the Federal incentives authorized under § 248.231 of this part for those projects for which a plan of action involving termination of low income affordability restrictions would not be approvable.</P>
                <P>(d) Filing a notice of intent with the Commissioner will lead to one of the following results:</P>
                <P>(1) Where the project meets the requirements of § 248.221 of this part—</P>
                <P>(i) The Commissioner will approve the prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance pursuant to § 248.221 of this part, and all low income affordability restrictions will be terminated with respect to some or all of the units; however, the owner would be responsible for ensuring that displaced current tenants are relocated to affordable housing, if necessary.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Commissioner will approve the prepayment or termination of mortgage insurance pursuant to § 248.221 of this part, and all low income affordability restrictions will be terminated, except (where necessary because the project is located in a housing market where there is insufficient comparable, decent, safe and sanitary affordable housing to meet the needs of all current tenants) with regard to protection of current very low income, low income and moderate income tenants;</P>
                <P>(2) Where the plan of action would not be approvable under § 248.221 of this part—</P>
                <P>(i) The Commissioner will approve prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance, but the owner will receive assistance under a State, local or other Federal government housing program, and will receive incentives pursuant to § 248.231 of this part from the Federal government in return for agreeing to conditions related to the continued use of the project as low income housing in accordance with § 248.233 of this part.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Commissioner will not approve prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance, but will provide incentives to the owner pursuant to § 248.231 of this part in accordance with a plan of action meeting the standards of § 248.233 of this part;</P>
                <P>(iii) The Commissioner will not approve prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance, but, after failing to reach agreement on a negotiated plan of action, the owner and the Commissioner will agree to a package of incentives and restrictions prescribed by § 248.241 of this part; or</P>

                <P>(iv) The Commissioner will not approve prepayment or the termination <PRTPAGE P="506"/>of mortgage insurance, and will not offer incentives of any kind.</P>

                <P>The Commissioner may approve a plan of action that involves termination of the low income affordability restrictions only upon a written finding that—</P>
                <P>(a) Implementation of the plan of action will not materially increase economic hardship for current tenants (and will not in any event result in: (1) A monthly rental payment by a current tenant that exceeds 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the tenant or an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds 10 percent, whichever is lower, or (2) in the case of a current tenant who already pays more than such percentage, an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds the increase in the Consumer Price Index or 10 percent, whichever is lower) or involuntarily displace current tenants (except for good cause) where comparable and affordable housing is not readily available, determined without regard to the availability of Federal housing assistance that would address any such hardship or involuntary displacement. Notwithstanding this limitation, the Commissioner may provide housing assistance to tenants if such assistance is not essential to the Commissioner's determination that the requirements of this paragraph have been met. The owner will agree to execute and allow the recordation of use agreements, where such agreements are necessary to safeguard current tenants against such adverse effects. Such use agreements will include a requirement that the owner comply with those provisions of part 247 of this chapter which relate to evictions; and</P>

                <P>(b)(1) The supply of vacant, comparable housing is sufficient to ensure that the prepayment will not materially affect—<PRTPAGE P="508"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing affordable to low-income and very low income families in the area that the housing could reasonably be expected to serve;</P>
                <P>(ii) The ability of low-income and very low income families to find decent, safe and sanitary housing near employment opportunities; or</P>

                <P>(c) There are no open audit findings, open findings of noncompliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Executive Order 11063 (3 CFR 1959-1963 comp., p. 652); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); and all regulations promulgated under such statutes and authorities (including, but not limited to, 24 CFR part 100), or outstanding violations of the regulatory agreement.</P>

                <P>(1) Current tenants will not be involuntarily displaced (except for good cause);</P>
                <P>(2) Housing opportunities for minorities will not be adversely affected in the communities in which the housing is located;</P>
                <P>(3) Any increase in rent for current tenants will be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenants or fair market rent, whichever is lower, and any increase not necessitated by increased operating costs shall be phased in equally over not less than 3 years if the increase exceeds 10 percent;</P>
                <P>(4) Housing approved under the State strategy will remain affordable to very low income, low income and moderate income families for not less than the remaining term of the mortgage, if the housing is to be made available for rental use, or for not less than 40 years, if the housing is to be made available for homeownership;</P>
                <P>(5)(i) Not less than 80 percent of all units in eligible low income housing approved under the State strategy will be retained as affordable to families or persons meeting the income eligibility standards for initial occupancy that applied to housing on January 1, 1987; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Not less than 60 percent of the units in any one project will remain available to and affordable by such families or persons, within which not less than 20 percent of the units will remain available to and affordable by very low income families;</P>
                <P>(6) Expenditures for rehabilitation, maintenance and operation will be at a level necessary to maintain the housing as decent, safe and sanitary and for the period specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section;</P>

                <P>(8) For each unit of eligible low income housing approved under the State strategy that is not retained as affordable housing to families or persons meeting the income eligibility standards for initial occupancy on January 1, 1987, the State will provide, with <PRTPAGE P="509"/>State funds, one additional unit of comparable housing in the same market area that is available to and affordable by such families and persons. Such units will be provided by conversion of existing units or construction of new units. These units or funds will be made available before the Commissioner approves the State strategy.</P>

                <P>(a) After taking into account local market conditions, the incentives are necessary to achieve the purposes of this part;</P>
                <P>(b) The incentives are necessary to provide a fair rate of return to the owner. Incentives will only be provided in cases where the project's current use does not represent its highest and best use;</P>
                <P>(c) The incentives are the least costly alternative for the Federal government to achieve the purposes of this part with respect to the housing;</P>

                <P>(4) Any increase in rent contributions for current tenants will be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the fair market rent, whichever is lower;</P>

                <P>(5) Any resulting increase in rents for current tenants (except for increases made necessary by increased operating costs) will be phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if the increase is 30 percent or more, and will be limited to not more than 10 percent per year, if the increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent;<PRTPAGE P="510"/>

                <P>(7) Rents for units becoming available to new tenants will be at levels approved by the Commissioner that will ensure, to the extent practicable, that the units will be available to and affordable, with 30 percent of adjusted income, by the same proportion of very low income families, low-income families, and moderate income families as resided in the housing as of January 1, 1987 (based on the area median income limits established by the Commissioner in February 1987), or the date the plan of action is approved, whichever date results in the highest proportion of very low income families.</P>

                <P>(A) The percentage of moderate income families in occupancy as of January 1, 1987 shall include families who were admitted to the project as very low income, low income, or moderate income families but whose incomes had increased beyond the limit for moderate income families by January 1, 1987; and</P>
                <P>(B) The proportions established shall not prohibit a higher proportion of very low income families from occupying the housing.</P>
                <P>(ii) In approving rents under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the Commissioner will take into account any additional incentives provided under this part and will make provision for annual rent adjustments necessary as a result of future reasonable increases in operating costs.</P>
                <P>(e) In cases where the owner agrees to maintain only a portion of the project as low income housing, the incentives provided under § 248.231 of this part and the standards imposed under this section shall be adjusted accordingly.</P>
                <P>(f) The Commissioner shall not approve a plan of action under this section if there are open findings of noncompliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Executive Order 11063 (3 CFR 1959-1963 comp., p. 652); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); and all regulations promulgated under such statutes and authorities, or if there are open audit findings with respect to violations of the regulatory agreement.</P>

                <P>(b) The contract and the approved plan of action shall provide that, if the Commissioner is unable to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits to the owner comparable to those received under the original approved plan of action, the Commissioner, upon the request of the owner, shall take the following actions (subject to the limitations under the following paragraphs):</P>
                <P>(1) Modification of the binding commitments made pursuant to § 248.233(d) that are dependent on such rental assistance.</P>

                <P>(3) If actions under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) would, in the determination of the Commissioner, result in the default of the insured loan, approveal of the revised plan of action, notwithstanding § 248.221, that involves the termination of low-income affordability restrictions.</P>

                <P>(c) The approved plan of action shall specify actions that the Commissioner and the owner shall take to ensure that any tenants displaced as a result of actions taken under paragraph (b) of this <PRTPAGE P="511"/>section are relocated to affordable housing.</P>
                <P>(d) At least 30 days prior to making a request under the preceding sentence, an owner shall notify the Commissioner of the owner's intention to submit the request.

              <P>(1) Will honor legally binding and validly issued commitments issued before November 12, 1990 and</P>
              <P>(2) Will accept for review the coinsurance applications described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) A precommitment review procedure applies to any application for mortgage coinsurance for which a lender has accepted a non-refundable application fee before November 12, 1990 under this part and for which a legally binding Conditional or Firm Commitment is proposed to be issued. This procedure applies to lenders with preliminary as well as full approval to process coinsurance applications and without regard to whether the lender is under probation. For any coinsurance application for which the lender has accepted an application and a non-refundable application fee before November 12, 1990, the lender shall, prior to commitment, submit to HUD headquarters and to the HUD field office with jurisdiction for the proposed project such exhibits and other information as has been specified in administrative instructions of the Commissioner. The lender shall not issue a commitment without written approval from the Commissioner. Field Offices shall not endorse any case covered by this precommitment review requirement unless the lender submits with the endorsement package evidence of the Commissioner's approval of the processing and evidence of compliance with any conditions imposed by the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(c) Extensions of commitments for projects which had outstanding legally binding commitments as of November 12, 1990 are limited as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Firm commitments for insurance of advances may be granted two 60-day extensions;</P>
              <P>(2) Conditional commitments may be granted one 60-day extension;</P>
              <P>(3) Firm commitments for insurance upon completion may not be extended.</P>
              <FP>However, should any underwriting conclusions be altered and reflected in the extension, the project must be submitted for precommitment review in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. In the event an extension is required beyond those provided for in this paragraph, the case will be subject to the precommitment review process described in paragraph (b) of this section.</FP>

              <P>(a) For any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the mortgage to itself. However, before exercising this right, GNMA will attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender (unless GNMA determines, with the agreement of the Commissioner, that <PRTPAGE P="518"/>the attempt would prove ineffectual because of market conditions or other factors). This attempt will be undertaken by soliciting offers to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring lenders that are also GNMA issuers and that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(b) For any Coinsured Mortgage that is in default and held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the Coinsured Mortgage directly to itself before extinguishing the Mortgage by completion of foreclosure action or acquisition of title by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.</P>
              <P>(c) GNMA, as assignee, will give the Commissioner written notice, within 30 days after taking a Mortgage by assignment in accordance with this section, in order to allow an appropriate endorsement and necessary changes in the Commissioner's records.</P>
              <P>(d) The Commissioner will endorse any Mortgage assigned to GNMA as provided by this section for full insurance, effective as of the date of assignment in accordance with the appropriate provisions of 24 CFR part 221. Any future claim by GNMA, or any assignment of the fully insured Mortgage, will be governed by the appropriate provisions of 24 CFR part 221, except that any payment will be made in cash instead of debentures.</P>

              <P>(a) Continuing the Mortgage under coinsurance could jeopardize the lender's viability and ability to service its remaining portfolio of coinsured Mortgages;</P>
              <P>(b) The lender has made reasonable efforts to work out any Mortgage default consistent under 24 CFR 251.811 (1990), but the remedies available to the lender have not been adequate to reinstate the Mortgage;</P>

              <P>(e) The lender agrees to give the Commissioner written notice under 24 CFR 207.258 of its intent to file an insurance claim upon the Commissioner's endorsement of the Mortgage for full insurance.</P>

For any coinsurance application for which the lender has accepted an application and a non-refundable application fee before November 12, 1990, the lender shall, prior to commitment, submit to HUD headquarters and to the HUD field office with jurisdiction for the proposed project such exhibits and other information as has been specified in administrative instructions of the Commissioner. The lender shall not issue a commitment without written approval from the Commissioner. Field Offices shall not <PRTPAGE P="521"/>endorse any case covered by this precommitment review requirement unless the lender submits with the endorsement package evidence of the Commissioner's approval of the processing and evidence of compliance with any conditions imposed by the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(c) Extensions of commitments for projects which had outstanding legally binding commitments as of November 12, 1990 are limited as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Conditional commitments may be extended not to exceed 180 days from the date of original issuance;</P>
              <P>(2) Firm commitments may be granted two 60-day extensions.</P>
              <FP>However, should any underwriting conclusions be altered and reflected in the extension, the project must be submitted for precommitment review in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. In the event an extension is required beyond those provided for in this paragraph, the case will be subject to the precommitment review process described in paragraph (b) of this section.</FP>
              <P>(d) Reopened expired commitments are subject to precommitment review under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) HUD considers a commitment to be <E T="03">legally binding</E> if:</P>
              <P>(1) It conforms to the format prescribed in the appropriate HUD Handbook and contains only such modifications as have been approved by HUD in writing;</P>
              <P>(2) All required underwriting, analyses, reviews and approvals have been accomplished prior to issuance of the commitment;</P>
              <P>(3) It conforms to HUD requirements pertaining to initial term and extension;</P>

              <P>(4) It obligates the lender and HUD to proceed to the next stage (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> firm commitment in the case of a conditional commitment, or endorsement in the case of a firm commitment) if the applicant mortgagor complies with all conditions of such commitment;</P>
              <P>(5) It does not permit the lender to change unilaterally the conditions or terms of the commitment; and</P>
              <P>(6) It is signed by an official of the coinsuring lender who has been designated and authorized in accordance with HUD requirements.</P>
              <APPRO>(Information collection requirements in paragraph (b) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0437)</APPRO>

              <SUBJECT>GNMA right to assignment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>If the lender-issuer defaults on its obligations under the GNMA Mortgage-Backed Securities Program, GNMA will have the right to cause all Coinsured Mortgages held in GNMA pools by the defaulting coinsuring lender-issuer to be assigned to another GNMA-approved coinsuring lender-issuer, or to GNMA itself.</P>
              <P>(a) For any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the mortgage to itself. However, before exercising this right, GNMA will attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender (unless GNMA determines, with the agreement of the Commissioner, that the attempt would prove ineffectual because of market conditions or other factors). This attempt will be undertaken by soliciting offers to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring lenders that are also GNMA issuers and that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(b) For any Coinsured Mortgage that is in default and held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the Coinsured Mortgage directly to itself before extinguishing the Mortgage by completion of foreclosure action or acquisition of title by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.</P>
              <P>(c) GNMA, as assignee, will give the Commissioner written notice, within 30 days after taking a Mortgage by assignment in accordance with this section, in order to allow an appropriate endorsement and necessary changes in the Commissioner's records.</P>

              <P>(d) The Commissioner will endorse any Mortgage assigned to GNMA as <PRTPAGE P="522"/>provided by this section for full insurance, effective as of the date of assignment in accordance with the appropriate provisions of 24 CFR part 207. Any future claim by GNMA, or any assignment of the fully insured Mortgage, will be governed by the appropriate provisions of 24 CFR part 207, except that any payment will be made in cash instead of debentures.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and scope.</E> (1) Section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 directs the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, acting through the Federal Housing Administration, to carry out programs that will demonstrate the effectiveness of providing new forms of Federal credit enhancement for multifamily loans. Section 542, entitled, “Multifamily Mortgage Credit Demonstrations,” provides new independent insurance authority that is not under the National Housing Act.</P>
                <P>(2) Section 542(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 specifically directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot program of risk-sharing with qualified State and local housing finance agencies (HFAs). The qualified HFAs are authorized to underwrite and process loans. HUD will provide full mortgage insurance on affordable multifamily housing projects processed by such HFAs under this program. Through risk-sharing agreements with HUD, HFAs contract to reimburse HUD for a portion of the loss from any defaults that occur while HUD insurance is in force.</P>
                <P>(3) The extent to which HUD will direct qualified HFAs regarding their underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions is related to the proportion of the risk taken by an HFA.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The primary purpose of this pilot program is to test the effectiveness of providing new forms of credit enhancement for multifamily loans, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> utilization of full insurance by HUD, pursuant to risk-sharing agreements with qualified housing finance agencies, for the development of affordable housing. The utilization of Federal credit enhancements should increase access to capital markets and, thereby, increase the supply of affordable multifamily housing. By permitting HFAs to underwrite, process, and service loans and to manage and dispose of properties that fall into default, HUD expects affordable housing to be made available to eligible families and individuals in a timely manner.</P>

The units may be detached, semi-detached, row houses, multifamily structures, or mobile home parks (exclusive of the mobile homes).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">New construction or substantial rehabilitation.</E> Insurance under this part shall be for the purpose of financing the new construction or substantial rehabilitation of projects meeting the other requirements of this part as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) If an existing multifamily project is being acquired and HUD insurance under this part will be used to facilitate the acquisition of projects to increase the supply of affordable housing, such acquisitions are permissible if the HUD insured mortgage does not exceed the sum of the total cost of acquisition, cost of financing, cost of repairs, and reasonable transaction costs as determined by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(2) If the property is subject to an HFA-financed loan to be refinanced and such refinancing will result in the preservation of affordable housing, refinancing of these properties is permissible if project occupancy is not less than 93 percent (to include consideration of rent in arrears), based on the average occupancy in the project over the most recent 12 months, and the mortgage does not exceed an amount supportable by the lower of the unit rents being collected under the rental assistance agreement or the unit rents being collected at unassisted projects in the market area that are similar in amenities and location to the project for which insurance is being requested. The HUD-insured mortgage may not exceed the sum of the existing indebtedness, cost of refinancing, the cost of repairs and reasonable transaction costs as determined by the Commissioner. If a loan to be refinanced has been in default within the 12 months prior to application for refinancing, the HFA must assume not less than 50 percent of the risk.</P>

In periodic advances cases, progress payments approved by the HFA and both an initial and final endorsement on the mortgage are required.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Insurance of advances.</E> Periodic advances will be authorized by the HFA subject to terms specified by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Insurance upon completion</E>—(1) <E T="03">New construction and substantial rehabilitation.</E> An HFA may approve a loan that will be insured upon completion of construction of the project. The HFA approval must prescribe a designated period during which the mortgagor must start construction or substantial rehabilitation. If construction or rehabilitation is started as required, the approval will be valid for the period estimated by the HFA for construction and loan closing, including any extension approved by the HFA.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Existing projects with no substantial rehabilitation.</E> Existing projects with or without repairs are only insured upon completion, although HFAs may permit noncritical repairs to be completed after endorsement upon establishment of escrows acceptable to the HFA.<PRTPAGE P="535"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirements applicable to both periodic advances and insurance upon completion cases</E>—(1) <E T="03">Inspections.</E> The HFA must inspect projects under this part at such times during construction, substantial rehabilitation, or repairs as the HFA determines. The inspections must be conducted to assure compliance with plans and specifications, work write-ups, and other contract documents.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Approval of advances.</E> At all times, the loan must be kept in balance, and advances approved only if warranted by construction progress evidenced through HFA inspection, as well as in accord with plans, specifications, work write-ups and other contract documents. In approving advances, HFAs must make certain that other mortgageable items are supported with proper bills and/or receipts before funds can be approved and advanced for insurance.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Cost certification.</E> In order to ensure that the final amount for insurance is supported by certified costs:</P>
                <P>(i) The mortgagor (and general contractor, if there is an identity of interest with the mortgagor) must execute a certificate of actual costs, in a form acceptable to the HFA, when all physical improvements are completed to the satisfaction of the HFA and before final endorsement; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The cost certification provided by the mortgagor must be audited by an independent public accountant.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Contestability.</E> Although the HFA has authority to approve the mortgagor's (and general contractor's) certification of cost, the certification will be contestable by the Commissioner during the period up to and including final endorsement of the mortgage. After final endorsement, the certification will be final and incontestable except for fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the mortgagor (and/or general contractor).</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Assurance of completion.</E> The mortgagor must furnish assurance of completion of the project in accordance with any requirements of the HFA as to form and amount.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Latent defects escrow.</E> The mortgagor must furnish an escrow or other form of assurance required by the HFA to ensure that latent defects can be remedied within the time period required by the HFA.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Mortgagee of record.</E> The HFA must remain the mortgagee of record as long as mortgage insurance is in force.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Mortgagor.</E> The mortgage must be executed by a mortgagor determined eligible by the HFA.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">First lien.</E> The mortgage must be a single first lien on property that has first priority for payment and that conforms with property standards prescribed by the HFA.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Single asset mortgagor.</E> The mortgage must require that the mortgagor is a single asset mortgagor.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Amortization.</E> The mortgage must provide for complete amortization (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> regularly amortizing) over the term of the mortgage.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Use restrictions.</E> The mortgage must contain a covenant prohibiting the use of the property for any purpose other than the purpose intended on the day the mortgage was executed. The conversion of a project from rental to cooperative is not a “change in use” as that term is employed in the mortgage since the property will continue to have a residential use both before and after conversion.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Hazard insurance.</E> The mortgage must contain a covenant, acceptable to the HFA, that binds the mortgagor to keep the property insured by one or more standard policies for fire and other hazards stipulated by the HFA. A standard mortgagee clause making loss payable to the HFA must be included in the mortgage. The HFA is responsible for assuring that insurance is maintained in force and in the amount required by this paragraph and the mortgage. The HFA must ensure that the insurance coverage is in an amount that will comply with the coinsurance clause applicable to the location and character of the property, but not less than 80 percent of the actual cash value of the insurable improvements and equipment. If the mortgagor does not obtain the required insurance, the HFA must do so and assess the mortgagor for such costs. These insurance requirements apply as long as the HFA retains an interest in the project and final claim settlement has not been completed or the contract of insurance has not been otherwise terminated.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Modification of terms.</E> The mortgage must contain a covenant requiring that, in the event that the HFA and owner agree to a modification of the terms of the mortgage (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> to reflect a reduction of the interest rate if reductions are realized in the underlying bond rates for the project), Section 8 rents would be reduced in accordance with HUD guidelines.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Regulatory Agreement.</E> The mortgage must contain a provision incorporating the Regulatory Agreement by reference.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contractual obligations.</E> At the final closing of the loan, the mortgagor and the HFA must certify, and the HFA must determine, that all contractual obligations in connection with the mortgage transaction, including the purchase of the property and the improvements to the property, are paid. An exception is made for obligations that are approved by the HFA and determined by the HFA to be of a lesser priority for payment than the obligation of the insured mortgage.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Closing.</E> Before disbursement of loan advances in periodic advances cases, and in all cases after completion of construction, repair or substantial rehabilitation, the HFA must hold a closing and submit a closing docket with required documentation to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's <PRTPAGE P="537"/>authorized Departmental representative for insurance of the mortgage by endorsement of the mortgage note. The note must provide that the mortgage is insured under section 542(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and the regulations set forth at 24 CFR part 266 in effect on the date of endorsement. The note must also specify the date of endorsement, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the date of HUD endorsement of the project mortgage, and the risk of loss assumed by the HFA and by HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Closing docket.</E> The HFA's submission must include a certification that it has obtained written HUD approval of compliance with the requirements referred to in § 266.210, and certifications and information as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Information concerning the mortgage amount and term, location, number and type of units, income and expenses, rents, projects and market occupancy percentages, value/replacement cost, interest rate, and similar statistical information in accordance with the Commissioner's administrative procedures.</P>

                <P>(4) At the time of final endorsement, a certification for periodic advances cases, if submitted for final endorsement, that advances were made proportionate to construction progress.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Notice of default and filing an insurance claim.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition of default.</E> (1) A monetary default exists when the mortgagor fails to make any payment due under the mortgage.</P>
                  <P>(2) A covenant default exists when the mortgagor fails to perform any other covenant under the provision of the mortgage or the regulatory agreement, which is incorporated by reference in the mortgage. An HFA becomes eligible for insurance benefits on the basis of a covenant default only after the HFA has accelerated the debt and the owner has failed to pay the full amount due, thus converting a covenant default into a monetary default.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Date of default.</E> For purposes of this subpart, the date of default is:</P>
                  <P>(1) The date of the first uncorrected failure to perform a mortgage covenant or obligation; or</P>
                  <P>(2) The date of the first failure to make a monthly payment that is not covered by subsequent payments, when such subsequent payments are applied to the overdue monthly payments in the order in which they were due.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of default.</E> If a default (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) continues for a period of 30 days, the HFA must notify the Commissioner within 10 days thereafter, unless the default is cured within the 30-day period. Unless waived by the Commissioner, the HFA must submit this notice monthly, on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, until the default has been cured or the HFA has filed an application for an initial claim payment. In cases of mortgage acceleration, the mortgagee must first give notice of the default.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Timing of claim filing.</E> Unless a written extension is granted by HUD, the HFA must file an application for initial claim payment (or, if appropriate, for partial claim payment) within 75 days from the date of default and may do so as early as the first day of the month following the month for which a payment was missed. Upon request of the HFA, HUD may extend, up to 180 days from the date of default, the deadline for filing a claim. In those cases where the HFA certifies that the <PRTPAGE P="542"/>project owner is in the process of transacting a bond refunder, refinancing the mortgage, or changing the ownership for the purpose of curing the default and bringing the mortgage current, HUD may extend the deadline for filing a claim beyond 180 days, not to exceed 360 days from the date of default.</P>

The mortgage note interest component of the initial claim amount is subject to curtailment as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(2) HUD shall make an initial claim payment to the HFA that is equal to the initial claim amount, less any delinquent mortgage insurance premiums, late charges and interest, assessed under § 266.604(d).</P>
                  <P>(3) The HFA must use the proceeds of the initial claim payment to retire any bonds or any other financing mechanisms securing the mortgage within 30 days of the initial claim payment. Any excess funds resulting from such retirement or repayment shall be returned to HUD within 30 days of the retirement.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Curtailment of interest for late filings.</E> In determining the mortgage note interest component of the initial claim amount, if the HFA fails to meet any of the requirements of this section within the specified time (including any granted extension of time), HUD shall curtail the accrual of mortgage note interest by the number of days by which the required action was late.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Method of payment.</E> HUD shall pay the claim in cash.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When the Commissioner receives a claim for a partial payment under § 266.626(d), the Commissioner may make a partial payment of claim in accordance with the requirements of this section. If the HFA has not previously received a partial claim payment, the HFA may file a claim for a partial claim payment under § 266.630. Otherwise, the HFA must file for an initial claim payment under § 266.628.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">HFA submission.</E> In addition to any other requirements set forth in administration instructions, the HFA must provide the following information with its application for a partial claim payment:</P>
                  <P>(1) The amount by which the HFA will reduce the principal on the insured mortgage and the amount of delinquent interest on the insured mortgage that the HFA will defer based on the anticipated closing date; and</P>
                  <P>(2) A certification that:</P>
                  <P>(i) The amount of the principal reduction of the insured first mortgage does not exceed 50 percent of the unpaid principal balance;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The relief resulting from the partial claim payment when considered with other resources available to the project are sufficient to restore the financial viability of the project;</P>
                  <P>(iii) The project is or can (at reasonable cost) be made structurally sound;</P>
                  <P>(iv) The management of the project is satisfactory;</P>
                  <P>(v) The default under the insured mortgage was beyond the control of the mortgagor.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Claim processing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Acceptable application.</E> If the HFA's application is acceptable, the Commissioner shall notify the HFA to process the partial payment, which will include the modification of the existing mortgage and the execution by the mortgagor of a second mortgage payable to the HFA. When the second mortgage is closed, the HFA shall notify the Commissioner, in a form and manner prescribed in administrative instructions. Upon receipt of notice from the HFA, the Commissioner shall make the partial claim payment.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Unacceptable application.</E> If the application is unacceptable, the Commissioner shall either advise the HFA of the information needed to make the application acceptable or return the application for further action. The HFA is granted an extension of 30 days from the date of any notification for further action.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">One partial claim payment.</E> Only one partial claim payment may be made under a contract of insurance.<PRTPAGE P="543"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Partial claim payment amount.</E> The amount of the partial claim payment is equal to the amount of relief provided by the HFA in the form of a reduction in principal and a reduction of delinquent interest due on the insured mortgage times the lesser of HUD's percentage of the risk of loss or 50 percent.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">HFA second mortgage.</E> Repayment of the relief provided by the HFA must be secured by a second mortgage to the HFA. This second mortgage may provide for postponed amortization and may not be assigned by the HFA. This second mortgage is not insured under this part and may not be insured under any other HUD-related insurance program.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Partial claim repayment by HFA.</E> The HFA must remit to HUD a percentage of all amounts collected on the HFA's second mortgage within 15 days of receipt by the HFA. The applicable percentage is equal to the percentage used in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to determine the partial claim payment amount. Payments made after the 15th day must include a 5 percent late charge plus accrued interest at the debenture rate.</P>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Certified statements of amounts collected.</E> As long as the second mortgage remains of record, the HFA must submit to the Commissioner an annual certified statement of the amounts collected by the HFA. The HFA must submit a final certified statement within 30 days after the second mortgage is paid in full, foreclosed, or otherwise terminated.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Issuance of HFA Debenture.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Condition to initial claim payment.</E> The HFA must issue an instrument in the form of a debenture to HUD within 30 days of receiving the initial claim payment. The HFA Debenture shall meet the following requirements and shall be in a form that has been approved by HUD as part of the application approval process.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Term of HFA Debenture.</E> The HFA Debenture shall be dated the same date that the initial claim payment is <PRTPAGE P="544"/>issued. The HFA Debenture shall have a term of five years in order to afford the mortgagor ample time to cure the default or the HFA time to foreclose and/or resell the project. HUD may provide a written extension of the five year term if the HFA certifies and provides documentation that the project owner has filed bankruptcy and the HFA is taking action to have the project discharged from the bankruptcy. The HFA Debenture shall, during this extended period, continue to bear interest as described below at HUD's published debenture rate at the earlier of initial endorsement or final endorsement. Interest shall be due and payable annually on the anniversary date of the initial claim payment. Interest is due on the full face amount of the HFA Debenture through the term of the HFA Debenture or through the date an application for final claim payment is received by the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">HFA Debenture amount.</E> (1) The HFA Debenture shall be for the full initial claim amount as determined under § 266.628(a)(1) (minus any excess funds returned to HUD under § 266.628(a)(3)).</P>
                  <P>(2) The full amount of the HFA Debenture shall be payable to HUD upon maturity, unless the HFA Debenture is canceled because of:</P>
                  <P>(i) A reinstatement of the contract of insurance under § 266.634; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) Final claim settlement under § 266.654.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">HFA Debenture interest rate.</E> The HFA Debenture shall bear interest at HUD's published debenture rate at the earlier of initial endorsement or final endorsement. Interest shall be due and payable annually on the anniversary date of the initial claim payment and on the date of redemption when redeemed or canceled before an anniversary date. Interest shall be computed on the full face amount of the HFA Debenture through the term of the HFA Debenture.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Form of HFA Debenture.</E> The HFA Debenture should follow the standard form of a State/Municipal Debenture issued under the Uniform Commercial Code, where applicable, and shall be supported by the full faith and credit of the HFA. For HFAs that operate as departments or divisions of States or units of local government and where such HFAs cannot pledge the full faith and credit of the HFA, such HFAs may collateralize their obligation through a letter of credit, reinsurance, or other forms of credit acceptable to the Commissioner.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Debenture registration.</E> Unless otherwise required by law, including State or local laws, or other governing bodies, HUD will not require the HFA Debenture to be “Registered” (with the Securities and Exchange Commission) as it is a direct, or private, placement, and not a public offering, that is supported by the full faith and credit of the HFA.</P>

The appraisal must be done within the 45-day period immediately preceding the date when the HFA files an application for final claim settlement.

The funds must be remitted in a manner prescribed in the Commissioner's administrative procedures. The HFA Debenture will be considered redeemed upon receipt of the cash payment. A 5 percent penalty will be charged and interest at the debenture rate will begin to accrue if the cash payment is not received within the prescribed period. If an HFA is in default under an existing debenture and files a claim on another project under this part, HUD will charge the HFA's Dedicated Account for the amount owed the Department.

                <P>(ii) Assets that are not eligible under the terms of the securitization transaction to be included when determining whether the revolving pool securitization holds aggregate securitized assets in specified proportions to aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests issued; and</P>
                <P>(2) That is <E T="03">pari passu</E> with each series of investor ABS interests issued, or partially or fully subordinated to one or more series in identical or varying amounts, with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets prior to early amortization of the revolving securitization (as specified in the securitization transaction documents); and</P>
                <P>(3) That adjusts for fluctuations in the outstanding principal balance of the securitized assets in the pool.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of § 267.3 with respect to a securitization transaction for which the issuing entity is a revolving pool securitization if the sponsor maintains a seller's interest of not less than 5 percent of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests in the issuing entity.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Measuring the seller's interest.</E> In measuring the seller's interest for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) The unpaid principal balance of the securitized assets for the numerator of the 5 percent ratio shall not include assets of the types excluded from the definition of seller's interest in paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
                <P>(2) The aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator of the 5 percent ratio may be reduced by the amount of funds held in a segregated principal accumulation account for the repayment of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:</P>
                <P>(i) The terms of the securitization transaction documents prevent funds in the principal accumulation account from being applied for any purpose other than the repayment of the unpaid principal of outstanding investor ABS interests; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Funds in that account are invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in an eligible horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 267.4 are permitted to be invested;</P>
                <P>(3) If the terms of the securitization transaction documents set minimum required seller's interest as a proportion of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, rather than as a proportion of the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests in all outstanding series combined, the percentage of the seller's interest for each such series must, when combined with the percentage of any minimum seller's interest set by reference to the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests, equal at least 5 percent;</P>
                <P>(4) The 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied at the closing of each issuance of ABS interests to investors by the issuing entity, and</P>
                <P>(i) At least monthly at a seller's interest measurement date specified under the securitization transaction documents, until no ABS interest in the issuing entity is held by any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor; or</P>
                <P>(ii) If the revolving pool securitization fails to meet the 5 percent test as of any date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and the securitization transaction documents specify a cure period, the 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied within the earlier of the cure period, or one month after the date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Measuring outstanding investor ABS interests.</E> In measuring the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for purposes of this section, ABS interests held for the life of such ABS interests by the sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates may be excluded.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Holding and retention of the seller's interest; legacy trusts.</E> (1) Notwithstanding § 267.12(a), the seller's interest, and any offsetting horizontal retention interest retained pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, must be retained by the sponsor or by one or more wholly-owned affiliates of the sponsor, including one or more depositors of the revolving pool securitization.<PRTPAGE P="554"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) If one revolving pool securitization issues collateral certificates representing a beneficial interest in all or a portion of the securitized assets held by that securitization to another revolving pool securitization, which in turn issues ABS interests for which the collateral certificates are all or a portion of the securitized assets, a sponsor may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by retaining the seller's interest for the assets represented by the collateral certificates through either of the revolving pool securitizations, so long as both revolving pool securitizations are retained at the direction of the same sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates.</P>
                <P>(3) If the sponsor retains the seller's interest associated with the collateral certificates at the level of the revolving pool securitization that issues those collateral certificates, the proportion of the seller's interest required by paragraph (b) of this section retained at that level must equal the proportion that the principal balance of the securitized assets represented by the collateral certificates bears to the principal balance of the securitized assets in the revolving pool securitization that issues the ABS interests, as of each measurement date required by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Offset for pool-level excess funding account.</E> The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the balance, as of such date, of an excess funding account in the form of a segregated account that:</P>
                <P>(1) Is funded in the event of a failure to meet the minimum seller's interest requirements or other requirement to maintain a minimum balance of securitized assets under the securitization transaction documents by distributions otherwise payable to the holder of the seller's interest;</P>
                <P>(2) Is invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in a horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 267.4 are permitted to be invested; and</P>
                <P>(3) In the event of an early amortization, makes payments of amounts held in the account to holders of investor ABS interests in the same manner as payments to holders of investor ABS interests of amounts received on securitized assets.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Combined seller's interests and horizontal interest retention.</E> The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced to a percentage lower than 5 percent to the extent that, for all series of investor ABS interests issued after the applicable effective date of this § 267.5, the sponsor, or notwithstanding § 267.12(a) a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, retains, at a minimum, a corresponding percentage of the fair value of ABS interests issued in each series, in the form of one or more of the horizontal residual interests meeting the requirements of paragraphs (h) or (i).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Residual ABS interests in excess interest and fees.</E> The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for a residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, whether certificated or uncertificated, in a single or multiple classes, subclasses, or tranches, that meets, individually or in the aggregate, the requirements of this paragraph (h);</P>
                <P>(1) Each series of the revolving pool securitization distinguishes between the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows and the series' share of the principal repayment cash flows from the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization, which may according to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, include not only the series' ratable share of such cash flows but also excess cash flows available from other series;</P>

                <P>(2) The residual ABS interest's claim to any part of the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows for any interest payment period is subordinated to all accrued and payable interest due on the payment date to more senior ABS interests in the series for that period, and further reduced by the series' share of losses, including defaults on principal of the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization (whether incurred in that period or carried over from prior periods) to the extent that such payments would have been included in <PRTPAGE P="555"/>amounts payable to more senior interests in the series;</P>
                <P>(3) The revolving pool securitization continues to revolve, with one or more series, classes, subclasses, or tranches of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of assets that change in composition over time; and</P>
                <P>(4) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, and the fair value of the series of outstanding investor ABS interests to which it is subordinated and supports using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP, as of:</P>
                <P>(i) The closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The seller's interest measurement dates described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, except that for these periodic determinations the sponsor must update the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees for the numerator of the percentage ratio, but may at the sponsor's option continue to use the fair values determined in (h)(4)(i) for the outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Offsetting eligible horizontal residual interest.</E> The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for ABS interests that would meet the definition of eligible horizontal residual interests in § 267.2 but for the sponsor's simultaneous holding of subordinated seller's interests, residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, or a combination of the two, if:</P>
                <P>(1) The sponsor complies with all requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section for its holdings of subordinated seller's interest, and paragraph (h) for its holdings of residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, as applicable;</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests in the series supported by the eligible horizontal residual interest, determined using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP:</P>
                <P>(i) As of the closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Without including in the numerator of the percentage ratio any fair value based on:</P>
                <P>(A) The subordinated seller's interest or residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees;</P>
                <P>(B) the interest payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section in taking the offset in paragraph (g) of this section; and,</P>
                <P>(C) the principal payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of the seller's interest pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and distributions on that seller's interest are available to reduce charge-offs that would otherwise be allocated to reduce principal payable to the offset eligible horizontal residual interest.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Specified dates.</E> A sponsor using data about the revolving pool securitization's collateral, or ABS interests previously issued, to determine the closing-date percentage of a seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest pursuant to this § 267.5 may use such data prepared as of specified dates if:</P>
                <P>(1) The sponsor describes the specified dates in the disclosures required by paragraph (k) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(2) The dates are no more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors of disclosures required for the interest by paragraph (k) of this section, or for revolving pool securitizations that make distributions to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, no more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors of such disclosures.</P>

Submarkets, consisting of portions of units of general local government, may be used in large, complex metropolitan areas. Local housing markets having an adequate supply of standard-quality rental housing would include housing markets in which the supply of rental housing available and in production is adequate to meet the anticipated demand (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the housing market is balanced), as well as those in which there is an excess supply of rental housing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the housing market is soft). Rental markets that do not have an adequate supply (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> tight markets) are characterized by low rental vacancy rates, low levels of production and turnover of rental housing, and, usually, by high levels of rent inflation. HUD will make the determination of whether sufficient habitable, affordable, rental housing is available using established market analysis techniques, and will consider information that demonstrates:</P>
                <P>(1) The rental housing vacancy rate is at a low level relative to the rate required for a balanced market, typically a four percent vacancy rate; except that a rate lower than four percent may be considered in unusual circumstances if it can be demonstrated that there is an adequate supply of affordable housing for low-income families;</P>

                <P>(2) The number of rental housing units being produced on an annual <PRTPAGE P="591"/>basis is not large enough to satisfy demand arising from the increase in households, or, in markets where there is little or no growth, evidence that the number of additional rental units being supplied is not sufficient to meet the demand arising from net losses to the available inventory and the inadequate supply of rental housing has inhibited growth;</P>
                <P>(3) The shortage of housing is resulting in rent increases that exceed normal increases commensurate with the costs of operating rental housing;</P>
                <P>(4) A significant number, or proportion, of the households holding Section 8 certificates or rental vouchers are unable to find adequate housing because of the shortage of rental housing, including PHA data showing a lower than average percentage of units under lease and a longer than average time required to find units.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Unsubsidized project</E> means a multifamily housing project that is not a subsidized project.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Setting rental rates.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Because of the subsidies involved in making multifamily housing projects affordable, the setting of rents involves two steps: first, establishing the rent on a unit that will be paid to the owner, and second, determining the rent that the tenant pays (with the difference made up by a subsidy), using a number of procedures to obtain income verification and notify tenants of changes in rent. These procedures for a property owned by HUD or where HUD is mortgagee-in-possession are explained below.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Setting unit rents.</E> Except as modified by this section, for a property where HUD is mortgagee-in-possession (MIP), HUD will set unit rents in accordance with the rent setting requirements of the project's mortgage insurance or direct loan program; or for a property owned by HUD, rents will be set in accordance with the rent setting requirements of the project's mortgage insurance or direct loan program in effect immediately before HUD became the owner of the project.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Setting rents payable by tenants</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tenant rent.</E> The rent the tenant pays will be based on the income certification and the rent payment requirements of the project's mortgage insurance or direct loan program in effect while HUD is MIP or immediately before HUD became the owner of the project, as affected by any of the factors in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section. However, if a tenant does not certify income as required by this section, the tenant must pay the unit rent as determined under the rent setting requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Utility allowance.</E> For a tenant whose rent is based on a percentage of adjusted income (except for rental voucher or rental certificate holders), if the cost of utilities (except telephone) and other housing services for the unit is the responsibility of the tenant to pay directly to the provider of the utility or service, HUD will deduct from the rent to be paid by the tenant to HUD a utility allowance, which is an amount equal to HUD's estimate of the monthly costs of a reasonable consumption of the utilities and other services for the unit for an <PRTPAGE P="592"/>energy-conservative household of modest circumstances consistent with the requirement of a safe, sanitary, and healthful living environment. If the utility allowance exceeds the percentage of the tenant's adjusted income payable as rent, HUD will pay the difference between the amount payable as rent and the utility allowance to the tenant or, with the consent of the tenant and the utility company, either jointly to the tenant and the utility company or directly to the utility company.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Rent adjustments for project viability.</E> For a HUD-owned project, HUD may adjust the rent provided for in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section if necessary or desirable to maintain the existing economic mix in the project, prevent undesirable turnover, or increase occupancy.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Tenants who are rental voucher or rental certificate holders.</E> Tenants assisted with rental vouchers or certificates certify their income to the public housing agency (PHA) administering the assistance, and pay rent pursuant to the policies and procedures governing such assistance.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Income verification and rent notification procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Income certification by tenants</E>—(i) <E T="03">In subsidized projects.</E> (A) For families residing in subsidized projects, when HUD becomes MIP or owner, HUD will request an income certification from each family as soon as practicable after HUD initially assumes management, unless the family's income has been examined by the owner or by HUD not more than four months before HUD's assumption of management.</P>
                <P>(B) For each family applying for admission to subsidized projects, HUD will request an income certification to determine the family's eligibility for a subsidized rent, and (if the rent is based on a percentage of adjusted income) the family's subsidized rent, in accordance with part 813 of this title.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">In unsubsidized projects.</E> (A) For tenants in occupancy when HUD becomes mortgagee-in-possession or owner of an unsubsidized project, HUD may request an income certification from families who are not paying a subsidized rent.</P>
                <P>(B) For families applying for admission to such projects, HUD will request sufficient information for income verification to determine the family's ability to pay the unit rent.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of increases in the amount of rent payable.</E> Whenever HUD proposes an increase in rents in a HUD-owned multifamily project or a project where HUD is mortgagee-in-possession, HUD will provide tenants 30 days notice of the proposed changes and an opportunity to review and comment on the new rent and supporting documentation. After HUD considers the tenants' comments and has made a decision with respect to its proposed rent change, HUD shall notify the tenants of its decision, with the reasons for the decision. A tenant in occupancy before the effective date of any revised rental rate must be given 30 days notice of the revised rate, and any change in the tenant's rent is subject to the terms of an existing lease.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of section.</E> This section applies to all HUD-owned multifamily housing projects and all multifamily housing projects subject to HUD-held mortgages. When HUD is not the mortgagee-in-possession or owner, the owner of the project shall comply with this section, if HUD has authorized the demolition of, repairs to, or conversion of the use of the multifamily housing project.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimizing displacement.</E> Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, all reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations) from a project covered by this part. If displacement or temporary relocation will occur in connection with the disposition of a project, HUD may require the purchaser of the project to provide assistance in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance at non-URA levels.</E> Whenever the displacement of a residential tenant (family or individual) occurs in connection with the management or disposition of a multifamily housing project, but is not subject to paragraph (d) of this section (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> occurs as a direct result of HUD repair or demolition of all or a part of a HUD-owned multifamily housing project or as a direct result of the foreclosure of a HUD-held mortgage on a multifamily housing project or sale of a HUD-owned project without federal financial assistance), the displaced tenant shall be eligible for the following relocation assistance:</P>
                <P>(1) Advance written notice of the expected displacement shall be provided at least 60 days before displacement, describe the assistance and the procedures for obtaining the assistance, and contain the name, address and phone number of an official responsible for providing the assistance;</P>
                <P>(2) Other advisory services, as appropriate, including counseling, referrals to suitable (and where appropriate, accessible), decent, safe, and sanitary replacement housing, and fair housing-related advisory services;</P>
                <P>(3) Payment for actual reasonable moving expenses, as determined by HUD; and</P>
                <P>(4) Such other federal, State or local assistance as may be available.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Relocation assistance at URA levels</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The requirements of this paragraph apply to any displacement that results whenever assistance under 24 CFR part 886, subpart C, (or other federal financial assistance, as defined in 49 CFR 24.2(j)) is provided in connection with the purchase, demolition, or rehabilitation of a multifamily property by a third party. A displaced person (defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the URA, implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of “initiation of negotiations”.</E> Under the URA, for purposes of determining the method for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the transfer of title to the purchaser.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> The term “displaced person” means any person (family, individual, business, or nonprofit organization) that moves from the real property, or moves personal property from the real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation or demolition for a federally assisted project. However, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” if:</P>
                <P>(i) The person is excluded under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2);</P>

                <P>(ii) The person has been evicted for a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable federal, State, or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;<PRTPAGE P="595"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iii) The person moves into the property after transfer of title to the purchaser; or</P>
                <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Temporary relocation (URA and non-URA relocation assistance).</E> Residential tenants, who will not be required to move permanently, but who must relocate temporarily (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> to permit property repairs), shall be provided:</P>
                <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporary housing and any increase in monthly rent or utility costs. The party responsible for this requirement may, at its option, perform the services involved in temporarily relocating the tenants or pay for such services directly; and</P>
                <P>(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of the date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation; the suitable (and where appropriate, accessible), decent, safe, and sanitary housing to be made available for the temporary period; the terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex following completion of the repairs; and the right to financial assistance provided under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> If a person disagrees with the purchaser's determination concerning the person's eligibility for relocation assistance or the amount of the assistance for which the person is eligible, the person may file a written appeal of that determination with the owner or purchaser. A person who is dissatisfied with the purchaser's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that decision to the HUD Field Office responsible for administering the URA in the area.</P>

                <P>HUD may provide project-based assistance to support the rebuilding of a HUD-owned multifamily housing project only. The required determination that rebuilding the project would be less expensive than substantial rehabilitation means that the costs to HUD for rebuilding are such that the monthly debt service needed to amortize the cost of relocating tenants, demolition, site preparation, rebuilding, operating expenses, and a reasonable return to the purchaser cannot be provided with rents that are within 120 percent of the most recently published Section 8 Fair Market Rents for Existing Housing (24 CFR part 888, subpart A), and would be less expensive than rehabilitation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determination not to preserve a project or a part of a project.</SUBJECT>
                <P>HUD may determine to demolish, or otherwise dispose of, a HUD-owned multifamily housing project, or any portion of such a project, or to foreclose a HUD-held mortgage on a multifamily housing project, without ensuring its continued availability as affordable rental or cooperative housing for low- and very low-income families under appropriate circumstances which may include one or more those listed in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section. If HUD decides not to preserve an occupied multifamily housing project at a foreclosure sale or sale of a HUD-owned project, tenants must be provided relocation assistance as described in § 290.17.</P>
                <P>(a) The costs to HUD of rehabilitation are such that the monthly debt service needed to amortize the cost of rehabilitation, operating expenses, and a reasonable return to the purchaser cannot be provided with rents that are, for subsidized and formerly subsidized projects, within 120 percent of the most recently published Section 8 Fair Market Rents for Existing Housing (24 CFR part 888, subpart A) or, for unsubsidized and formerly unsubsidized projects, within rents obtainable in the market.</P>
                <P>(b) Construction is substantially incomplete.</P>
                <P>(c) Preservation is not feasible because of environmental factors that cannot be mitigated by HUD or the purchaser. For example, when the project is located on a site that cannot be made to comply with the Section 8 Site and Neighborhood standards in 24 CFR 886.307(k) because of factors that adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of residents such as air pollution; smoke; mud slides; fire or explosion hazards. Preservation may also be infeasible because of significantly deteriorated surrounding neighborhood conditions with inadequate police or fire protection; high crime rates; drug infestation; or lack of public community services needed to support a safe and healthy living environment for residents.</P>
                <P>(d) HUD determines the project is unfit for rehabilitation.</P>
                <P>(e) Rehabilitation would cost more than constructing comparable new housing.</P>
                <P>(f) A reduction in the number of units in the project will enhance long-term project viability, for example, demolition of a building to provide space for a playground, open space, or combining one-bedroom units to create larger units for families.</P>
                <P>(g) Continued preservation of the project as rental or cooperative housing is not compatible with State or local land use plans for the area in which the project is located.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible projects.</E> An up-front grant or loan can be made available in the sale of a HUD-owned multifamily housing project that meets all of the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) Has more than 50% of the units in the project occupied by very low-income residents at the time a disposition plan is approved by HUD, or that HUD determines is essential, as affordable housing, to the revitalization of its community;</P>
                <P>(2) Is located in a housing market or submarket in which there is not sufficient habitable, affordable, rental housing, as defined in § 290.3;</P>
                <P>(3) Will generate, after rehabilitation or rebuilding, sufficient rental income in a competitive market to cover all operating expenses, meet after sale debt service requirements, fund required reserves and throw off positive cash flow;</P>
                <P>(4) Will provide affordable housing for at least 20 years or the term of the loan, whichever is shorter, after the rehabilitation and/or rebuilding is completed; and</P>
                <P>(5) Meets such other requirements, including deed restrictions, loan provisions, and monetary penalties for non-performance, as HUD may determine are appropriate on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible sales and purchasers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Negotiated sales to governmental entities.</E> A negotiated sale of a project with an up-front grant or loan can only be made to the unit of general local government, which includes public housing agencies, in the area in which the project is located; or a State agency designated by the chief executive officer of the State in which the project is located; or an agency of the Federal government. The governmental entity in such a sale must take title to the project.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Other sales and purchasers.</E> All sales which provide up-front grants or loans to entities other than those described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be conducted through a competitive selection process. All general and limited partnerships or their nominees, joint ventures or other entities assembled for purposes of purchasing the project and which have a governmental entity as a partner or other participant are considered profit motivated purchasers and not governmental entities, whether or not there is a non-profit, public, corporate or individual general partner.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Up-front grant or loan amount.</E> The maximum that HUD will fund per project in an up-front grant or loan is 50 percent of total development cost (TDC), or $40,000 per affordable, finished unit, whichever amount is less. TDC covers demolition, environmental hazard remediation, construction materials, artisan services, professional services, developers services, and overhead, relocation and operating losses that are incurred to plan, perform and complete repairs or rebuilding.</P>

                <P>For any mortgage that, at the time HUD offers the mortgage for sale without FHA mortgage insurance, is delinquent and secures a subsidized project or unsubsidized project that receives any of the forms of assistance enumerated in paragraphs (4)(i) to (4)(iv) of the “subsidized project” definition in § 290.3:</P>
                <P>(a) The mortgage purchaser and its successors and assigns shall require the mortgagor to record a covenant running with the land as part of any loan restructuring or of a final compromise of the mortgage debt and shall include a covenant in any foreclosure deed executed in connection with the mortgage. The covenant shall continue in effect until the last federal project-based rental assistance contract expires by its own terms. The covenant shall provide that, except where otherwise approved by HUD, a project purchaser shall agree to assume the obligations of any outstanding:</P>
                <P>(1) Project-based federal rental subsidy contract; and</P>
                <P>(2) Tenant-based Section 8 housing assistance payments contract with a public housing agency and the related lease.</P>
                <P>(b) In the event of foreclosure of the mortgage sold by HUD, the mortgage purchaser and its successors and assigns:</P>
                <P>(1) Shall foreclose in a manner that does not interfere with any lease related to federal project-based assistance or any lease related to tenant-based, Section 8 housing assistance payments; and</P>
                <P>(2) Shall foreclose in manner that ensures that the right of possession of the purchaser at a foreclosure sale shall be subject to the terms of any residential lease not subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the remaining term of the lease or for one year, whichever period is shorter.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability to mortgages securing unsubsidized projects receiving project-based assistance (partially-assisted projects) or securing subsidized projects.</E> (1) The nondiscrimination requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies to the project owner upon the sale of a mortgage without FHA mortgage insurance if, at the time HUD offers it for sale, the mortgage secures:</P>
                <P>(i) An unsubsidized project that receives any of the forms of assistance enumerated in paragraphs (4)(i) to (4)(iv) of the “subsidized project” definition in § 290.5; or</P>

The mortgage purchaser and its successors and assigns shall require the mortgagor to record a covenant running with the land as part of any loan restructuring or final compromise of the mortgage debt and shall include a covenant in any foreclosure deed executed in connection with the mortgage. The covenant shall set forth the nondiscrimination requirement in paragraph (a) of this section. The covenant shall continue in effect until a date that is the same as the maturity date of the mortgage sold by HUD.</P>

                <P>(2) Neither HUD nor any transferor pursuant to §§ 291.90(a) or 291.200 will offer former mortgagors in occupancy who have defaulted on the mortgage the right of first refusal to repurchase the same property.</P>
                <P>(3) HUD will offer tenants accepted under the occupied conveyance procedures outlined in 24 CFR 203.670 through 203.685 the right of first refusal to purchase the property only if:</P>
                <P>(i) The tenant has a recognized ability to acquire financing and a good rent-paying history, and has made a request to HUD to be offered the right of first refusal; or</P>
                <P>(ii) State or local law requires that tenants be offered the right of first refusal.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">List price.</E> The list price, or “asking price,” assigned to the property is based upon one or more evaluation tools (e.g., appraisal, Broker Price Opinion, Automated Valuation Model). An appraisal, when used, must be conducted by an independent real estate appraiser who meets all of the requirements of 24 CFR part 200, subpart G, and is in good standing on the appraiser roster established under that section. The appraiser must provide an opinion of the “as-is” market value using a valuation method that is commonly employed in the industry and that is consistent with FHA appraisal requirements.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> When listing properties, HUD may elect to include information to indicate whether the property is eligible for FHA-insured financing under section 203(B) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Financing.</E> (1) Subject to underwriting requirements, REO properties that have not been identified as uninsurable in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section can be purchased and financed with a mortgage insured under section 203(b) or 203(k) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b), 1709(k)), if supported by an FHA appraisal, in one of the following ways:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Insured.</E> A property that meets the Minimum Property Standards (MPS), as defined in HUD Handbook 4905.1 or any successor handbook, as determined by the Secretary, for existing dwellings will be offered for sale in “as-is” condition with FHA mortgage insurance available as provided in part 203 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Insured with repair escrow.</E> (A) A property that requires no more than $10,000 for repairs to meet the MPS, as defined in HUD Handbook 4905.1 or any successor handbook, as determined by the Secretary, will be offered for sale in “as-is” condition with FHA mortgage insurance available, as provided in part 203 of this chapter, provided the mortgagor establishes a cash escrow to ensure the completion of the required repairs.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Changes in repair escrow.</E> HUD may adjust the escrow balance required under this paragraph based on changes to the Consumer Price Index by publishing a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice that provides for a public comment period of 30 calendar days for the purpose of accepting comments on the amount of the change. After comments have been considered, HUD will publish a final notice announcing the revised escrow amounts.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Insured with rehabilitation loan</E> in accordance with section 203(k) of the National Housing Act and pursuant to § 203.50 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(2) REO properties that have been identified as uninsurable in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section can be purchased and financed with a mortgage insured under section 203(k) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(k)), subject to underwriting requirements supported by an FHA-specified appraisal and in accordance with 24 CFR 203.50.</P>
                <P>(3) HUD, in its sole discretion and subject to appropriations, may take back Purchase Money Mortgages (PMMs) on property purchased by governmental entities or private nonprofit organizations who buy property for ultimate resale to owner-occupant purchasers with incomes at or below 115 percent of the area median income. When offered by HUD, a PMM will be available in an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, at market rate interest, for a period not to exceed 5 years. Mortgagors must meet FHA mortgage credit standards.</P>

                <P>(i) For purposes of this section, the term “purchase money mortgage,” or PMM means a note secured by a mortgage or trust deed given by a buyer, as <PRTPAGE P="603"/>mortgagor, to the seller, as mortgagee, as part of the purchase price of the real estate.</P>
                <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the purchaser is entirely responsible for obtaining financing for purchasing a property.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Environmental requirements and standards.</E> Sales under this part are subject to the environmental requirements and standards described in 24 CFR part 50, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(f) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Lead-based paint poisoning prevention.</E> Properties constructed before 1978 are subject to the requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at part 35, subparts A, B, F, and R, of this title.</P>
                <P>(h) Any real estate broker who has agreed to comply with HUD requirements may be eligible to participate in the sales program. Purchasers participating in the competitive sales program, except government entities and nonprofit organizations, must submit bids through a participating broker. In accordance with section 204(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(g)), HUD will prescribe the terms and conditions for all methods of listing properties. HUD may dispose of properties using any method that the Secretary deems appropriate, including, but not limited to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Open listings.</E> Properties may be sold on an open listing basis with participating real estate brokers.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Asset management and listing contracts.</E> (i) HUD may invite firms experienced in property management to compete for contracts that provide for an exclusive right to manage and list specified properties in a given area.</P>
                <P>(ii) In areas where a broker has an exclusive right to list properties, a purchaser may use a broker of his or her choice. The purchaser's broker must submit the bid through HUD's designated electronic bid system.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Disciplinary actions against HUD-qualified real estate brokers.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Real estate brokers that are involved in Real Estate Owned (REO) sales will be removed from HUD's qualified selling broker list and will be prohibited from using HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned single family properties for good cause in accordance with the procedures of this paragraph. Nothing in this section prohibits HUD from taking such other action against a broker as provided in 24 CFR part 24 or from seeking any other available remedy.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Good cause.</E> Good cause includes, but is not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Conviction under 18 U.S.C. 371 or 1010 of a broker or an agent supervised by that broker and acting within the scope of the agent's duties;</P>
                <P>(ii) Any of the following actions by a broker or an agent supervised by that broker and acting within the scope of the agent's duties:</P>
                <P>(A) Falsifying loan documents or aiding or abetting persons in the use of false or misleading information including, but not limited to, forged or fraudulent gift letters and owner occupant certifications;</P>
                <P>(B) Acting in concert with an appraiser to arrive at an artificial appraised value;</P>
                <P>(C) Engaging in fraudulent activities (with or without the assistance of an appraiser) that have led to default and payment of an insurance claim;</P>
                <P>(D) Failing to comply with earnest money collection, management, and disbursement procedures as set forth in this part;</P>
                <P>(E) Failing to maintain a current state license;</P>

                <P>(F) Violating the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
                <P>(G) Non-compliance with civil rights requirements regarding the sale of HUD-owned single family properties;</P>
                <P>(H) Involvement in, or knowledge of, any fraudulent activity by any person involved in the REO sales transaction; and</P>
                <P>(I) Any other actions or omissions that evidence a lack of business integrity or non-compliance with the laws, regulations, and rules applicable to housing, lending, or real estate sales.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Written notice.</E> Once HUD makes an initial finding that there is good cause to remove a broker, HUD will provide the broker with written notice <PRTPAGE P="604"/>of proposed removal from HUD's qualified selling broker list and deactivation of the broker's access to HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned properties. The notice will:</P>
                <P>(i) State the reasons that HUD is taking the action;</P>
                <P>(ii) Identify the violations or deficiencies involved;</P>
                <P>(iii) Provide a citation to the relevant regulation, statute, or policy; and</P>
                <P>(iv) State the effective date and duration of the removal and deactivation.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Effective date and duration of removal.</E> (i) The effective date of the broker's removal will be the 30th day after the date of the notice, unless the broker submits a written response or requests a conference in accordance with paragraph (i)(5) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) HUD's determination of the duration of removal and deactivation will be based upon HUD's consideration of the number and seriousness of the broker's violations and deficiencies.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Response and conference.</E> Real estate brokers will be given 20 days after the date of the notice (or longer, if provided in the notice) to submit a written response to HUD opposing the proposed removal and to request a conference. A request for a conference must be in writing and must be submitted along with the written response. If a conference is requested, it will occur within 15 days after the date of receipt of the request. HUD may extend the 15-day period by providing written notice to the broker. HUD may request additional information at or following a conference and provide additional time to submit such information. If the information is not submitted by the time set by HUD, the conference is completed. If the information is timely submitted, the conference is not completed until HUD has considered the additional information.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> (i) <E T="03">No response from real estate broker.</E> If the real estate broker does not submit a written response within the time provided, the removal and deactivation take effect in accordance with the notice.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Response from real estate broker.</E> If the real estate broker submits a written response within the time provided, the removal and deactivation are delayed until HUD considers the response and makes a final determination. HUD will consider the sufficiency of any corrective actions taken by a broker with respect to its procedures and, if relevant, its agents, in reaching its decision. Within 20 days after the date of receipt of the written response, or if a conference is requested, within 20 days after the date of completion of the conference, HUD will advise the real estate broker in writing of the decision to rescind, modify, or affirm the removal from HUD's qualified selling broker list and the deactivation of the broker's access to HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned properties. The written decision by HUD shall constitute final agency action.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Effect of removal proceeding on bids.</E> All bids submitted and commissions earned by the real estate broker prior to removal will be honored, unless HUD determines they were made under fraudulent circumstances.</P>

                <P>(a) Under this method of property disposition, HUD will enter into a property acquisition agreement (or agreements) with a transferor (or transferors), which shall provide for the right and obligation of the transferor(s) to acquire a future quantity of properties designated by HUD as they become available. The transferor(s) will be selected through a competitive process, conducted in accordance with applicable laws. HUD will negotiate the specific terms of the property acquisition agreement(s) with the selected transferor(s). The properties will be available on an “as-is” basis only, without repairs or warranties.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Competitive sales of individual properties.</SUBJECT>
                <P>When HUD conducts competitive sales of individual properties to individual buyers, it will generally sell the properties on an “as-is” basis, without repairs or warranties, and it will follow the sales procedures provided in this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Properties that are sold on an individual competitive bid basis are sold through local real estate brokers, except as provided in § 291.100(h).</P>
                <P>(2) For properties being offered with insured mortgages, priority will be given to owner-occupant purchasers, as defined in § 291.5, for a period of up to 30 days, as determined by HUD. For properties offered without insured mortgages, priority will be given to governmental entities and nonprofit organizations prior to other owner-occupant purchasers.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Net offer.</E> (1) The net offer is calculated by subtracting from the bid price the dollar amounts for the financing and loan closing costs and the broker's sales commission, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) If an owner-occupant purchaser of the property requests in the bid, HUD may pay all or a portion of the financing and loan closing costs, not to exceed the percentage of the purchase price determined appropriate by the Secretary for the area. In no event will the total amount for broker's sales commission exceed 6 percent of the purchase price, except for cash bonuses offered to brokers by HUD for the sale of hard-to-sell properties. No assistance for financing and loan closing costs or for the broker's sales commission will be provided to investor purchasers.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Acceptable bid.</E> HUD will accept the bid producing the greatest net return to HUD and otherwise meeting the terms of HUD's offering of the property, with priority given to owner-occupant purchasers as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The greatest net return is calculated based on the net offer, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Bid period.</E> (1) HUD will establish a bid period for properties available for sale. Generally, the bid period will be 10 days, but may be lengthened or shortened by HUD. After properties are initially advertised, bids may be submitted by all potential purchasers. However, in the case of properties offered with insured mortgages, HUD may give priority to owner-occupant purchasers for a period of up to 30-days, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD may treat all bids received during a specified period of time during the bid period to have been received simultaneously. HUD may also choose to review bids on a daily basis, with all bids submitted during each day considered to have been received simultaneously. HUD may use either (or both) of these methods during the bid period, as described in the bid materials accompanying a particular sale.</P>
                <P>(3) Offers received on a property before the bid period begins will be returned. Offers received after the bid period will not be considered at the bid opening, but will be considered during the extended listing period if no acceptable bid was received during the bid period (see paragraph (f) of this section).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Full price offers.</E> HUD local offices that operate under a “full price offer” program open offers at specified times during the bid period. If an offer for the full list price and otherwise meeting the terms of the offering is received, it will be accepted at the time of the opening and the bid period cancelled.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Extended listing period.</E> Properties not sold during the bid period will remain available for an extended listing period. All bids received on each day of the extended listing period will be considered as being received simultaneously, and will be opened together at the next scheduled daily bid opening. Properties that fail to sell within 45 days after being offered for competitive bidding will be reanalyzed and made available for sale. If a property's price or terms are changed, it may be subject to another competitive bid period as <PRTPAGE P="606"/>described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Bid requirements.</E> (1) All successful bids submitted, whether during the bid period or the extended listing period, must be in a form prescribed by HUD, and must be submitted in accordance with procedures established by HUD. If the purchase is to be an insured sale, a local HUD office may also require that supporting exhibits for mortgage credit analysis accompany the initial submission of the bid. All bids not indicating that the purchaser will occupy the property will be considered as offers from investor purchasers.</P>
                <P>(2) Noncomplying bids will be returned to the broker with an explanation for the noncompliance decision and information about whether the property is still available.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Earnest money deposits.</E> (1) The amount of earnest money deposit required for a property with a sales price of $50,000 or less is $500, except that for vacant lots the amount is 50 percent of the list price. For a property with a sales price greater than $50,000, the amount of earnest money deposit required in the area is set by the local HUD office, in an amount not less than $500 or more than $2,000. Information on the amount of the required earnest money deposit is available from the local HUD office or participating real estate brokers.</P>
                <P>(2) All bids must be accompanied by earnest money deposits in the form of a cash equivalent as prescribed by the Secretary, or a certification from the real estate broker that the earnest money has been deposited in the broker's escrow account. If a bid is accepted by HUD, the earnest money deposit will be credited to the purchaser at closing; if the bid is rejected, the earnest money deposit will be returned. Earnest money deposits are subject to total or partial forfeiture for failure to close a sale.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Multiple bids.</E> Real estate brokers may submit unlimited numbers of bids on an individual property provided each bid is from a different prospective purchaser. If a purchaser submits multiple bids on the same property, only the bid producing the highest net return to HUD will be considered. If a prospective owner-occupant purchaser submits a bid on more than one property, the bid that produces the greatest net return to HUD will be accepted and all other bids from that purchaser will be eliminated from consideration. However, if the prospective owner-occupant purchaser has submitted the only acceptable bid on another property, then that bid must be accepted and all other bids from that purchaser on any other properties will be eliminated from consideration.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Identical bids.</E> In the case of identical bids submitted by an owner-occupant purchaser and an investor purchaser, HUD will select the bid submitted by the owner-occupant purchaser. If identical bids are submitted by two or more owner-occupant purchasers, or by two or more investor purchasers, award will be determined by drawing lots.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Opening the bids.</E> Unless the Secretary specifically authorizes another bid process:</P>
                <P>(1) The Secretary will make all winning bids available publicly.</P>
                <P>(2) Successful bidders will be notified through their real estate brokers by electronic mail, mail, telephone, or other means. Acceptance of a bid is final and effective only upon HUD's execution of the sales contract, signed by both the submitting real estate broker and the prospective purchaser, and sending a copy of the executed contract by electronic mail to the successful bidder or the bidder's agent.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Counteroffers.</E> HUD may present counteroffers during competitive bid periods, as it deems appropriate to minimize losses to its insurance fund. “Best and Final” offers requested by HUD are considered counteroffers.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Direct sales procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>When HUD conducts the sales listed in § 291.90(c), it will sell the properties on an “as-is” basis, without repairs or warranties, and it will follow the applicable sales procedures provided in this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Direct sales of properties without insured mortgages to governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations.</E> (1) State and local governments, public <PRTPAGE P="607"/>agencies, and qualified private nonprofit organizations that have been preapproved to participate by HUD, according to standards determined by the Secretary, may purchase properties directly from HUD at a discount off the list price determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, but not less than 10 percent, for use in HUD and local housing or homeless programs.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must designate geographical areas of interest by ZIP code. Upon request, before those properties without insured mortgages are publicly listed, HUD will assure that governmental entities and nonprofit organizations are notified in writing when eligible properties become available in the areas designated by them. HUD will coordinate the dissemination of the information to ensure that if more than one purchaser designates a specific area, those purchasers receive the list of properties at the same time, based on intervals agreed upon between HUD and the purchasers. A property in this section will be sold to the first eligible purchaser submitting an acceptable contract. All bids received on the same business day will be considered to have been received simultaneously. In the case of identical bids submitted on the same business day, award will be determined by drawing lots.</P>
                <P>(ii) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must notify HUD of preliminary interest in specific properties within 5 days of the notification of available properties (if notification is by mail, the 5 days will begin to run 5 days after mailing). HUD will provide a consideration and inspection period for these purchasers. The consideration and inspection period will usually be for ten days from the date of notification of interest, but may be lengthened or shortened by HUD, as appropriate. Those properties in which purchasers express an interest will be held off the market for the duration of the consideration and inspection period. Other properties on the list will continue to be processed for public sale. HUD may limit the number of properties held off the market for a purchaser at any one time, based upon the purchaser's financial capacity as determined by HUD and upon past performance in HUD programs. At the end of the consideration and inspection period, properties in which no governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed a specific intent to purchase will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process. Properties in which a governmental entity or nonprofit organization expressed an intent to purchase, during the consideration and inspection period, will continue to be held off the market pending receipt of the sales contract. If a sales contract is not received within a time period of up to 10 days, as determined by HUD, following expiration of the consideration and inspection period, and no other governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed an interest, then the property will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process.</P>
                <P>(3) In order to ensure that properties purchased at a discount are being utilized for expanding affordable housing opportunities, HUD may require, as appropriate, periodic, limited information regarding the purchase and resale of such properties, and certain restrictions on the resale of such properties.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Direct sales to displaced persons; razed lots; auctions.</E> HUD may seek to dispose of individual properties to individual buyers through methods such as direct sales to displaced persons, sales of razed lots, or auctions. These sales will be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Direct sales to individuals or entities.</E> HUD may also seek to dispose of properties through direct sales to other individuals or entities that do not meet any of the categories specified in this section, if the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner (or his or her designee) finds in writing that such sales would further the goals of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and would be in the best interests of the Secretary. These sales will be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Bulk sales.</E> HUD may seek to dispose of properties through bulk sales. Such sales will be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</P>

                <P>This subpart sets forth HUD's policy and procedures for the sale of HUD-held single family mortgage loans. In general, HUD will sell both performing and nonperforming HUD-held single family mortgage loans. HUD will sell all mortgage loans without recourse and without FHA insurance. HUD will package pools of single family mortgage loans for sale to the general public on a competitive basis; however, HUD may sell mortgage loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) on a negotiated basis. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to prevent HUD from packaging single family mortgage loans with other types of HUD assets for sale. The Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying pool of mortgage loans for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered pool of mortgage loans from sale. However, when HUD offers a qualifying mortgage loan for sale, the procedures set out in this subpart and in the bid package will govern the sale of HUD-held single family mortgage loans.</P>

However, an individual, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity will not be eligible to bid for any loan pool, either as an individual or a participant, if, at the time of the sale, that individual or entity is debarred or suspended from doing business with HUD under 2 CFR part 2424.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Servicing requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of HUD-approved servicing mortgagees.</E> All mortgage loans must be serviced by HUD-approved servicing mortgagees for the remaining life of the mortgage loans. A purchaser that is not a HUD-approved servicing mortgagee must retain a HUD-approved servicing mortgagee to service the mortgage loans.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuation of mortgagor rights.</E> The purchaser may take all lawful steps to collect the amounts due under the mortgage loans. These steps may include foreclosure, but only after the servicer has provided all required forms of relief for the mortgagor in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The purchaser and its servicer, and any subsequent transferee of or servicer for the mortgage loan, will be fully bound by the terms of the Loan Sale Agreement, including those terms that provide the mortgagor with any rights regarding forbearance, assistance, or reinstatement of the mortgage loan.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Purchaser's protection of mortgagor's rights</E>—(1) <E T="03">Assigned mortgage loans during forbearance period.</E> This paragraph (c)(1) explains how a purchaser (or a servicer of a purchased mortgage loan) must service a mortgage loan that was assigned to HUD under section 230(b) of the National Housing Act (as that subsection existed prior to January 26, 1996), for which not more than 36 months has expired since the mortgage loan assignment was accepted by the Secretary. Such a purchaser must service these mortgage loans in essentially the same manner as HUD was required to service the loans while <PRTPAGE P="610"/>HUD held them. Specific servicing requirements will be set forth in the Loan Sale Agreement for each sale.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Assigned mortgage loans after the initial 36-month forbearance period.</E> This paragraph (c)(2) explains how a purchaser (or a servicer of a purchased mortgage loan) must service a mortgage loan that was assigned to HUD under section 230(b) of the National Housing Act (as that subsection existed prior to January 26, 1996), for which more than 36 months has expired since the mortgage loan assignment was accepted by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(i) Such purchaser may require the mortgagor to pay at least the full monthly payment due under the mortgage loan. A purchaser may also require a mortgagor to pay increased monthly mortgage loan payments under a renewed payment plan agreement to reduce the amount in arrears if the mortgagor's available income (as calculated according to the Loan Sale Agreement) can support the increased payments. A purchaser must renew payment plan agreements at least through and including the expiration of the original term of the mortgage loan, so long as the mortgagor complies with the prior payment plan agreement.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the mortgagor defaults under a payment plan agreement established by the purchaser, the mortgagor shall have the right to reinstate the most recent payment plan agreement if the mortgagor makes a lump sum payment in an amount necessary to cure the default. If the mortgagor defaults under the most recent payment plan agreement and does not reinstate, the purchaser may terminate the payment plan agreement and take such action as may be permitted under the terms of the mortgage.</P>
                <P>(iii) The purchaser's right to demand payment of a reinstatement amount from the mortgagor may be limited by the terms of the Loan Sale Agreement.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Section 221 Mortgages.</E> This paragraph (c)(3) explains how a purchaser (or a servicer of a purchased mortgage) must service a mortgage assigned to HUD under section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Current section 221(g)(4) mortgage loans.</E> Section 221(g)(4) mortgage loans that are current as of the closing date are not subject to the servicing requirements set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Defaulted section 221(g)(4) mortgage loans.</E> With respect to any section 221(g)(4) mortgage loan as to which a payment default has occurred, and as to which HUD, as of the closing date, was providing or had agreed to provide forbearance relief, the purchaser must continue to provide forbearance relief and must service such mortgage loans as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Section 235 mortgage loans</E>—(1) <E T="03">Assistance payments contract.</E> If, prior to the mortgage loan sale, the assistance payments contract has not been previously terminated under 24 CFR 235.375(a), the contract will terminate as to each mortgage loan upon the sale of the mortgage loan. The purchasing mortgagee will therefore not receive any assistance payments on behalf of the mortgagor for any Section 235 mortgage loan sold.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Reduction in interest rates.</E> For a Section 235 mortgage loan that was accompanied by an assistance payments contract that was still in effect on the date of the sale, the Secretary will reduce the interest rate on the mortgage loan to a rate to be determined by the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(2) Persons with disabilities who are about to be released from an institution and are at risk of imminent homelessness because no subsequent residences have been identified and because they lack the resources and support networks necessary to obtain access to housing.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Lease with option to purchase properties for use by the homeless.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Certification.</E> Eligible properties are available for lease to applicants, approved by HUD, that certify that the property will be utilized only for the purpose of providing transitional housing for the homeless during the lease term, and that the intended use of the property will be consistent with all local laws and regulations. The lease agreement will be in a form prescribed by the Secretary. Lessees must execute a sublease with occupants in a form prescribed by the Secretary limiting an occupant's tenancy to no longer than two years.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Term of lease.</E> (1) A lease of an eligible property may be negotiated for such time as the lessee requires, not to <PRTPAGE P="612"/>exceed one year. Leases are renewable, at the option of the lessee and with the approval of HUD, at the end of the first lease term for up to four additional one-year terms, on a year-to-year basis, provided the lessee has met the requirements under this program.</P>
                <P>(2) Approvals for lease renewals will be denied if HUD determines that the lessee has not complied with the requirements of this part of the lease.</P>
                <P>(3) A property will not be leased to a lessee for a period longer than five years. At the end of the five-year period, if the lessee has not exercised the option to purchase, HUD will notify the lessee to vacate the property and, if necessary, will take appropriate action under the eviction laws of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. All property returned to HUD must be vacant, and will be placed on the market for sale to the general public.</P>
                <P>(4) Within 30 days of leasing a property from HUD or within 30 days after a property is vacated, a lessee must sublease the property to the homeless, unless a longer period is approved by HUD.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Rent.</E> (1) The lessee must pay HUD a nominal rent of $1 for each one-year lease period.</P>
                <P>(2) A lessee may charge rent, including utilities, to an occupant at a rate appropriate to the financial means of the occupant. Unless HUD approves after consideration of such factors as the cost of operating housing in the area and the amount of the lessee's contributions to the program, such rent may not exceed the highest of:</P>
                <P>(i) Thirty percent of the family's monthly adjusted income (adjustment factors include the number of people in the family, age of family members, medical expenses, and child care expenses);</P>
                <P>(ii) Ten percent of the family's monthly income; or</P>
                <P>(iii) If the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of the payments, adjusted in accordance with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by the agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of the payments that is designated.</P>
                <P>(3) In no event may the rent charged an occupant exceed the occupant's pro rata share of the lessee's costs of operating the property.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Damage to leased properties.</E> Any damage to leased property caused by the intentional or negligent acts of the lessee or occupants must be repaired by the lessee at its own expense. If the lessee does not make the necessary repairs within a reasonable time after the damage occurs, HUD may, at its option, make the repairs and charge the cost to the lessee. Failure by the lessee to make the necessary repairs or to reimburse HUD for the cost of repairs will constitute grounds for termination of the lease and may result in termination from the program.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Purchase of leased properties.</E> (1) Lessees that desire to purchase leased properties during the lease term will be offered the properties at the lower of the fair market value established at the time of the initiation of the lease or at the time of the sale, less a discount determined appropriate by the Secretary but not less than 10 percent, provided lessees agree to use the properties either to house low-income tenants for a period of not less than 10 years or to resell the properties to low-income buyers. If the lessee does not agree to such conditions, the lessee must purchase the properties at the higher of the fair market value at the time of the initiation of the lease or at the time of the sale, less 10 percent. Any repairs to or rehabilitation of a property done by a lessee during the lease term will not be reflected in the purchase price.</P>
                <P>(2) Sales of leased properties will be on as-is, all-cash basis. HUD will not pay a fee for a selling broker. HUD will pay the closing agent's fee. The purchaser must pay all other closing costs.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Overview of the GNND Sales Program.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The GNND Sales Program enables a full-time law enforcement officer, teacher, or firefighter/emergency medical technician to purchase a specifically designated HUD-acquired home located in a HUD-designated revitalization area:</P>
                <P>(1) At a 50 percent discount from the list price; and</P>
                <P>(2) With a downpayment of $100, but only if the law enforcement officer, teacher, or firefighter/emergency medical technician finances the home through a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgage.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible properties.</E> Under the GNND Sales Program, single-unit properties acquired by HUD located in HUD-designated revitalization areas (except occupied properties, those located in Asset Control Areas, or those that HUD has determined will be sold through an alternative sales method) will be made available to interested law enforcement officers, teachers, and firefighters/emergency medical technicians prior to listing the properties for sale to other purchasers.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Multiple bids.</E> In the event that several bids are received on a single property, HUD will randomly select a winning offer by lottery and will also randomly select two backup bids, to be utilized in the order selected, in the event the winning purchaser is unable to close on the property. If both of the backup purchasers are also unable to close on the property, the property will then be made available for sale to purchasers through other sales methods.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Real estate brokers.</E> Law enforcement officers, teachers, and firefighters/emergency medical technicians must submit bids through a participating real estate broker. Any real estate broker who has agreed to comply with HUD requirements may participate in the GNND Sales Program. Real estate brokers may submit unlimited numbers of bids on an individual property provided each bid is from a different prospective purchaser.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Cap on sales.</E> The number of HUD-acquired homes sold under the GNND Sales Program in a fiscal year shall not exceed 5 percent of the number of “Part A” mortgage insurance conveyance claims paid by HUD in the prior fiscal year. The cap shall apply on a national basis, but HUD reserves the right to geographically apportion the cap to address regional or local differences in the number of homes sold through the GNND Sales Program. Additionally, HUD may adjust the percentage of the cap for any fiscal year. Any HUD determination to geographically distribute the cap, change a current geographic distribution, or adjust the percentage of the cap will be announced by HUD through publication of a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> at least 30 days before the revision takes effect.</P>

              <P>The Association is authorized by section 306(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)) upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of principal of and interest on securities that are based on and backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages which are insured or guaranteed by FHA, FmHA or VA. The Association's guaranty of mortgage-backed securities is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. This subpart is limited to “modified pass-through” securities, and does not purport to set forth all the procedures and requirements that apply to the issuance and guaranty of such securities. All such transactions are governed by the specific terms and provisions of the Association's Mortgage-Backed Securities Guides (MBS Guides) and contracts entered into by the parties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible issuers of securities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility requirements.</E> A mortgage lender, including an instrumentality of a State or local government, to be eligible to issue or service mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Association must satisfy all of the following standards:</P>
              <P>(1) Be in good standing as a mortgagee approved by the FHA;</P>

              <P>(2) Be in good standing as a mortgage seller or servicer approved by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or the Association. Loss of either FNMA approval or FHLMC approval may cause <PRTPAGE P="623"/>the issuer to become ineligible to issue and service the Association's mortgage-backed securities and constitute a default under the applicable guaranty or contractual agreement whether or not the issuer qualified for new issuer approval on the basis of FNMA or FHLMC approval;</P>
              <P>(3) Have management with adequate experience, and access to adequate facilities to issue or service mortgage-backed securities, as determined by the Association;</P>
              <P>(4) Maintain the applicable minimum net worth discussed in paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(5) Meet the requirements, conditions, and limitations prescribed by the Association in this part or the applicable MBS Guides.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time of eligibility.</E> The Association shall not commit to guarantee, or guarantee any issue of mortgage-backed securities unless the mortgage lender requesting such commitment or guaranty qualifies as an eligible issuer both at the time of commitment approval and at the time of the issuance of the guaranty.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Net worth requirements.</E> Issuers shall maintain at all times a net worth acceptable to the Association of not less than the applicable minimum amount. The applicable minimum amount shall be published in the MBS Guides.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disqualification.</E> A mortgage lender shall not qualify as an eligible issuer at any time in which:</P>
              <P>(1) The lending policies of the issuer permit any discrimination based on race, religion, color, national origin, age, or sex of a borrower; or</P>
              <P>(2) The issuer is not in compliance with any rules, regulations, or orders issued under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Executive Order 11063, Equal Opportunity in Housing, November 20, 1962; Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity, issued on September 24, 1965 and amended on October 13, 1967; title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968; title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988; or by the FHA or VA.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Ethics and standards.</E> A mortgage lender shall qualify as an eligible issuer only so long as it conducts its business operations in accordance with accepted mortgage banking practices, ethics, and standards, as determined by the Association, and maintains its books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Change in control.</E> Issuers shall notify the Association of any change in issuer control. A change in control occurs whenever a new party obtains significant influence over an issuer, as defined by the Association. In a merger where the surviving party is not the approved issuer and in a consolidation, the surviving party must apply formally for approval as a new issuer prior to the merger or consolidation taking place. In other business combinations, such as a stock sale of an existing issuer, which result in a change in control of issuer, the issuer shall demonstrate that it continues to meet all issuer eligibility requirements prior to the business combination being finalized.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Cross-Default.</E> Related issuers, as defined by the Association, shall execute a cross-default agreement, in a form prescribed by the Association, that authorizes the default of one or more related issuers in the event of a default by any one of the related issuers. Issuers may be granted an exemption from this section, provided that they submit a legal opinion, acceptable to the Association, which demonstrates that the execution of a cross-default agreement would be prohibited by the issuer's Federal regulator.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Failure to comply.</E> In the event that an issuer subsequently fails to comply with any of the requirements prescribed in this part or the applicable MBS Guide, as determined by the Association, the Association may, among other things, withhold further commitments to guarantee securities until such time as the Association is satisfied that the issuer has resumed business operations in compliance with such requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Securities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Instruments.</E> Securities issued pursuant to the provisions of this subpart must be modified pass-through securities, that provide for payment, whether or not collected, of both specified principal installments and interest on the unpaid principal balance, with all prepayments and other unscheduled recoveries of principal being passed through to the holder. In the case of delinquent mortgages in a pool backing modified pass-through securities, the issuer is required to make advances if necessary to maintain the specified schedule of interest and principal payments to the holders, or at its option, at any time 90 days or more after default of any such mortgage, the issuer may repurchase such mortgage for an amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage. The securities, if issued in certificated form, must specify the dates by which payments are to be made to the holders thereof, and must indicate the accounting period for collections on the pool's mortgages relating to each such payment, and the securities, if issued in certificated form, must also specify a date on which the entire principal will have been paid or will be payable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Issue amount.</E> Each issue of guaranteed securities must be in a minimum face amount as specified in the applicable MBS Guide. The total face amount of any issue of securities cannot exceed the aggregate unpaid principal balances of the mortgages in the pool. The Association may provide for issuers to submit packages of mortgages that may be consolidated, with other packages of similar types of mortgages, into multiple issuer pools.</P>
              <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transferability.</E> Securities are transferable, but the share of the proceeds collected on account of the pool of mortgages is payable only to the registered holder of a security according to the policies established by the Association.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Issue Date.</E> Securities backed by single-family mortgages with issue dates of October 1, 1998, or before, serial notes with issue dates of July 1, 2002, or before, and securities backed by multifamily mortgages with issue dates of February 1, 2002, or before, have been issued in certificated form. Securities issued after these dates will be issued in book-entry form. The Association may approve the issuance of certificated securities for good cause.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Delivery.</E> Delivery of uncertificated securities occurs when the book-entry depository's nominee is registered as the registered owner of the securities on Ginnie Mae's central registry.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Registered Ownership.</E> Ownership of mortgage-backed securities issued pursuant to this subpart registered in the name of a Depository shall be conclusively established by registration in the name of the Depository as owner on the Association's central registry and it shall be unnecessary for a Depository to maintain custody of any physical certificates evidencing such ownership.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Payments on Mortgage-Backed Securities.</E> Issuers must remit all payments due to holders of mortgage-backed securities such that holders will receive their installments as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Payment to a Depository.</E> (i) For all securities registered in the name of a Depository or the designated nominee for a Depository, issuers are required to make payments in immediately available funds by ACH transaction, Fedwire, or by such other method as directed and/or authorized by the Association pursuant to the MBS Guide, including requiring that issuers maintain funds accounts in institutions that are accessible by debit ACH transactions originated by such Depository or its designee.</P>
              <P>(ii) Payment must be made by the hour specified in the MBS Guide on the calendar day of the month specified in the MBS Guide for payment on such mortgage-backed securities (the “applicable Payment Date”), with adjustments to such time as may be specified in the MBS Guide for Payments Dates that do not fall on business days.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payments to other holders.</E> An issuer of mortgage-backed securities that are not registered in the name of a Depository or its nominee may make payments to a security holder by ACH transaction or Fedwire, provided that it obtains the prior written approval of <PRTPAGE P="625"/>the holder of such mortgage-backed securities. If an issuer begins to make such payments by electronic transfer, it must continue to do so while the securities are registered in the name of that security holder. If an issuer makes payments on mortgage-backed securities by check, the check must be received by the security holder not later than the applicable Payment Date each month.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Guaranty.</E> The Association's guaranty described in § 320.13 is a guaranty that payment will be made to the registered owner of securities as reflected in the Association's central registry. The Association makes no other guaranty, including any guaranty that a Depository will appropriately credit payments to beneficial owners of such mortgage-backed securities. The Association's guarantee of securities payable to a Depository or its nominee becomes effective when the Depository or its nominee is registered as the registered owner of the securities on the Association's central registry.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Definition of Depository.</E> As used in this section, Depository means a clearing corporation within the meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, including any Federal Reserve Bank, that maintains systems by which ownership and transfer of interests in mortgage-backed securities are made through the books of such clearing corporation.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this part is to achieve the efficiencies and fungibility through use of a single system for transferring interests both in Ginnie Mae Securities and other United States Government securities and in mortgage-backed securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The Association only guarantees that payments required to be made by issuers of Ginnie Mae Securities will be made to the registered owner of those Ginnie Mae Securities. The Association undertakes no other obligation. Under the Book-entry System, the Federal Reserve Banks will be the registered owner of Book-entry Ginnie Mae Securities, not the agent of the Association, and the Association makes no warranty or guaranty with respect to the maintenance of the Book-entry System by the Federal Reserve Banks.</P>

            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following rights and obligations are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this part, the Securities Documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars (but not including any choice of law provisions in the Security Documentation to the extent such provisions conflict with the Book-entry regulations contained in this part):<PRTPAGE P="633"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) The rights and obligations of a Federal Reserve Bank as a Depository with respect to:</P>
            <P>(i) A Book-entry Ginnie Mae Security or Security Entitlement; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The operation of a book-entry system operated by a Depository as it applies to Ginnie Mae Securities; and</P>
            <P>(2) The rights of any Person, including a Participant, against the Federal Reserve Banks as Depositories with respect to:</P>
            <P>(i) A Book-entry Ginnie Mae Security or Security Entitlement; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The operation of the book-entry system operated by the Federal Reserve Banks as Depositories as it applies to Ginnie Mae Securities.</P>
            <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 350.5(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 350.5(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.</P>
            <P>(d) To the extent not otherwise inconsistent with this part, and notwithstanding any provision in the Security Documentation setting forth a choice of law, the provision set forth in 31 CFR 357.11 regarding law governing other interests apply and shall be read as though modified to effectuate the application of 31 CFR 357.11 to Book-entry Ginnie Mae Securities.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 350.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; Security Interests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry Ginnie Mae Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.</P>
            <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interests in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.</P>

            <P>(c)(1) The Federal Reserve Banks as Depositories have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank as Depository marking its books to record the security interest. Except <PRTPAGE P="634"/>as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 350.4(b) or (d). The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.</P>

            <P>Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 350.5(c)(1), for the purposes of this part, the Federal Reserve Banks as Depositories shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an interest in a Book-entry Ginnie Mae Security has been credited as the person exclusively entitled to issue a Transfer Message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such Security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. The Federal Reserve Banks as Depositories are not liable to a Person asserting or having an adverse claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry Ginnie Mae Security in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry Ginnie Mae Security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.</P>

No such conversion shall affect existing interests in such Ginnie Mae Securities.<PRTPAGE P="635"/>

              <P>(iii) Is taking an adverse position to HUD or to an owner whose project is covered by a PRA in a lawsuit, administrative proceeding, or other contested matter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Control</E> means the power to vote, directly or indirectly, 25 percent or more of any class of the voting stock of a company; the ability to direct in any manner the election of a majority of a company (or other entity's) directors or trustees; or the ability to exercise a controlling influence over the company or entity's management and policies.

              <P>(2) The PAE must establish procedures to identify conflicts of interest and to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise or continue, subject to waiver under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD will not enter into PRAs with potential PAEs who have conflicts of interest associated with a particular project, or permit PAEs to continue performance under existing PRAs when such PAEs have conflicts of interest, unless such conflicts have been eliminated to HUD's satisfaction by the PAE or potential PAE or are waived by HUD.</P>

              <P>(4) The PAE has a continuing obligation to take all action necessary to <PRTPAGE P="645"/>identify whether it or any other restricted person has a conflict of interest.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Review by HUD.</E> Subject to the restrictions set forth in this section, HUD in its sole discretion may determine whether a conflict of interest exists, may waive the conflict of interest, or may approve in writing a PAE's proposal to eliminate a conflict of interest.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest that arise or are discovered after PAE selection.</E> (1) A PAE must notify HUD in writing within 10 days after discovering that it or another restricted person has a conflict of interest. Such notification must contain a detailed description of the conflict of interest and state how the PAE intends to eliminate the conflict. The PAE may also request a determination as to the existence of a conflict.</P>
              <P>(2) HUD will, after receipt of such notification or other discovery of the PAE's conflict or potential conflict of interest, take such action as it determines is in its best interests, which may involve proceeding under § 401.313 or as provided in the following sentences. HUD may notify the PAE in writing of its findings as to whether a conflict of interest exists and the basis for such determination, whether or not a waiver will be granted, or whether corrective actions may be taken in order to eliminate the conflict of interest. Corrective action must be completed by the PAE not later than 30 days after notification is mailed by HUD unless HUD, at its sole discretion, determines that it is in its best interests to grant the PAE an extension in which to complete the corrective action.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reconsideration of decisions.</E> Decisions issued pursuant to this section may be reconsidered by HUD upon application by the PAE. Such requests must be in writing and must contain the basis for the request.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When are comparable market rents required?</E> The Restructuring Plan must establish restructured rents for project-based assistance at comparable market rents unless the PAE finds that exception rents are necessary under § 401.411.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Comparable market rents defined.</E> Comparable market rents are the rents charged for properties that the PAE determines to be comparable properties (as defined in section 512(1) of MAHRA, but also excluding section 202 or section 811 projects assisted under part 891 of this title). For purposes of section 512(1), other relevant characteristics include any applicable rent control and other characteristics determined by the PAE.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When do exception rents apply?</E> (1) The Restructuring Plan may provide for exception rents established under section 514(g)(2) of MAHRA for project-based assistance if the PAE determines that project income under the rent levels established under § 401.410 would be inadequate to meet the costs of operating the project as described in paragraph (b) of this section and that the housing needs of the tenants and the community could not be adequately addressed.</P>
              <P>(2) In any fiscal year, the PAE may not request HUD to approve Restructuring Plans with exception rents for more than 20 percent of all units covered by the PRA, except that HUD may approve a waiver of this 20 percent limitation based on the PAE's narrative explanation of special need.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How are exception rents calculated?</E> (1) Exception rents must be set at a level sufficient to support the costs of operating the project. The PAE must take into account the following cost items:</P>

              <P>(C) Other eligible costs permitted under the section 8 program;</P>
              <P>(iii) An adequate allowance for potential operating losses due to vacancies and failure to collect rents, as determined by the PAE;</P>
              <P>(iv) A return to the owner to the extent permitted by § 401.461(b)(3)(ii)(A); and</P>
              <P>(v) Other expenses determined by the PAE to be necessary for the operation of the project.</P>
              <P>(2) The exception rent must not exceed 120 percent of the Fair Market Rent for the market area, except that HUD may approve an exception rent greater than 120 percent of Fair Market Rent, based on a narrative explanation of special need submitted by the PAE, subject to the 5 percent limitation in section 514(g)(2)(A) of MAHRA.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rejection due to poor condition of the project.</E> Based on the completed PCA, the PAE must determine whether proceeding with a Restructuring Plan with necessary rehabilitation is more cost-effective in terms of Federal resources than rejecting the Request for a Restructuring Plan under § 401.403(b)(2)(iii) and providing tenant-based assistance for displaced tenants under § 401.602. HUD will provide guidance to PAEs for making the determination. If the PAE concludes that a request for a Restructuring Plan should be rejected because of lack of cost-effectiveness due to poor condition of the project, it must also consider the effect on tenants and the community and advise HUD of the effect.

              <SUBJECT>Property standards for rehabilitation.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The restructuring plan must provide for the level of rehabilitation needed to <PRTPAGE P="652"/>restore the property to the non-luxury standard adequate for the rental market for which the project was originally approved. If the standard has changed over time, the rehabilitation may include improvements to meet the current standards. The rehabilitation also may include the addition of significant features, in accordance with § 401.472. The result of the rehabilitation should be a project that can attract non-subsidized tenants, but competes on rent rather than on amenities. When a range of options exists for satisfying the rehabilitation standard, the PAE must choose the least costly option considering both capital and operating costs and taking into account the marketability of the property and the remaining useful life of all building systems. Nothing in this part exempts rehabilitation from the requirements of part 8 of this title concerning accessibility to persons with disabilities.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Principal amount.</E> As part of the Restructuring Plan, the PAE will determine the size of the restructured first mortgage that will result from the modification or refinancing of the existing FHA-insured or HUD-held first mortgage. The restructured first mortgage must be in the amount that can be supported by net operating income based on the lower of the restructured section 8 rents or the rents allowed by the Use Agreement under § 401.408. Neither the outstanding principal balance of the existing first mortgage, nor the monthly principal and interest payments on that debt, may be increased through modification under the Restructuring Plan. The debt service coverage used by the PAE must be adequate for purposes of the Restructuring Plan and for the requirements of any refinancing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fully amortizing.</E> The modified or refinanced first mortgage must be fully amortizing through level monthly payments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rates and other terms.</E> Interest rates and other terms of the modified or refinanced first mortgage must be competitive in the market.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees.</E> Any fees or costs associated with mortgage modification or refinancing determined by the PAE to be above normal processing fees must be paid by the owner from non-project funds and must not be included in the modified or refinanced first mortgage.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Refinancing.</E> (1) The owner must contact the mortgagee to determine the mortgagee's willingness to consider a modification and re-amortization of the existing first mortgage through a Restructuring Plan before considering any other source of first mortgage financing. If the mortgagee does not agree to modify and re-amortize in accordance with the Restructuring Plan, the loan must be refinanced.</P>
              <P>(2) The refinancing may be either without credit enhancement or with credit enhancement under one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">FHA mortgage insurance.</E> If the Restructuring Plan provides for FHA mortgage insurance for the refinanced first mortgage, the insurance will be provided in accordance with all usually applicable FHA legal requirements except that insurance will be documented as provided in section 517(b)(2) of MAHRA. HUD will issue the commitment for mortgage insurance but may adapt its procedures as necessary to facilitate development and implementation of a Restructuring Plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other FHA credit enhancement.</E> If FHA credit enhancement, including risk-sharing, is provided under part 266 of this title, the credit enhancement will be provided in accordance with all usually-applicable FHA legal requirements under part 266 of this title, except that special approval from HUD will be required before the PAE engages in risk-sharing with FHA under part 266 of this title. HUD will approve risk-sharing financing that complies with part 266 whenever required by section 517(b)(3) of MAHRA.<PRTPAGE P="653"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Credit enhancement from non-FHA sources.</E> If credit enhancement is to be provided by a non-FHA source under section 517(b)(4) of MAHRA, HUD will consider waiver of any non-statutory provision in this part only if the waiver will not materially impair achievement of the purposes of MAHRA and if the waiver is essential to meet the legitimate business or legal requirements of the provider of credit enhancement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>HUD-held second mortgage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount.</E> (1) The Restructuring Plan must provide for a second mortgage to HUD whenever the Plan provides for either payment of a claim under section 541(b) of the National Housing Act (541(b) claim) or the modification or refinancing of a HUD-held first mortgage that results in a first mortgage with a lower principal amount. The term “second mortgage” in this section also includes a new HUD-held first mortgage (not a refinancing mortgage), if a full payment of claim is made under § 401.471 or if a full payment of claim is unnecessary because surplus project accounts are available to facilitate the Restructuring Plan, pursuant to section 517(b)(6) of MAHRA, or if § 401.460(a) does not permit a restructured first mortgage in any amount.</P>
              <P>(2) The second mortgage must be in a principal amount that does not exceed the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount the PAE reasonably expects to be repaid based on objective criteria such as the amount of anticipated net cash flow, trending assumptions, amortization provisions, and expected residual value of the property; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The greater of:</P>
              <P>(A) The section 541(b) claim (or the difference between the unpaid principal balance on HUD-held mortgage debt immediately before and after the restructuring), plus surplus project accounts from residual receipts accumulated pursuant to 24 CFR 880.205(e), 881.205(e), or 883.306(e) and derived from an expiring Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments contract and not otherwise distributed to the owner and made available to facilitate the Restructuring Plan pursuant to section 517(b)(6) of MAHRA, and</P>
              <P>(B) The difference between the unpaid balance on the first mortgage immediately before and after the restructuring.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Terms and conditions.</E> (1) The second mortgage must have an interest rate of at least one percent, but not more than the applicable Federal rate.</P>
              <P>(2) The second mortgage must have a term concurrent with the modified or refinanced first mortgage, if any. HUD may provide that if there is no first mortgage, the second mortgage may continue for a term established by HUD.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Principal and interest on the second mortgage is payable only out of net cash flow during its term. “Net cash flow” means that portion of project income that remains after the payment of all required debt service payments on the modified or refinanced first mortgage, if any, including payment of any past due principal or interest, and payment of all reasonable and necessary operating expenses (including deposits to the reserve for replacement account) and any other expenditure approved by HUD.</P>
              <P>(ii) The priority and distribution of net cash flow is as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) HUD or the PAE may approve the payment to the owner of up to 25 percent of net cash flow based on consideration of relevant conditions and circumstances including, but not limited to, compliance with the management standards prescribed in § 401.560 and the physical condition standards prescribed in § 401.558; and</P>
              <P>(B) All remaining net cash flow will be applied to the principal and interest on the second mortgage, until paid in full, and then to any additional subordinate mortgage under § 401.461(c).</P>

              <P>(4) HUD may cause the second mortgage to be immediately due and payable on the grounds provided in section 517(a)(4) of MAHRA, including an assumption of the mortgage in violation of HUD standards for approval of transfers of physical assets (if applicable), or if the owner materially fails to comply with other material HUD requirements after a reasonable opportunity for the owner to cure such failure. A decision by HUD in this regard is subject to the <PRTPAGE P="654"/>administrative appeals procedure in subpart F of this part, unless HUD acts on the basis of the grounds specified in sections 517(a)(4)(A) or (B) of MAHRA.</P>
              <P>(5) HUD will consider modification, assignment to the acquiring entity, or forgiveness of all or part of the second mortgage, if: The Secretary holds the second mortgage; and if the project has been sold or transferred to a tenant organization or tenant-endorsed community-based nonprofit or public agency that meets eligibility guidelines determined by HUD; accepts additional affordability requirements acceptable to HUD; and requests such modification, assignment, or forgiveness. A community-based nonprofit group or public agency demonstrates that it is tenant-endorsed in accordance with § 401.480(e).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional mortgage to HUD.</E> (1) A Restructuring Plan shall require the owner to give an additional mortgage on the project to HUD in an amount that:</P>
              <P>(i) For the restructuring of a mortgage insured by HUD, does not exceed the difference between:</P>
              <P>(A) The amount of a section 541(b) claim paid under § 401.471 increased by any residual receipts, pursuant to 24 CFR 880.205(e), 881.205(e), or 883.306(e); and</P>
              <P>(B) The principal amount of the second mortgage; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For the restructuring of a mortgage held by HUD, does not exceed the difference between:</P>
              <P>(A) The principal amount of a restructured HUD-held mortgage and the sum of, as applicable, a restructured HUD-held first mortgage at reduced principal amount, new mortgage funds paid to HUD at closing, and surplus project accounts other than residual receipts, pursuant to 24 CFR 880.205(e), 881.205(e), or 883.306(e); and</P>
              <P>(B) The principal amount of the second mortgage.</P>
              <P>(2) HUD may approve a Plan that does not require an additional mortgage, or provides for less than the full difference to be payable under the additional mortgage, or allows for subsequent modification, assignment, or forgiveness of the additional mortgage under any of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) The anticipated recovery on the additional mortgage is less than the servicing costs; or</P>
              <P>(ii) HUD has approved modification, assignment, or forgiveness of the second mortgage, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) With respect to the second mortgage required by paragraph (a) of this section, any additional mortgage must:</P>
              <P>(i) Be junior in priority;</P>
              <P>(ii) Bear interest at the same rate; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Require no payment until the second mortgage is satisfied, at which time it will be payable upon demand of HUD or as otherwise agreed by HUD.</P>

The PAE may propose a lower or higher owner contribution, not to exceed 20 percent, with respect to significant additions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other rehabilitation.</E> With respect to other rehabilitation, the required owner contribution will be calculated as 20 percent of the total cost of rehabilitation, unless HUD or the PAE determines that a higher percentage is required. The owner contribution must include a reasonable proportion (as determined by HUD) of the total cost of rehabilitation from nongovernmental resources.</P>

The failure to consummate a sale or transfer of the property requested under paragraph (a) of this section will <PRTPAGE P="656"/>neither adversely affect an owner's eligibility for a Restructuring Plan nor exempt the owner from the requirements of § 401.600.

This notice must be received by the PAE no later than 30 days after a notice of rejection under § 401.101 or § 401.403 has become a final determination under subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner must cooperate in selling or transferring the property. Failure to do so will result in the PAE's determination to reject the owner's request for a Restructuring Plan. The owner must distribute and publish, in an appropriate publication, a notice to potential purchasers that describes the property, proposed terms of sale, and procedures for submitting a purchase offer.

              <P>(ii) If the purchaser is acting contemporaneously with the Restructuring Plan, the informational meeting must occur at the second meeting of tenants convened by the PAE to discuss the restructuring plan pursuant to § 401.500(d).</P>
              <P>(iii) A representative of the purchasing entity must attend the informational meeting to present its plans for the acquisition and improvement of the project and to respond to questions about the purchaser's plans for the property.</P>
              <P>(iv) Tenants shall have the opportunity, but are not to be required, to vote for or against the acquisition at the informational meeting.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice contents.</E> The notice must identify the place, date, and time of the informational meeting, and any subsequent meeting. Include a brief description of the purpose of the meeting and provide a narrative outlining the <PRTPAGE P="657"/>purchaser's plans for the project, including any request made to HUD for debt relief under § 401.461(b)(5) of the second and any additional mortgage.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Tenant endorsement.</E> (i) A purchaser may demonstrate that it is tenant endorsed by submitting documentation to HUD that a majority (51 percent) of the tenant heads of household have given their endorsement in writing. Such documentation may include, but is not limited to, ballots, letters of support, or petitions. The endorsement of tenants who did not attend, or vote at, the informational meeting, or any subsequent meeting, may be sought directly from each of these tenants subsequent to the meeting.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) If the purchaser has made a reasonable effort to obtain the endorsement of a majority (51 percent) of the tenants and the necessary percentage of votes was not obtained, the purchaser may seek HUD approval to obtain endorsement based on a lower percentage of endorsing tenants.</P>
              <P>(B) The purchaser must deliver notice to each tenant household that the purchaser is seeking HUD approval of a tenant endorsement based on less than 51 percent of tenant approval and provide tenants with at least 10 days from the date of the notice to submit comments to the purchaser on the approval of endorsement.</P>
              <P>(C) The purchaser and/or seller must submit, in writing, to HUD an account of the efforts taken to secure tenant endorsement, the number and percentage of tenants voting for and against endorsement, and any comments received from tenants regarding the approval of endorsement.</P>
              <P>(D) HUD will determine whether or not to approve endorsement on the basis of all the information available to HUD and will promptly notify the purchaser of HUD's determination.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">PAE subsidy layering certification required for Restructuring Plan.</E> The PAE must certify to HUD that any Restructuring Plan for which it submits a proposed Restructuring Commitment meets the requirements of either paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose of subsidy layering certification.</E> The purpose of the subsidy layering certification is to ensure that any HUD assistance provided to the owner of a project pursuant to a Restructuring Plan is no more than is necessary to permit the project to continue to house tenants with an income mix comparable to the income mix of the project before the Restructuring Plan is implemented, after taking into account other Government assistance described in section 102(b)(1) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545(b)(1)). This section does not limit a PAE from presenting for approval a Restructuring Plan that includes project reconfiguration (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> conversion of efficiency units to one-bedroom units) where necessary to meet the needs of the community, provided the conditions of § 401.452 are also met.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Relationship to section 102(d) of HUD Reform Act.</E> HUD is not required to perform a separate subsidy layering analysis under section 102(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545(d)), section 911 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 3545 note), or § 4.13 of this title for any HUD assistance that is included in the Restructuring Plan. HUD will adopt the PAE certification under this section if a HUD certification otherwise would be required under section 102(d).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification under existing HUD guidelines.</E> If the PAE has delegated authority from HUD to make section 102(d) subsidy layering certifications in accordance with section 911 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the PAE may comply with this section by using a procedure substantially similar to the procedure described in the Administrative Guidelines published on December 15, 1994 (59 FR 64748), or any subsequent procedure adopted by HUD to implement section 911.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other procedures.</E> If the PAE does not have the delegated authority described in paragraph (d) of this section, the PAE must submit to HUD for approval proposed procedures for making <PRTPAGE P="658"/>the subsidy layering certification under this section. Any procedures must conform to the procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section to the extent feasible and appropriate.</P>

The notice must establish the date, time, and place for a public meeting to be held no sooner than 20 days and no later than 40 days following the date of this notice. The public may provide written comments up to the date of the meeting.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Access to Restructuring Plan.</E> (1) The PAE must make the Restructuring Plan available to the parties identified in § 401.501 at least 20 days before the PAE submits the Restructuring Plan to HUD (subject to any Federal, State, or local laws restricting access to any information in the Plan or related documents).</P>
              <P>(2) As soon as the PAE determines that the Restructuring Plan is substantively complete and ready for submission to HUD, notice of the following must be provided:</P>

              <P>(ii) The date, time, and place of a public meeting to be held at least 10 days before the PAE submits the Plan to HUD.</P>
              <P>(3) When the PAE gives notice under this section, it must make the Plan available during normal business hours at the management office of the project, or if there is no such office, at another location specified by the PAE that is convenient to the tenants.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Meeting to discuss the Restructuring Plan.</E> After the PAE has given notice under this section and at least 10 days before the PAE submits the Plan to HUD, the PAE must conduct a public meeting to obtain comments on the substantively completed Plan. The PAE must accept written comments through the date of the meeting.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Disposition of comments.</E> The PAE must document and provide to HUD with the Restructuring Plan a summary of the disposition of all public comments.</P>

The PAE must make the completed Restructuring Plan and Restructuring Commitment available during normal business hours to the public at a place described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, subject to Federal, State, or local laws restricting access to any information in any of these documents.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 10 days after a determination that the Restructuring Plan will not move forward for any reason, HUD or the PAE shall provide notice to affected tenants that describes the reasons for the failure of the Plan to move forward and the availability of tenant-based assistance under § 401.602(c).</P>

Renewal without a Restructuring Plan will be considered sufficient if the rents after renewal would be sufficient to maintain both adequate debt service coverage on the HUD-insured or HUD-held mortgage and necessary replacement reserves to ensure the long-term physical integrity of the project, taking into account any comments received under § 401.502(c) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rent levels for projects eligible for exception rents.</E> HUD will renew the contract with rent levels at the least of:</P>

            <P>(2) Rent adjustments for projects assisted under the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program, other than projects assisted under the moderate rehabilitation single-room occupancy program, shall be determined in accordance with section 524(b)(3) of MAHRA.</P>
