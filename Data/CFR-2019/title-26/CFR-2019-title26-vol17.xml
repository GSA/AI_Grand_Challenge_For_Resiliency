      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Collection of, and liability for, employee tax; in general.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The employer shall collect from each of his employees the employee tax with respect to wages for employment performed for the employer by the employee. The employer shall make the collection by deducting or causing to be deducted the amount of the employee tax from such wages as and when paid. (For provisions relating to the time of such payment, see § 31.3121(a)-2.) The employer is required to collect the tax, notwithstanding the wages are paid in something other than money, and to pay over the tax in moey. (As to the exclusion from wages of remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for certain types of services, see § 31.3121(a)(7)-1, relating to such remuneration paid for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business or for domestic service in a private home of the employer; and § 31.3121(a)(8)-1, relating to such remuneration paid for agricultural labor.) For provisions relating to the collection of, and liability for, employee tax in respect of tips, see § 31.3102-3. For special rules relating to Additional Medicare Tax imposed under section 3101(b)(2), see § 31.3102-4.</P>
                <P>(b) The employer is permitted, but not required, to deduct amounts equivalent to employee tax from payments to an employee of cash remuneration to which the sections referred to in this paragraph (b) are applicable prior to the time that the sum of such payments equals—</P>
                <P>(1) $100 in the calendar year, for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business, to which § 31.3121(a)(7)-1 is applicable;</P>
                <P>(2) The applicable dollar threshold (as defined in section 3121(x)) in the calendar year, for domestic service in a private home of the employer, to which § 31.3121(a)(7)-1 is applicable;</P>
                <P>(3) $150 in the calendar year, for agricultural labor, to which § 31.3121(a)(8)-1(c)(1)(i) is applicable; or</P>
                <P>(4) $100 in the calendar year, for service performed as a home worker, to which § 31.3121(a)(10)-1 is applicable.</P>

                <P>(c) At such time as the sum of the cash payments in the calendar year for a type of service referred to in paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section equals or exceeds the amount specified, the employer is required to collect from the employee any amount of employee tax not previously deducted. If an employer pays cash remuneration to an employee for two or more of the types of service referred to in paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section, the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and this paragraph (c) are to be applied separately to the amount of remuneration attributable to each type of service. For provisions relating to the repayment to an employee, or other disposition, of amounts deducted from an employee's remuneration in excess of the correct amount of employee tax, <E T="03">see</E> § 31.6413(a)-1.</P>

                <P>(d) In collecting employee tax, the employer shall disregard any fractional part of a cent of such tax unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to 1 cent. The employer is liable for the employee tax with respect to all wages paid by him to each of his employees whether or not it is collected from the employee. If, for example, the employer deducts less than the correct amount of tax, or if he fails to deduct any part of the tax, he is nevertheless liable for the correct amount of the tax. Until collected from him the employee also is liable for the employee <PRTPAGE P="17"/>tax with respect to all the wages received by him. Any employee tax collected by or on behalf of an employer is a special fund in trust for the United States. See section 7501. The employer is indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any payment of such tax made by the employer to the district director.</P>
                <P>(e)(1) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section apply to any payment made on or after January 1, 1955.</P>

                <P>(2) The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that apply to any payment made for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business or for service performed as a home worker within the meaning of section 3121(d)(3)(C) apply to any such payment made on or after January 1, 1978. The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that apply to any payment made for domestic service in a private home of the employer apply to any such payment made on or after January 1, 1994. The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that apply to any payment made for agricultural labor apply to any such payment made on or after January 1, 1988. For rules applicable to any payment for these services made prior to the dates set forth in this paragraph (e)(2), <E T="03">see</E> § 31.3102-1 in effect at such time (<E T="03">see</E> 26 CFR part 31 contained in the edition of 26 CFR Parts 30 to 39, revised as of April 1, 2006).</P>

                <P>(iii) Deduct from any payment of such employee's wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer, or from funds referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount of tax withheld on the estimated basis to conform to the amount of employee tax imposed upon, and required to be deducted in respect of, tips reported by the employee to the employer during the calendar quarter in written statements furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a). If an adjustment is required, the additional employee tax required to be collected may be deducted upon any payment of the employee's wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer during the quarter and within the first 30 days following the quarter or from funds turned over by the employee to the employer for such purposes within such period. For provisions relating to the repayment to an employee, or other disposition, of amounts deducted from an employee's remuneration in excess of the correct <PRTPAGE P="19"/>amount of employee tax, see § 31.6413(a)-1.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Collection of tax from employee.</E> An employer is required to collect from each of its employees the tax imposed by section 3101(b)(2) (Additional Medicare Tax) with respect to wages for employment performed for the employer by the employee only to the extent the employer pays wages to the employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. This rule applies regardless of the employee's filing status or other income. Thus, the employer disregards any amount of wages or Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) compensation paid to the employee's spouse. The employer also disregards any RRTA compensation paid by the employer to the employee or any wages or RRTA compensation paid to the employee by another employer.

The employer will not be relieved of its liability for payment of the tax required to be withheld unless it can show that the tax under section 3101(b)(2) has been paid.

                <P>Section 3112 makes ineffectual as to the employer tax imposed by section 3111 those provisions of law which grant to an instrumentality of the United States an exemption from taxation, unless such provisions grant a specific exemption from the tax imposed by section 3111 by an express reference to such section or the corresponding section of prior law (section 1410 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Thus, the general exemptions from Federal taxation granted by various statutes to certain instrumentalities of the United States without specific reference to the tax imposed by <PRTPAGE P="21"/>section 3111 or by section 1410 of the 1939 Code are rendered inoperative insofar as such exemptions relate to the tax imposed by section 3111. For provisions relating to the exception from employment of services performed in the employ of an instrumentality of the United States specifically exempted from the employer tax, see § 31.3121(b)(5)-1. For provisions relating to services performed for an instrumentality exempt on December 31, 1950, from the employer tax, see paragraph (c) of § 31.3121 (b) (6)-1.</P>

                <P>(a)(1) Whether remuneration paid after 1954 for employment performed after 1936 constitutes wages is determined under section 3121(a). This section and §§ 31.3121(a)(1)-1 to 31.3121(a)(15)-1, inclusive (relating to the statutory exclusions from wages), apply with respect only to remuneration paid after 1954 for employment performed after 1936. Whether remuneration paid after 1936 and before 1940 for employment performed after 1936 constitutes wages shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 401 (Regulations 91). Whether remuneration paid after 1939 and before 1951 for employment performed after 1936 constitutes wages shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 402 (Regulations 106). Whether remuneration paid after 1950 and before 1955 for employment performed after 1936 constitutes wages shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 408 (Regulations 128).</P>
                <P>(2) The term <E T="03">compensation</E> as used in section 3231(e) of the Internal Revenue Code has the same meaning as the term <E T="03">wages</E> as used in this section, determined without regard to section 3121(b)(9), except as specifically limited by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (chapter 22 of the Internal Revenue Code) or regulation. The Commissioner may provide any additional guidance that may be necessary or appropriate in applying the definitions of sections 3121(a) and 3231(e).</P>
                <P>(b) The term “wages” means all remuneration for employment unless specifically excepted under section 3121(a) (see §§ 31.3121(a)(1)-1 to 31.3121(a)(15)-1, inclusive) or paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) The name by which the remuneration for employment is designated is immaterial. Thus, salaries, fees, bonuses, and commissions on sales or on insurance premiums, are wages if paid as compensation for employment.</P>
                <P>(d) Generally the basis upon which the remuneration is paid is immaterial in determining whether the remuneration constitutes wages. Thus, it may be paid on the basis of piecework, or a percentage of profits; and it may be paid hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. See, however, § 31.3121(a)(8)-1 which relates to the treatment of cash remuneration computed on a time basis for agricultural labor.</P>
                <P>(e) Generally the medium in which the remuneration is paid is also immaterial. It may be paid in cash or in something other than cash, as for example, goods, lodging, food, or clothing. Remuneration paid in items other than cash shall be computed on the basis of the fair value of such items at the time of payment. See, however, §§ 31.3121 (a)(7)-1, 31.3121(a)(8)-1, 31.3121(a)(10)-1, and 31.3121(a)(12)-1, relating to the treatment of remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business and for domestic service in a private home of the employer, for agricultural labor, for services performed by certain homeworkers, and as tips, respectively.</P>

                <P>(f) Ordinarily, facilities or privileges (such as entertainment, medical services, or so-called “courtesy” discounts on purchases), furnished or offered by an employer to his employees generally, are not considered as remuneration for employment if such facilities or privileges are of relatively small value and are offered or furnished by the employer merely as a means of promoting the health, good will, contentment, or efficiency of his employees. The term “facilities or privileges”, however, does not ordinarily include the value of meals or lodging furnished, <PRTPAGE P="22"/>for example, to restaurant or hotel employees, or to seamen or other employees aboard vessels, since generally these items constitute an appreciable part of the total remuneration of such employees.</P>
                <P>(g) Amounts of so-called “vacation allowances” paid to an employee constitute wages. Thus, the salary of an employee on vacation, paid notwithstanding his absence from work, constitutes wages.</P>
                <P>(h) Amounts paid specifically—either as advances or reimbursements—for traveling or other bona fide ordinary and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer are not wages. Traveling and other reimbursed expenses must be identified either by making a separate payment or by specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and expense allowances are combined in a single payment. For amounts that are received by an employee on or after July 1, 1990, with respect to expenses paid or incurred on or after July 1, 1990, see § 31.3121(a)-3.</P>

                <P>(i) Remuneration for employment, unless such remuneration is specifically excepted under section 3121(a) or paragraph (j) of this section, constitutes wages even though at the time paid the relationship of employer and employee no longer exists between the person in whose employ the services were performed and the individual who performed them.

                <SUBJECT>Wages; when paid and received.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) In general, wages are received by an employee at the time that they are paid by the employer to the employee. Wages are paid by an employer at the time that they are actually or constructively paid unless under paragraph (c) of this section they are <PRTPAGE P="23"/>deemed to be subsequently paid. For provisions relating to the time when tips received by an employee are deemed paid to the employee, see § 31.3121(q)-1.</P>
                <P>(b) Wages are constructively paid when they are credited to the account of or set apart for an employee so that they may be drawn upon by him at any time although not then actually reduced to possession. To constitute payment in such a case the wages must be credited to or set apart for the employee without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and must be made available to him so that they may be drawn upon at any time, and their payment brought within his own control and disposition. For provisions relating to the treatment of deductions from remuneration as payments of remuneration, see § 31.3123-1.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) The first $100 of cash remuneration paid, either actually or constructively, by an employer in any calendar year to an employee for—</P>
                <P>(i) Service not in the course of the employer's trade or business, to which § 31.3121(a)(7)-1 is applicable, shall be deemed to be paid by the employer to the employee at the first moment of time in such calendar year that the sum of such cash payments made within such year is at least $100; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Service performed as a home worker within the meaning of section 3121(d)(3)(C), to which § 31.3121(a)(10)-1 is applicable, shall be deemed to be paid by the employer to the employee at the first moment of time in such calendar year that the sum of such cash payments made within such year is at least $100.</P>
                <P>(2) Cash remuneration paid, either actually or constructively, by an employer in any calendar year to an employee for domestic service in a private home of the employer to which § 31.3121(a)(7)-1 is applicable, and before the sum of the payments of such cash remuneration equals or exceeds the applicable dollar threshold (as defined in section 3121(x)) for such year, shall be deemed to be paid by the employer to the employee at the first moment of time in such calendar year that the sum of such cash payments made within such year equals or exceeds the applicable dollar threshold (as defined in section 3121(x)) for such year.</P>
                <P>(3) Cash remuneration paid, either actually or constructively, by an employer in any calendar year to an employee for agricultural labor to which § 31.3121(a)(8)-1 is applicable, and before either of the events described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section has occurred, shall be deemed to be paid by the employer to the employee at the first moment of time in such calendar year that—</P>
                <P>(i) The sum of the payments of such remuneration is $150 or more; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The employer's expenditures for agricultural labor in such calendar year equals or exceeds $2,500, except that this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) shall not apply in determining when such remuneration is deemed to be paid under this paragraph if such employee—</P>
                <P>(A) Is employed as a hand-harvest laborer and is paid on a piece rate basis in an operation which has been, and is customarily and generally recognized as having been, paid on a piece rate basis in the region of employment;</P>
                <P>(B) Commutes daily from his permanent residence to the farm on which he is so employed; and</P>
                <P>(C) Has been employed in agriculture less than 13 weeks during the preceding calendar year.</P>
                <P>(4) If an employer pays cash remuneration to an employee for two or more of the types of service referred to in this paragraph, the provisions of this paragraph are to be applied separately to the amount of remuneration attributable to each type of service.</P>
                <P>(d)(1) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to any payment of wages made on or after January 1, 1955.</P>

                <P>(2) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section that apply to any payment of wages made for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business or for service performed as a home worker within the meaning of section 3121(d)(3)(C) apply to any such payment made on or after January 1, 1978. The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section that apply to any payment of wages made for domestic service in a private home of the employer apply to any such payment made on or after <PRTPAGE P="24"/>January 1, 1994. The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section that apply to any payment of wages made for agricultural labor apply to any such payment made on or after January 1, 1988.

                <SUBJECT>Reimbursement and other expense allowance amounts.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">When excluded from wages.</E> If a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement meets the requirements of section 62(c) of the Code and § 1.62-2 and the expenses are substantiated within a reasonable period of time, payments made under the arrangement that do not exceed the substantiated expenses are treated as paid under an accountable plan and are not wages. In addition, if both wages and the reimbursement or other expense allowance are combined in a single payment, the reimbursement or other expense allowance must be identified either by making a separate payment or by specifically identifying the amount of the reimbursement or other expense allowance.</P>

                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Per diem or mileage allowances.</E> If a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement providing a per diem or mileage allowance satisfies the requirements of section 62(c) and § 1.62-2, but the allowance is paid at a rate for each day or mile of travel that exceeds the amount of the employee's expenses deemed substantiated for a day or mile of travel, the excess portion is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan and is included in wages. In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as a reimbursement, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes when paid. In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as an advance, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes no later than the first payroll period following the payroll period in which the expenses with respect to which the advance was paid (i.e., the days or miles of travel) are substantiated. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe special rules in pronouncements of general applicability regarding the timing of withholding and payment of employment taxes on per diem and mileage allowances.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) The term “wages” does not include that part of the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee within any calendar year—</P>

For provisions relating to the treatment of tips for purposes of the annual wage limitation see § 31.3121(q)-1.</FP>

                <P>(2) The annual wage limitation applies only if the remuneration received during any 1 calendar year by an employee from the same employer for employment performed after 1936 exceeds the amount of such limitation. The limitation in such case relates to the amount of remuneration received during any 1 calendar year for employment after 1936 and not to the amount of remuneration for employment performed in any 1 calendar year.

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>Employee A, in 1967 receives $7,000 from employer B in part payment of $8,000 due him from employment performed in 1967. In 1968 A receives from employer B the balance of $1,000 due him for employment performed in 1967, and thereafter in 1968 also receives $7,000 for employment performed in 1968 for employer B. The first $6,600 of the $7,000 received during 1967 is subject to the taxes in 1967. The remaining $400 received in 1967 is not included as wages and is not subject to the taxes. The balance of $1,000 received in 1968 for employment during 1967 is subject to the taxes during 1968 as is also the first $6,800 of the $7,000 thereafter received in 1968 ($1,000 plus $6,800 totaling $7,800, which is the annual wage limitation applicable to remuneration received in 1968 by an employee from any one employer). The remaining $200 received in 1968 is not included as wages and is not subject to the taxes.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                

                <P>(3) If during a calendar year the employee receives remuneration from more than one employer, the annual wage limitation does not apply to the aggregate remuneration received from all of such employers, but instead applies to the remuneration received during such calendar year from each employer with respect to employment after 1936. In such case the first remuneration received in any calendar year after 1974 up to the amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) (the first $13,200 received in 1974, the first $10,800 received in 1973, the first $9,000 received in 1972, the first $7,800 received in any calendar year after 1967 and before 1972, the first $6,600 received in any calendar year after 1965 and before 1968, the first $4,800 received in any calendar year after 1958 and before 1966, or the first $4,200 received in any calendar year after 1954 and before 1959) from each employer constitutes wages and is subject to the taxes, even though, under section 6413(c), the employee may be entitled to a special credit or refund of a portion of the employee tax deducted from his wages received during the calendar year. In this connection and in connection with the two examples immediately following, see § 31.6413(c)-1, relating to special credits or refunds of employee tax. In connection with the annual wage limitation in the case of remuneration paid for services performed in the employ of the United States or a wholly owned instrumentality thereof, see § 31.3122. In connection with the annual wage limitation in the case of remuneration paid for <PRTPAGE P="26"/>services performed in the employ of the Government of Guam, the Government of American Samoa, the District of Columbia, a political subdivision of the Government of Guam, or the Government of American Samoa, or any instrumentality of any of the foregoing which is wholly owned thereby, see § 31.3125. In connection with the application of the annual wage limitation, see also paragraph (b) of this section, relating to the circumstances under which wages paid by a predecessor employer are deemed to be paid by his successor.

Thus, if a charitable or religious organization, subject to the taxes by virtue of its certificate, acquires all the property of another such organization likewise subject to the taxes and retains the services of employees of the predecessor, wages paid to such employees by the predecessor in the year of the acquisition (and prior to such acquisition) will be attributed to the successor for purposes of the annual wage limitation.</P>

                  <P>A local government employee is injured while performing work-related activities. The employee is not covered by the State workers' compensation law, but is covered by a local government ordinance that requires the local government to pay the employee's full salary when the employee is out of work as a result of an injury incurred while performing services for the local government. The ordinance does not limit or otherwise affect the local government's liability to the employee for the work-related injury. The local ordinance is not a workers' compensation law, but it is in the nature of a workers' compensation act. Therefore, the salary the employee receives while out of work as a result of the work-related injury is excluded from wages under section 3121(a)(2)(A).</P>

                  <P>The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 1</E> except that the local ordinance requires the employer to continue to pay the employee's full salary while the employee is unable to work due to an injury whether or not the injury is work-related. Thus, the local ordinance does not limit benefits to instances of work-related disability. A benefit paid under an ordinance that does not limit benefits to instances of work-related injuries is not a statute in the nature of a workers' compensation act. Therefore, the salary the injured employee receives from the employer while out of work is wages subject to FICA even though the employee's injury is work-related.</P>

                  <P>The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 1</E> except that the local ordinance includes a rebuttable presumption that certain injuries, including any heart attack incurred by a firefighter or other law enforcement personnel is work-related. The presumption in the ordinance does not eliminate the requirement that the injury be work-related in order to entitle the injured worker to full salary. Therefore, the ordinance is a statute in the nature of a workers' compensation act, and the salary the injured employee receives pursuant to the ordinance is excluded from wages under section 3121(a)(2)(A).</P>

                <P>The term “wages” does not include any payment by an employer (without deduction from the remuneration of, or other reimbursement from, the employee) of either (a) the employee tax imposed by section 3101 or the corresponding section of prior law, or (b) any payment required from an employee under a State unemployment compensation law.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Meaning of terms</E>—(1) <E T="03">Services not in the course of employer's trade or business.</E> The term “services not in the course of the employer's trade or business” includes services that do not promote or advance the trade or business of the employer. Such term does not include services performed for a corporation. As used in this section, the term does not include service not in the course of the employer's trade or business performed on a farm operated for profit or domestic service in a private home of the employer. See paragraph (f) of § 31.3121(g)-1 for provisions relating to services not in the course of the employer's trade or business performed on a farm operated for profit.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Domestic service in a private home of the employer.</E> Services of a household nature performed by an employee in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed constitute domestic service in a private home of the employer. A private home is a fixed place of abode of an individual or family. A separate and distinct dwelling unit maintained by an individual in an apartment house, hotel, or other similar establishment may constitute a private home. If a dwelling house is used primarily as a boarding or lodging house for the purpose of supplying board or lodging to the public as a business enterprise, it is not a private home. In general, services of a household nature in or about a private home include services performed by cooks, waiters, butlers, housekeepers, governesses, maids, valets, baby sitters, janitors, laundresses, furnacemen, caretakers, handymen, gardeners, footmen, grooms, and chauffeurs of automobiles for family use. The term “domestic service in a private home of the employer” does not include the services enumerated above unless such services are performed in or about a private home of the employer. Services not of a household nature, such as services performed as a private secretary, tutor, or librarian, even though performed in the employer's home, are not included within the term “domestic service in a private home of the employer”. As used in this section, the term does not include domestic service in a private home of the employer performed on a farm operated for profit or service not in the course of the employer's trade or business. See paragraph (f) § 31.3121(g)-1 for provisions relating to domestic service in a private home of the employer performed on a farm operated for profit.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Payments other than in cash.</E> The term “wages” does not include remuneration paid in any medium other than cash (1) for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business, or (2) for domestic service in a private home of the employer. Cash remuneration includes checks and other monetary media of exchange. Remuneration paid in any medium other than cash, such as lodging, food, clothing, car tokens, transportation passes or tickets, or other goods or commodities, for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business or for domestic service in a private home of the employer does not constitute wages.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Cash payments.</E> (1) The term <E T="03">wages</E> does not include cash remuneration <PRTPAGE P="31"/>paid by an employer in any calendar year to an employee for—</P>
                <P>(i) Domestic service in a private home of the employer, unless the cash remuneration paid in such year by the employer to the employee for such service equals or exceeds the applicable dollar threshold (as defined in section 3121(x)) for such year; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Service not in the course of the employer's trade or business, unless the cash remuneration paid in such year by the employer to the employee for such service equals or exceeds $100.</P>

                <P>(2) The tests relating to cash remuneration are based on the remuneration paid in a calendar year rather than on the remuneration earned during a calendar year. The following example illustrates this provision:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>On March 31, 2004, employer X pays employee A cash remuneration of $100 for service not in the course of X's trade or business. Such remuneration constitutes wages subject to the taxes even though $10 thereof represents payment for such service performed by A for X in December 2003.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(3) In determining whether wages have been paid either for domestic service in a private home of the employer or for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business, only cash remuneration for such service shall be taken into account. Cash remuneration includes checks and other monetary media of exchange. Remuneration paid in any other medium, such as lodging, food, clothing, car tokens, transportation passes or tickets, or other goods or commodities, is disregarded in determining whether the cash-remuneration test is met. If an employee receives cash remuneration from an employer in a calendar year for both types of services the pertinent cash-remuneration test is to be applied separately to each type of service. If an employee receives cash remuneration from more than one employer in a calendar year for domestic service in a private home of the employer or for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business, the pertinent cash-remuneration test is to be applied separately to the remuneration received from each employer.</P>

                <P>(ii) The employer's expenditures for agricultural labor in such year equal or <PRTPAGE P="32"/>exceed $2,500, except that this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) shall not apply in determining whether remuneration paid to an employee constitutes wages for agricultural labor if such employee—</P>
                <P>(A) Is employed as a hand-harvest laborer and is paid on a piece rate basis in an operation which has been, and is customarily and generally recognized as having been, paid on a piece rate basis in the region of employment;</P>

                <P>(C) Has been employed in agriculture less than 13 weeks during the preceding calendar year.</P>

                <P>(2) The application of the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>Employer X pays A $140 in cash for agricultural labor in calendar year 2004. X makes no other payments to A during the year and makes no other payment for agricultural labor to any other employee. Employee A is not employed as a hand-harvest laborer. Neither the $150-cash-remuneration test nor the $2,500-employer's-expenditures-for-agricultural-labor test is met. Accordingly, the remuneration paid by X to A is not subject to the taxes. If in 2004 X had paid A $140 in cash for agricultural labor and had made expenditures of $2,360 or more to other employees for agricultural labor, the $140 paid by X to A would have been subject to tax because the $2,500-employer's-expenditures-for-agricultural-labor test would have been met. Or, if X had paid A $150 in cash in 2004 and made no other payments to any other employee for agricultural labor, the $150 paid by X to A would have been subject to tax because the $150-cash-remuneration test would have been met.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of cash-remuneration test.</E> (1) If an employee receives cash remuneration from an employer both for services which constitute agricultural labor and for services which do not constitute agricultural labor, only the amount of such remuneration which is attributable to agricultural labor shall be included in determining whether cash remuneration of $150 or more has been paid in the calendar year by the employer to the employee for agricultural labor. The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(1):
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>Employer X operates a store and also is engaged in farming operations. Employee A, who regularly performs services for X in connection with the operation of the store, works on X's farm when additional help is required for the farm activities. In the calendar year 2004, X pays A $140 in cash for services performed in agricultural labor, and $4,000 for services performed in connection with the operation of the store. X has no additional expenditures for agricultural labor in 2004. Since the cash remuneration paid by X to A in the calendar year 2004 for agricultural labor is less than $150, the $150-cash-remuneration test is not met. The $140 paid by X to A in 2004 for agricultural labor does not constitute wages and is not subject to the taxes.</P>

                <P>(2) The test relating to cash remuneration of $150 or more is based on the cash remuneration paid in a calendar year rather than on the remuneration earned during a calendar year. It is immaterial if such cash remuneration is paid in a calendar year other than the year in which the agricultural labor is performed. The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(2):

X has no additional expenditures for agricultural labor in 2004. Since X's expenditures for agricultural labor in 2004 are less than $2,500, the employer's-expenditures-for-agricultural-labor test is not met.

                <P>(2) The test relating to an employer's expenditures of $2,500 or more for agricultural labor is based on the expenditures paid by the employer in a calendar year rather than on the expenses incurred by the employer during a calendar year. It is immaterial if the expenditures are paid in a calendar year other than the year in which the agricultural labor is performed. The following example illustrates this paragraph (e)(2):

                  <P>Employer X employs A to construct fences on a farm owned by X. The work constitutes agricultural labor and is performed over the course of November and December 2003. A is not employed by X at any other time, however X does have other employees to whom X pays remuneration of $2,000 for agricultural labor in 2003. X pays A $140 in cash in November 2003 and $140 in cash in January 2004, in full payment for the work. The $140 payment to A made in November is not wages for calendar year 2003 because the $150-cash-remuneration test is not met and X's total expenditures for agricultural labor for such year are not equal to or in excess of $2,500. The $140 payment to A made in January is not wages for 2004 because the $150 cash-remuneration test is not met. However, if X pays additional remuneration to employees for agricultural labor in 2004 that equals or exceeds $2,360, the employer's-expenditures-for-agricultural-labor test will be met and the $140 paid by X to A in 2004 will be considered wages. It is immaterial that the work was performed in 2003.</P>

The reasonable belief contemplated by the statute may be based upon any evidence reasonably sufficient to induce such belief, even though such evidence may be insufficient upon closer examination by the district director or the courts finally to establish that a deduction is allowable under section 217. The reasonable belief shall be based upon the application of section 217 and the regulations thereunder in Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). When used in this section, the term “moving expenses” has the same meaning as when used in section 217 and the regulations thereunder.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “wages” does not include the amount of any payment or series of payments made after January 2, 1968, by an employer to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents under a plan established by the employer which makes provisions for his employees generally (or for his employees generally and their dependents) or for a class or classes of his employees (or for a class or classes of his employees and their dependents), which is paid or commences to be paid upon or within a reasonable time after the termination of an employee's employment relationship because of the employee's—</P>
                <P>(1) Death,</P>
                <P>(2) Retirement for disability, or</P>
                <P>(3) Retirement after attaining an age specified in the plan established by the employer or in a pension plan of the employer at the age at which a person in the employee's circumstances is eligible for retirement.</P>
                <FP>A payment or series of payments made under the circumstances described in the preceding sentence is excluded from “wages” even if made pursuant to an incentive compensation plan which also provides for the making of other types of payments. However, any payment or series of payments which would have been paid if the employee's relationship had not been terminated is not excluded from “wages” under this section and section 3121(a)(13). For example, lump-sum payments for unused vacation time or a final paycheck received after retirement are payments which the employee would have received whether or not he retired and therefore are not excluded from “wages” under this section. Further, if any payment is made upon or after termination of employment for any reason other than those set out in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph such payment is not excludable from “wages” by this section. For example, if a pension plan provides for retirement upon disability, completion of 30 years of service, or attainment of age 65, and if an employee who is not disabled retires at age 61 after 30 years of service, none of the retirement payments made to the employee under the pension plan (including any made after he is 65) is excludable from “wages” under this section. However, if the pension plan had conditioned retirement after 30 years of service upon attainment of age 60, all of the retirement payments would have been excludable.</FP>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Plan.</E> The plan or system established by an employer need not provide for payments because of termination of employment for all the reasons set out in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, but such plan or system may provide for payments because of termination for any one or more of such reasons. Payments because of termination of employment for any one or more of such reasons under a plan or system established by an employer solely for the dependents of his employees are not within this exclusion from wages.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Dependents.</E> Dependents of an employee include the employee's husband or wife, children, and any other members of the employee's immediate family.<PRTPAGE P="36"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Benefit payment.</E> It is immaterial for purposes of this exclusion whether the amount or possibility of benefit payments is paid on account of services rendered or taken into consideration in fixing the amount of an employee's remuneration or whether such payments are required, expressly or impliedly, by the contract of service.</P>

On March 5, 1973, A receives $5,500 from his employer of which $1,500 represents A's salary for services he performed in February 1973, and $4,000 represents incentive compensation paid under the employer's plan.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Services performed within the United States.</E> Services performed after 1954 within the United States (see § 31.3121(e)-1) by an employee for his employer, unless specifically excepted by section 3121(b), constitute employment. With respect to services performed within the United States, the place where the contract of service is entered into is immaterial. The citizenship or residence of the employee or of the employer also is immaterial except to the extent provided in any specific exception from employment. Thus, the employee and the employer may be citizens and residents of a foreign country and the contract of service may be entered into in a foreign country, and yet, if the employee under such contract performs services within the United States, there may be to that extent employment.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Services performed outside the United States</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, services performed outside <PRTPAGE P="38"/>the United States (see § 31.3121(e)-1) do not constitute employment.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">On or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft.</E> (i) Services performed after 1954 by an employee for an employer “on or in connection with” an American vessel or American aircraft outside the United States (see § 31.3121(e)-1) constitute employment if:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The employee is also employed “on and in connection with” such vessel or aircraft when outside the United States; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The services are performed under a contract of service, between the employee and the employer, which is entered into within the United States, or during the performance of the contract under which the services are performed and while the employee is employed on the vessel or aircraft it touches at a port within the United States; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) The services are not excepted under section 3121(b).</P>
                <P>(ii) An employee performs services on and in connection with the vessel or aircraft if he performs services on such vessel or aircraft which are also in connection with the vessel or aircraft. Services performed on the vessel by employees as officers or members of the crew, or as employees of concessionaires, of the vessel, for example, are performed under such circumstances, since such services are also connected with the vessel. Similarly, services performed on the aircraft by employees as officers or members of the crew of the aircraft are performed on and in connection with such aircraft. Services may be performed on the vessel or aircraft, however, which have no connection with it, as in the case of services performed by an employee while on the vessel or aircraft merely as a passenger in the general sense. For example, the services of a buyer in the employ of a department store while he is a passenger on a vessel are not in connection with the vessel.</P>

                <P>(iii) If services are performed by an employee “on and in connection with” an American vessel or American aircraft when outside the United States and the conditions listed in paragraph (c)(2)(i) (<E T="03">b</E>) and (<E T="03">c</E>) of this section are met, then the services of that employee performed on or in connection with the vessel or aircraft constitute employment. The expression “on or in connection with” refers not only to services performed on the vessel or aircraft but also to services connected with the vessel or aircraft which are not actually performed on it (for example, shore services performed as officers or members of the crew, or as employees of concessionaires, of the vessel).</P>
                <P>(iv) Services performed by a member of the crew or other employee whose contract of service is not entered into within the United States, and during the performance of which and while the employee is employed on the vessel or aircraft it does not touch at a port within the United States, do not constitute employment under this subparagraph, notwithstanding services performed by other members of the crew or other employees on or in connection with the vessel or aircraft may constitute employment.</P>
                <P>(v) A vessel includes every description of watercraft, or other contrivance, used as a means of transportation on water. An aircraft includes every description of craft, or other contrivance, used as a means of transportation through the air. In the case of an aircraft, the term “port” means an airport. An airport means an area on land or water used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo. For definitions of “American vessel” and “American aircraft”, see § 31.3121(f)-1.</P>
                <P>(vi) With respect to services performed outside the United States on or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft, the citizenship or residence of the employee is immaterial, and the citizenship or residence of the employer is material only in case it has a bearing in determining whether a vessel is an American vessel.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">By a citizen of the United States as an employee for an American employer.</E> Services performed after 1954 outside the United States by a citizen of the United States as an employee for an American employer constitute employment provided the services are not specifically excepted under section 3121(b). For definitions of “citizen of the <PRTPAGE P="39"/>United States” and “American employer”, see §§ 31.3121(e)-1 and 3121 (h)-1, respectively.</P>

                <P>(a) Services performed by an employee for an employer do not constitute employment for purposes of the taxes if they are specifically excepted from employment under any of the numbered paragraphs of section 3121(b). Services so excepted do not constitute employment for purposes of the taxes even though they are performed within the United States, or are performed outside the United States on or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft, or are performed outside the United States by a citizen of the United States for an American employer.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Services of workers from Mexico.</E> Services performed before 1965 by foreign agricultural workers from the Republic of Mexico under contracts entered into in accordance with title V of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, are excepted from employment. Contracts entered into pursuant to the provisions of such title V may provide for the performance only of services which constitute “agricultural employment”. The term “agricultural employment” includes certain services which do not constitute “agricultural labor” as that term is defined in section 3121(g) (see § 31.3121(g)-1. For purposes of title V of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, the term “agricultural employment” includes services or activities included within the provisions of section 3(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, or section 3121(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under section 507 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, and as in effect before October 3, 1961, the term “agricultural employment” included also horticultural employment, cotton ginning, compressing and storing, crushing of oil seeds, and the packing, canning, freezing, drying, or other processing of perishable or seasonable agricultural products.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Services of workers from British West Indies.</E> Services performed by a foreign agricultural worker lawfully admitted to the United States from the <PRTPAGE P="40"/>Bahamas, Jamaica, or the other British West Indies, on a temporary basis to perform form agricultural labor are excepted from employment.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Services performed after 1956 by foreign workers.</E> Services performed after 1956 by a foreign agricultural worker lawfully admitted to the United States from any foreign country or possession thereof, including the Republic of Mexico, on a temporary basis to perform agricultural labor are excepted from employment.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Services performed before 1959 in connection with the production or harvesting of certain oleoresinous products.</E> Services performed before 1959 in connection with the production or harvesting of crude gum (oleoresin) from a living tree or the processing of such crude gum into gum spirits of turpentine and gum rosin, provided the processing is carried on by the original producer of the crude gum, are expected from employment. However, the services to which this paragraph relates constitute agricultural labor as defined in section 3121(g) (see paragraph (d) of § 31.3121(g)-1). Thus, any cash remuneration paid for such services, to the extent that the services are deemed to constitute employment by reason of the rules relating to included and excluded services continued in section 3121(c) (see § 31.3121(c)-1), is taken into account in applying the test prescribed in section 3121(a)(8)(B) for determining whether cash remuneration paid for agricultural labor constitutes wages (see paragraph (c) of § 31.3121(a)(8)-1).</P>

For purposes of this exception, the statutory tests are the type of services performed by the employee, the character of the place where the services are performed, and the status of the employee as a student enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school, college, or university.</P>
                <P>(b) In general, services of a household nature in or about the club rooms or house of a local college club or local chapter of a college fraternity or sorority include services rendered by cooks, waiters, butlers, maids, janitors, laundresses, furnacemen, handymen, gardeners, housekeepers, and housemothers.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Family employment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Certain services are excepted from employment because of the existence of a family relationship between the employee and the individual employing him. The exceptions are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Services performed by an individual in the employ of his or her spouse;</P>
                <P>(2) (i) Services performed before 1961 by a father or mother in the employ of his or her son or daughter;</P>
                <P>(ii) Services not in the course of the employer's trade or business, or domestic service in a private home of the employer, performed after 1960 but prior to 1968 by a father or mother in the employ of his or her son or daughter;</P>

                <P>(iii) Services not in the course of the employer's trade or business, or domestic service in a private home of the employer, performed after 1967 by a father or mother in the employ of his or her son or daughter unless (<E T="03">a</E>) the employer has a child (including an adopted child or stepchild) living in his or her home who is under age 18 or who has a mental or physical condition which requires the personal care and supervision of an adult for at least 4 continuous weeks in the calendar quarter in which the services are rendered; and (<E T="03">b</E>) the employer is during the calendar quarter in which the services are rendered:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A widow or widower;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A divorced person who has not remarried; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A married person who has a spouse living in the home who has a mental or physical condition which results in such spouse's being incapable of caring for such child for at least 4 continuous weeks in the calendar quarter in which the services are rendered; and</P>
                <P>(3) Services performed by a son or daughter under the age of 21 in the employ of his or her father or mother.</P>
                <P>(b) Under paragraph (a) (1) and (2) (i) of this section, the exception is conditioned solely upon the family relationship between the employee and the individual employing him. Under paragraph (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, in addition to the family relationship, there is a further requirement that the services performed after 1960 and before 1968 for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) and after 1967 for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) shall be services not in the course of the employer's trade or business or shall be domestic service in a private home of the employer. The terms “services not in the course of the employer's trade or business” and “domestic service in a private home of the employer” have the same meaning as when used in § 31.3121(a) (7)-1, except that it is immaterial under paragraphs (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section whether or not such services are performed on a farm operated for profit. The mere fact that a mental or physical disability, whether temporary or permanent, renders a child or spouse incapable of self-support does not necessarily mean that the child requires the personal care and supervision of an adult or that the spouse is incapable of caring for a child within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. A written statement by a doctor of the existence of the mental or physical condition of the child or spouse which states that the child requires the personal care and supervision of an adult or that the spouse is incapable of caring for a child and which sets forth the period of time during which the condition has existed and is likely to exist will usually be sufficient evidence to establish the existence and duration of the condition at the time of the statement. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, in addition to the family relationship, there is a further requirement that the son or daughter shall be under the age of 21, and the exception continues only during the time that the son or daughter is under the age of 21.</P>
                <P>(c) Services performed in the employ of a partnership are within the exception described in paragraph (a) of this section only if the requisite family relationship exists between the employee and each of the partners comprising the partnership.</P>

                <P>(d) Services performed in the employ of a corporation are not within the exception described in paragraph (a) of this section, except that services performed in the employ of an entity that is treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv)(B) of this chapter <PRTPAGE P="42"/>may qualify for the exception if the requirements of the exception are otherwise met. An entity that is treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv)(B) of this chapter is not treated as the employer for purposes of applying section 3121(b)(3) and this section. For purposes of applying section 3121(b)(3) and this section, the owner of an entity that is treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv)(B) of this chapter is treated as the employer.</P>
                <P>(e) Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to wages paid on or after November 1, 2011. However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to wages paid on or after January 1, 2009.</P>

Services performed outside the United States on or in connection with a vessel not an American vessel or on or in connection with an aircraft not an American aircraft, either by an employee who is not a citizen of the United States or for an employer who is not an American employer, do not, in any event, constitute employment.

For provisions relating generally to the application of the taxes in the case of services performed in the employ of the United States or a wholly owned instrumentality thereof, see 3122. For provisions relating to the computation of remuneration for service performed by an individual as a member of a uniformed service or for service performed by an individual as a volunteer or volunteer leader within the meaning of the Peace Corps Act, see § 31.3121(i)-2 and § 31.3121(i)-3, respectively.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Services covered under a retirement system established by a law of the United States.</E> Services performed in the employ of the United States or in the employ of any instrumentality thereof are excepted from employment under section 3121(b)(6)(A) if such services are covered under a law enacted by the Congress of the United States which <PRTPAGE P="44"/>specifically provides for the establishment of a retirement system for employees of the United States or of such instrumentality. Determinations as to whether services are covered by a retirement system of the requisite character are to be made as of the time such services are performed. Services of an employee who has an option to have his services covered under a retirement system are not covered under such retirement system unless and until he exercises such option. The test is whether particular services performed by an employee are covered by a retirement system of the requisite character rather than whether the position in which such services are performed is covered by such retirement system.</P>

                <P>(3) Determinations as to whether services performed in the employ of an instrumentality referred to in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section are covered by a retirement system established by such instrumentality are to be made as of the time such services are performed. Services of an employee who has an option to have his services covered under a retirement system established by the instrumentality are not covered under such retirement system unless and until he exercises such option.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> Under section 3121(b)(7)(F), wages of an employee of a State or local government are generally subject to tax under FlCA after July 1, 1991, unless the employee is a member of a retirement system maintained by the State or local government entity. This section 31.3121(b)(7)-2 provides rules for determining whether an employee is a “member of a retirement system”. These rules generally treat an employee as a member of a retirement system if he or she participates in a system that provides retirement benefits, and has an accrued benefit or receives an allocation under the system that is comparable to the benefits he or she would have or receive under Social Security. In the case of part-time, seasonal and temporary employees, this minimum retirement benefit is required to be nonforfeitable.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">General rule</E>—(1) <E T="03">Inclusion in employment of service by employees who are not members of a retirement system.</E> Except in the case of service described in sections 3121(b)(7)(F) (i) through (v), the exception from employment under section 3121(b)(7) does not apply to service in the employ of a State or any political subdivision thereof, or of any instrumentality of one or more of the foregoing that is wholly owned thereby, after July 1, 1991, unless the employee is a member of a retirement system of such State, political subdivision or instrumentality at the time the service is performed. An employee is not a member of a retirement system at the time service is performed unless at that time he or she is a qualified participant (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) in a retirement system that meets the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section with respect to that employee.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Treatment of individuals employed in more than one position.</E> Under section 3121(b)(7)(F), whether an employee is a member of a retirement system is determined on an entity-by-entity rather than a position-by-position basis. Thus, if an employee is a member of a retirement system with respect to service he or she performs in one position in the employ of a State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof, the employee is generally treated as a member of a retirement system with respect to all service performed for the same State, political subdivision or instrumentality in any other positions. A State is a separate entity from its political subdivisions, and an instrumentality is a separate entity from the State or political subdivision by which it is owned for purposes of this rule. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section, however, for rules relating to service and compensation required to be taken into account in determining whether an employee is a member of a retirement system for purposes of this section. This rule is illustrated by the following examples:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>

                  <P>An individual is employed full-time by a county and is a qualified participant (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) in its retirement plan with regard to such employment. In addition to this full-time employment, the individual is employed part-time in another position with the same county. The part-time position is not covered by the county retirement plan, however, and neither the service nor the compensation in the part-time position is considered in determining the employee's retirement benefit under the county retirement plan. Nevertheless, if the retirement plan meets the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section with respect to the individual, the exclusion from employment under section 3121(b)(7) applies to both the employee's <PRTPAGE P="48"/>full-time and part-time service with the county.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>An individual is employed full-time by a State and is a member of its retirement plan. The individual is also employed part-time by a city located in the State, but does not participate in the city's retirement plan. The services of the individual for the city are not excluded from employment under section 3121(b)(7), because the determination of whether services constitute employment for such purposes is made separately with respect to each political subdivision for which services are performed.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Definition of qualified participant</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule</E>—(i) <E T="03">Defined benefit retirement systems.</E> Whether an employee is a qualified participant in a defined benefit retirement system is determined as services are performed. An employee is a qualified participant in a defined benefit retirement system (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) with respect to services performed on a given day if, on that day, he or she is or ever has been an actual participant in the retirement system and, on that day, he or she actually has a total accrued benefit under the retirement system that meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. An employee may not be treated as an actual participant or as actually having an accrued benefit for this purpose to the extent that such participation or benefit is subject to any conditions (other than vesting), such as a requirement that the employee attain a minimum age, perform a minimum period of service, make an election in order to participate, or be present at the end of the plan year in order to be credited with an accrual, that have not been satisfied. The rules of this paragraph (d)(1)(i) are illustrated by the following examples:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>A State maintains a defined benefit plan that is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Under the terms of the plan, employees in positions covered by the plan must complete 6 months of service before becoming participants. The exception from employment in section 3121(b)(7) does not apply to services of an employee during the employee's 6 months of service prior to his or her initial entry into the plan. The same result occurs even if, upon the satisfaction of this service requirement, the employee is given credit under the plan for all service with the employer (i.e., if service is credited for the 6-month waiting period). This is true even if the employee makes a required contribution in order to gain the retroactive credit. The same result also occurs if the employee can elect to participate in the plan before the end of the 6-month waiting period, but does not elect to do so.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>A political subdivision maintains a defined benefit plan that is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Under the terms of the plan, service during a plan year is not credited for accrual purposes unless a participant has at least 1,000 hours of service during the year. Benefits that accrue only upon satisfaction of this 1,000-hour requirement may not be taken into account in determining whether an employee is a qualified participant in the plan before the 1,000-hour requirement is satisfied.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Defined contribution retirement systems.</E> Whether an employee is a qualified participant in a defined contribution retirement system is determined as services are performed. An employee is a qualified participant in a defined contribution or other individual account retirement system (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) with respect to services performed on a given day if, on that day, he or she has satisfied all conditions (other than vesting) for receiving an allocation to his or her account (exclusive of earnings) that meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to compensation during any period ending on that day and beginning on or after the beginning of the plan year of the retirement system. This is the case regardless of whether the allocations were made or accrued before the effective date of section 3121(b)(7)(F). This rule is illustrated by the following examples:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>A State-owned hospital maintains a nonelective defined contribution plan that is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Under the terms of the plan, employees must be employed on the last day of a plan year in order to receive any allocation for the year. Employees may not be treated as qualified participants in the plan before the last day of the year.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>Assume the same facts as in <E T="03">Example 1</E> except that, under the terms of the plan, an employee who terminates service before the end of a plan year receives a pro <PRTPAGE P="49"/>rata portion of the allocation he or she would have received at the end of the year, e.g., based on compensation earned since the beginning of the plan year. If the pro rata allocation available on a given day would meet the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to compensation from the beginning of the plan year through that day (or some later day), employees are treated as qualified participants in the plan on that day.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
                  <P>A political subdivision maintalns an elective defined contribution plan that is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The plan has a calendar year plan year and two open seasons—in December and June—when employees can change their contribution elections. In December, an employee elects not to contribute to the plan. In June, the employee elects (beginning July 1) to contribute a uniform percentage of compensation for each pay period to the plan for the remainder of the plan year. The employee is not a qualified participant in the plan during the period January-June, because no allocations are made to the employee's account with respect to compensation during that time, and it is not certain at that time that any allocations will be made. If the level of contributions during the period July-December meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to compensation during that period, however, the employee is treated as a qualified participant during that period.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4.</HD>
                  <P>Assume the same facts as in <E T="03">Example 3,</E> except that the plan allows participants to cancel their elections in cases of economic hardship. In October, the employee suffers an economic hardship and cancels the election (effective November 1). If the contributions during the period July-October are high enough to meet the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to compensation during that period, the employee is treated as a qualified participant during that period. In addition, if the contributions during the period July-October are high enough to meet the requirements for the entire period July-December, the employee is treated as a qualified participant in the plan throughout the period July-December, even though no allocations are made to the employee's account in the last two months of the year. There is no requirement that the period used to determine whether an employee is a qualified participant on a given day remain the same from day to day, as long as the period begins on or after the beginning of the plan year and ends on the date the determination is being made.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule for part-time, seasonal and temporary employees</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A part-time, seasonal or temporary employee is generally not a qualified participant on a given day unless any benefit relied upon to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is 100-percent nonforfeitable on that day. This requirement may be applied solely to the portion of an employee's benefit under the retirement system attributable to compensation and service while an employee is a part-time, seasonal or temporary employee, provided that such service is taken into account with respect to the remaining portion of the benefit for vesting purposes. Rules similar to the rules in section 411(a)(11) are applicable in determining whether a benefit is nonforfeitable. Thus, a benefit does not fail to be nonforfeitable solely because it can be immediately distributed upon separation of service without the consent of the employee, provided that the present value of the benefit does not exceed the cash-out limit in effect under § 1.411(a)-11(c)(3)(ii) of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Treatment of employees entitled to certain distributions upon death or separation from service.</E> A part-time, seasonal or temporary employee's benefit under a retirement system is considered nonforfeitable within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section on a given day if on that day the employee is unconditionally entitled under the retirement system to a single-sum distribution on account of death or separation from service of an amount that is at least equal to 7.5 percent of the participant's compensation (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) for all periods of credited service taken into account in determining whether the employee's benefit under the retirement system meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. An employee will be considered to be unconditionally entitled to a single-sum distribution notwithstanding the fact that the distribution may be forfeitable (in whole or in part) upon a finding of such employee's criminal misconduct. The participant must be entitled to interest on the distributable amount through the date of distribution, at a rate meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of <PRTPAGE P="50"/>this section, as part of the single sum. See paragraph (f)(2)(i)(C) for a transition rule relating to this nonforfeitable benefit safe harbor. The rule of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is illustrated by the following example:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>An employee is required to contribute 7.5 percent of his or her compensation to a State's defined benefit plan each year. The contribution is “picked up” by the employer in accordance with section 414(h). Under the plan, these amounts plus interest accrued since the date each amount was contributed are refundable to the employee in all cases upon the employee's death or separation from service with the employer. If the interest rate meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, then the employee's benefits under the plan are considered nonforfeitable and thus meet the requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Of course, the benefit under the plan must still meet the minimum retirement benefit requirement for defined benefit plans of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Definitions of part-time, seasonal and temporary employee</E>—(A) <E T="03">Definition of part-time employee.</E> For purposes of this section, a part-time employee is any employee who normally works 20 hours or less per week. A teacher employed by a post-secondary educational institution (e.g., a community or junior college, post-secondary vocational school, college, university or graduate school) is not considered a part-time employee for purposes of this section if he or she normally has classroom hours of one-half or more of the number of classroom hours designated by the educational institution as constituting full-time employment, provided that such designation is reasonable under all the facts and circumstances. In addition, elected officials and election workers (otherwise described in section 3121(b)(7)(F)(iv) but paid in excess of $100 annually) are not considered part-time, seasonal or temporary employees for purposes of this section. The rules of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) are illustrated by the following example:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>A community college treats a teacher as a full-time employee if the teacher is assigned to work 15 classroom hours per week. A new teacher is assigned to work 8 classroom hours per week. Because the assigned classroom hours of the teacher are at least one-half of the school's definition of full-time teacher, the teacher is not a part-time employee.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Definition of seasonal employee.</E> For purposes of this section, a seasonal employee is any employee who normally works on a full-time basis less than 5 months in a year. Thus, for example, individuals who are hired by a political subdivision during the tax return season in order to process incoming returns and work full-time over a 3-month period are seasonal employees.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Definition of temporary employee.</E> For purposes of this section, a temporary employee is any employee performing services under a contractual arrangement with the employer of 2 years or less duration. Possible contract extensions may be considered in determining the duration of a contractual arrangement, but only if, under the facts and circumstances, there is a significant likelihood that the employee's contract will be extended. Future contract extensions are considered significantly likely to occur for purposes of this rule if on average 80 percent of similarly situated employees (i.e., those in the same or a similar job classification with expiring employment contracts) have had bona fide offers to renew their contracts in the immediately preceding 2 academic or calendar years. In addition, future contract extensions are considered significantly likely to occur if the employee with respect to whom the determination is being made has a history of contract extensions with respect to his or her current position. An employee is not considered a temporary employee for purposes of this rule solely because he or she is included in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement of 2 years or less duration.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Treatment of employees participating in certain systems.</E> Whether an employee is a part-time, seasonal or temporary employee with respect to allocations or benefits under a retirement system is generally determined based on service in the position in which the allocations or benefits were earned, and does not take into account service in other positions with the same or different States, political subdivisions or instrumentalities thereof. All of an employee's service in other positions with the same or different <PRTPAGE P="51"/>States, political subdivisions or instrumentalities thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an employee is a part-time, seasonal or temporary employee with respect to benefits under the retirement system, however, <E T="03">Provided that:</E> The employee's service in the other positions is or was covered by the retirement system; all service aggregated for purposes of determining whether an employee is a part-time, seasonal or temporary employee (and related compensation) is aggregated under the system for all purposes in determining benefits (including vesting); and the employee is treated at least as favorably as a full-time employee under the retirement system for benefit accrual purposes. The rule of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(D) is illustrated by the following example:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>Assume that an employee works 15 hours per week for a county and 10 hours per week for a municipality, and that both of these political subdivisions contribute to the same state-wide public employee retirement system. Assume further that the employee's service in both positions is aggregated under the system for all purposes in determining benefits (including vesting). If the employee is covered under the retirement system with respect to both positions and is treated for benefit accrual purposes at least as favorably as full-time employees under the retirement system, then the employee is not considered a part-time employee of either the county or the municipality for purposes of the nonforfeitable benefit requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative lookback rule</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employee may be treated as a qualified participant in a retirement system throughout a calendar year if he or she was a qualified participant in such system (within the meaning of paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section) at the end of the plan year of the system ending in the previous calendar year. This rule is illustrated by the following examples:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>A political subdivision maintains a plan that is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. An employee is a qualified participant within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section in the plan on the last day of the plan year ending on May 31, 1995. If the alternative lookback rule is used to determine FICA liability, no such liability exists with respect to the employee or employer for calendar year 1996 by reason of section 3121(b)(7)(F). The same result would apply if the determination is being made with respect to calendar year 1992 and the lookback year was the plan year ending May 31, 1991, even though that plan year ended before the effective date of section 3121(b)(7)(F).</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>A political subdivision maintains an elective defined contribution plan described in section 457(b) of the Code. An employee is eligible to participate in the plan but does not elect to contribute for a plan year. Under the general rule of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the employee is not a qualified participant in the plan during the plan year because contributions sufficient to meet the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section are not being made. However, if an employee's status as a qualified participant is being determined under the alternative lookback rule, then the employee is a qualified participant for the calendar year in which the determination is being made if he of she was a qualified participant as of the end of the plan year that ended in the previous calendar year.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Application in first year of participation.</E> If the alternative lookback rule is used, an employee who participates in the retirement system may be treated as a qualified participant on any given day during his or her first plan year of participation in a retirement system (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) if and only if it is reasonable on such day to believe that the employee will be a qualified participant (within the meaning of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section) on the last day of such plan year. In the case of a defined contribution retirement system, the determination of whether the employee is actually (or is expected to be) a qualified participant at the end of the plan year must take into account all compensation since the commencement of participation. See paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section. If this reasonable belief is correct, and the employee is a qualified participant on the last day of his or her first plan year of participation, then the exception from employment in section 3121(b)(7) will apply without regard to section 3121(b)(7)(F) to services of the employee for the balance of the calendar year in which the plan year ends. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii), it is not reasonable to assume the establishment of a new plan until <PRTPAGE P="52"/>such establishment actually occurs. In addition, the rule in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) may not be used to treat an employee as a qualified participant until the employee actually becomes a participant in the retirement system. In the case of a retirement system that does not permit a new employee to participate until the first day of the first month beginning after the employee's commencement of service, or some earlier date, a new employee who is not a part-time, seasonal or temporary employee may be treated as a qualified participant until such date. This 1-month rule of administrative convenience applies without regard to whether the employer has a reasonable belief that the employee will be a qualified participant. The rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) are illustrated by the following examples:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>A political subdivision maintains a plan that is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section and uses the alternative lookback rule of this paragraph (d)(3). Under the terms of the plan, service during a plan year is not credited for accrual purposes unless a participant has at least 1,000 hours of service during the year. Assume that an employee becomes a participant. If it is reasonable to believe that the employee will be credited with 1,000 hours of service by the last day of his or her first year of participation and thereby become a qualified participant by reason of accruing a benefit that meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the services of the employee are not subject to FICA tax from the date of initial participation until the end of that plan year. If the employee is a qualified participant on the last day of his or her first plan year of participation, then the exception from employment for purposes of FICA will apply to services of the employee for the balance of the calendar year in which the plan year ended.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>Assume the same facts as <E T="03">Example 1,</E> except that the employee is a newly hired employee and the plan provides that an employee may not participate until the first day of his or her first full month of employment. Under the 1-month rule of convenience, the employee may be treated as a qualified participant until the first date on which he or she could participate in the plan.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Application in last year of participation.</E> If the alternative lookback rule is used, an employee may be treated as a qualified participant on any given day during his or her last year of participation in a retirement system (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) if and only if it is reasonable to believe on such day that the employee, will be a qualified participant (within the meaning of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section) on his or her last day of participation. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii), an employee's last year of participation means the plan year that the employer reasonably ascertains is the final year of such employee's participation (e.g., where the employee has a scheduled retirement date or where the employer intends to terminate the plan).</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Special rule for defined contribution retirement systems.</E> An employee may not be treated as a qualified participant in a defined contribution retirement system under this paragraph (d)(3) if compensation for less than a full plan year or other 12-month period is regularly taken into account in determining allocations to the employee's account for the plan year unless, under all of the facts and circumstances, such arrangement is not a device to avoid the imposition of FICA taxes. For example, an arrangement under which compensation taken into account is limited to the contribution base described in section 3121(x)(1) is not considered a device to avoid FICA taxes by reason of such limitation. See paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section for a rule permitting the use of such limitation. This rule is illustrated by the following example:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>A political subdivision maintains a defined contribution plan that covers all of its full-time employees and is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Under the plan, a portion of each participant's compensation in the final month of every plan year is allocated to the participant's account. Employees covered under the plan generally may not be treated as qualified participants under the alternative lookback rule for any portion of the calendar year following the year in which such allocation is made.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Consistency requirement.</E> Beginning with calendar year 1992, if the alternative lookback rule is used to determine whether an employee is a qualified participant, it must be used consistently from year to year and with respect to all employees of the State, <PRTPAGE P="53"/>political subdivision or instrumentality thereof making the determination. If a retirement system is sponsored by more than one State, political subdivision or instrumentality, this consistency requirement applies separately to each plan sponsor.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Treatment of former participants</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> In general, the rules of this paragraph (d) apply equally to former participants who continue to perform service for the same State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof or who return after a break in service. Thus, for example, a former employee of a political subdivision with a deferred benefit under a defined benefit retirement system maintained by the political subdivision who is reemployed by the political subdivision but does not resume participation in the retirement system, may continue to be a qualified participant in the system after becoming reemployed if his or her total accrued benefit under the system meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section (taking into account all periods of service (including current service) required to be taken into account under that paragraph). See also paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section for situations in which benefits under a retirement system may be taken into account even though they relate to service for another employer.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Treatment of re-hired annuitants.</E> An employee who is a former participant in a retirement system maintained by a State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof, who has previously retired from service with the State, political subdivision or instrumentality, and who is either in pay status (i.e., is currently receiving retirement benefits) under the retirement system or has reached nomal retirement age under the retirement system, is deemed to be a qualified participant in the retirement system without regard to whether he or she continues to accrue a benefit or whether the distribution of benefits under the retirement system has been suspended pending cessation of services. This rule also applies in the case of an employee who has retired from service with another State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof that maintains the same retirement system as the current employer, provided the employee is a former participant in the system by reason of the employee's former employment. Thus, for example, if a teacher retires from service with a school district that participates in a state-wide teachers' retirement system, begins to receive benefits from the system, and later becomes a substitute teacher in another school district that participates in the same state-wide system, the employee is treated as a re-hired annuitant under this paragraph (d)(4)(ii).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Definition of retirement system</E>—(1) <E T="03">Requirement that system provide retirement-type benefits.</E> For purposes of section 3121(b)(7)(F), a retirement system includes any pension, annuity, retirement or similar fund or system within the meaning of section 218 of the Social Security Act that is maintained by a State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof to provide retirement benefits to its employees who are participants. Whether a plan is maintained to provide retirement benefits with respect to an employee is determined under the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, a plan providing only retiree health insurance or other deferred welfare benefits is not considered a retirement system for this purpose. The legal form of the system is generally not relevant. Thus, for example, a retirement system may include a plan described in section 401(a), an annuity plan or contract under section 403 or a plan described in section 457(b) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the Social Security system is not a retirement system for purposes of section 3121(b)(7)(F) and this section. These rules are illustrated by the following examples:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>Under an employment arrangement, a portion of an employee's compensation is regularly deferred for 5 years. Because a plan that defers the receipt of compensation for a short span of time rather than until retirement is not a plan that provides retirement benefits, this arrangement is not a retirement system for purposes of section 3121(b)(7)(F).</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>

                  <P>An individual holds two positions with the same political subdivision. The wages earned in one position are subject to FICA tax pursuant to an agreement (under section 218 of the Social Security Act) <PRTPAGE P="54"/>between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the State in which the political subdivision is located. Because the Social Security system is not a retirement system for purposes of section 3121(b)(7)(F), the exception from employment in section 3121(b)(7) does not apply to service in the other position unless the employee is otherwise a member of a retirement system of such political subdivision.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Requirement that system provide minimum level of benefits</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A pension, annuity, retirement or similar fund or system is not a retirement system with respect to an employee unless it provides a retirement benefit to the employee that is comparable to the benefit provided under the Old-Age portion of the Old-Age, Survivor and Disability Insurance program of Social Security. Whether a retirement system meets this requirement is generally determined on an individual-by-individual basis. Thus, for example, a pension plan that is not a retirement system with respect to an employee may nevertheless be a retirement system with respect to other employees covered by the system.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Defined benefit retirement systems.</E> A defined benefit retirement system maintained by a State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof meets the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) with respect to an employee on a given day if and only if, on that day, the employee has an accrued benefit under the system that entitles the employee to an annual benefit commencing on or before his or her Social Security retirement age that is at least equal to the annual Primary Insurance Amount the employee would have under Social Security. For this purpose, the Primary Insurance Amount an individual would have under Social Security is determined as it would be under the Social Security Act if the employee had been covered under Social Security for all periods of service with the State, political subdivision or instrumentality, had never performed service for any other employer, and had been fully insured within the meaning of section 214(a) of the Social Security Act, except that all periods of service with the State, political subdivision or instrumentality must be taken into account (i.e., without reduction for low-earning years).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Defined contribution retirement systems</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> A defined contribution retirement system maintained by a State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section with respect to an employee if and only if allocations to the employee's account (not including earnings) for a period are at least 7.5 percent of the employee's compensation for service for the State, political subdivision or instrumentality during the period. Matching contributions by the employer may be taken into account for this purpose.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Definition of compensation.</E> The definition of compensation used in determining whether a defined contribution retirement system meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement must generally be no less inclusive than the definition of the employee's base pay as designated by the employer or the retirement system, provided such designation is reasonable under all the facts and circumstances. Thus, for example, a defined contribution retirement system will not fail to meet this requirement merely because it disregards for all purposes one or more of the following: overtime pay, bonuses, or single-sum amounts received on account of death or separation from service under a bona fide vacation, compensatory time or sick pay plan, or under severance pay plans. Furthermore, any compensation remaining after such amounts are disregarded that is in excess of the contribution base described in section 3121(x)(1) at the beginning of the plan year may also be disregarded. The rules of this paragraph are illustrated by the following example:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>A political subdivision maintains an elective defined contribution plan that is a retirement system within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The plan has a calendar year plan year. In 1995, an employee contributes to the plan at a rate of 7.5 percent of base pay. Assume that the employee will reach the maximum contribution base described in section 3121(x)(1) in October of 1995. The employee is a qualified participant in the plan for all of the 1995 plan year without regard to whether the employee ceases to participate at any time after reaching the maximum contribution base.</P>

                <P>(C) <E T="03">Reasonable interest rate requirement.</E> A defined contribution retirement system does not satisfy this paragraph (e)(2) with respect to an employee unless the employee's account is credited with earnings at a rate that is reasonable under all the facts and circumstances, or employees' accounts are held in a separate trust that is subject to general fiduciary standards and are credited with actual earnings on the trust fund. Whether the interest rate with which an employee's account is credited is reasonable is determined after reducing the rate to adjust for the payment of any administrative expenses. The rule of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) is illustrated by the following example:

                  <P>A political subdivision maintains a defined contribution plan described in section 457(b). Under the plan, the accounts of participants are credited annually on the basis of a variable interest rate formula determined as of the beginning of the plan year. The formula requires an interest rate (after adjustment for administrative expense payments) equal to 100 percent of the Applicable Federal Rate for long-term debt instruments. This interest rate constitutes a reasonable rate of interest.</P>

However, for individuals employed simultaneously in multiple positions with the same entity, this determination may (but is not required to) be made solely by reference to the service and compensation related to a single position of the employee with the State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof making the determination, provided that the position is not a part-time, seasonal or temporary position.</P>

                  <P>A State maintains a defined benefit plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. The plan does not cover a particular class of full-time employees as of July 1, 1991. However, in light of the enactment of section 3121(b)(7)(F), State officials administering the plan for the State intend to request that the legislature amend the State statute to include that class of employees in the existing plan and otherwise to modify the terms of the plan to meet the requirements of section 3121(b)(7)(F) and this section. The State legislature meets from January through March each year, and legislative action is required to expand coverage under the plan. State officials administering the plan have publicized the proposed amendment providing for the addition of these employees to the plan. Under the transition rule for 1991, if it is reasonable to believe that the legislature will pass this bill in the 1992 session, service by the employees who will be covered under the plan by reason of the amendment is not treated as employment by reason of section 3121(b)(7)(F) during the period prior to April 1, 1992. This is true regardless of whether the plan provides retroactive coverage for the period July 1, 1991 through March 31, 1992.</P>

Despite this action, in this situation the service by those employees during the period January 1, 1992 through March 31, 1992 is not excluded from “employment” under section 3121(b)(7)(F), and wages for that period are generally subject to FICA taxes even if the plan provides retroactive coverage for any portion of the period July 1, 1991 to March 31, 1992.</P>

Such a retirement system is also not subject to the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to an employee who becomes a participant after November 5, 1990, if he or she is employed in a position that was covered under the retirement system on November 5, 1990, without regard to whether such coverage was mandatory or elective. A retirement system is not described in this paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) if there has been a material decrease in the level of retirement benefits under the retirement system pursuant to an amendment adopted subsequent to November 5, 1990. Whether such a material decrease in benefits has occurred is determined under the facts and circumstances of each case. A decrease in benefits is not material to the extent that it does not decrease the benefit payable at normal retirement age. These rules are illustrated by the following examples:

This amendment constitutes a material decrease in the level of benefit under the retirement plan. Therefore, the retirement plan is subject to the minimum retirement benefit requirement for the plan year for which the amendment is effective and for all succeeding plan years.</P>

                  <P>A defined benefit retirement plan that was in existence on November 5, <PRTPAGE P="57"/>1990, is subsequently amended to include part-time employees. Previously, this class of employees was not covered under the plan either on a mandatory or on an elective basis. The plan is subject to the minimum retirement benefit requirement with respect to the part-time employees because this class of employees was previously excluded from coverage under the retirement plan. Of course, the nonforfeitable benefit rule applies to the benefit relied upon to meet the minimum retirement benefit requirement with respect to any part-time, seasonal or temporary employee covered during this period.</P>

                <P>(B) <E T="03">Treatment in plan years beginning after 1992 of benefits accrued during previous plan years.</E> The general rule that a defined benefit retirement system meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement on the basis of total benefits and service accrued to date is modified for plans in existence on November 5, 1990. If a defined benefit retirement system in existence on November 5, 1990, does not meet the minimum retirement benefit requirement solely because the benefits accrued for an employee (with respect to whom the system is entitled to relief under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section) as of the last day of the last plan year beginning before January 1, 1993, do not meet the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to service and compensation before that time, then the retirement system will be deemed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section if the future service accruals would comply with the requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If retirement benefits under a retirement system in existence on November 5, 1990 are materially decreased within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, then the date the decrease is effective is substituted for January 1, 1993 for purposes of this paragraph. The rule of this paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) is illustrated by the following example:

                  <P>A defined benefit plan maintained by a State was in existence on November 5, 1990. It provides a retirement benefit on the last day of the 1992 plan year that is insufficient to meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section based on employees' total service and compensation with the State at that time. The plan will nevertheless meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section if it is amended to provide benefits sufficient to meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section based on employees' service and compensation in plan years beginning after December 31, 1992.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Treatment of part-time, seasonal or temporary employees.</E> A defined benefit retirement system is not exempt from the minimum retirement benefit requirement with respect to a part-time, seasonal or temporary employee during the transition period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section unless any retirement benefit provided to the employee is 100-percent nonforfeitable within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In determining whether the benefit is nonforfeitable, the special rule in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is modified in two respects during the transition period: first, the percentage of compensation required to be available for distribution is reduced from 7.5 percent to 6 percent; and second, the period of service with respect to which compensation must be determined is modified to include all periods of participation by the employee in the system since July 1, 1991.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Application of minimum retirement benefit requirement to defined contribution retirement systems in plan years beginning before 1993.</E> A defined contribution retirement system maintained by a State, political subdivision or instrumentality thereof on November 5, 1990, meets the minimum retirement benefit requirement of paragraph (e) (2) of this section with respect to an employee for any plan year beginning before January 1, 1993, if mandatory allocations to the employee's account (not including earnings) for a period are at least 6 percent (rather than 7.5 percent) of the employee's compensation for service to the State, political subdivision or instrumentality during the period, and the plan otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. This transition rule is only available with respect to an employee who is actually covered under the system on November 5, 1990, and to an employee who becomes a participant after November 5, 1990, if he or she is employed in a position that was covered under the retirement system on November 5, 1990, without regard to <PRTPAGE P="58"/>whether such coverage was mandatory or elective. In addition, this transition rule is not available with respect to a part-time, seasonal or temporary employee unless the mandatory allocation required under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) is 100-percent nonforfeitable within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. A retirement system is not described in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) if there has been a material decrease in the level of retirement benefits under the retirement system pursuant to an amendment adopted subsequent to November 5, 1990. Whether such a material decrease in benefits has occurred is determined under all the facts and circumstances.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Application of qualified participant rules.</E> A participant with respect to whom relief is granted under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section may be treated as a qualified participant in the defined benefit retirement system on a given day if, on that day, he or she is actually a participant in the retirement system, and, on that day, it is reasonable to believe that the participant will actually accrue a benefit before the end of the plan year of such retirement system in which the determination is made. A participant is not treated as accruing a benefit for purposes of this rule if his or her accrued benefits increase solely as a result of an increase in compensation. However, an employee is treated as a qualified participant for a plan year if the employee meets all of the applicable conditions for accruing the maximum current benefit for such year but fails to accrue a benefit solely because of a uniformly applicable benefit limit under the plan. In addition, an employee may be treated as a qualified participant in the system on a given day if the employee is a re-hired annuitant within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. This rule is illustrated by the following example:

If the plan is not subject to the minimum retirement benefit requirement, an employee who is a participant in the retirement plan as of the end of a plan year beginning before January 1, 1993, and may reasonably be expected to accrue a benefit under the plan by the end of such plan year may be treated as a qualified participant in the plan throughout the plan year regardless of the actual amount of the accrual.</P>

Any religious organization is deemed to be under the authority of a religious body constituting a church or church denomination if it is organized and dedicated to carrying out the tenets and principles of a faith in accordance with either the requirements or sanctions governing the creation of institutions of the faith.

Although all of the services performed by A during the first quarter were excepted, none of A's services performed during the second quarter are excepted since the remuneration for such services is not less than $50. The taxes attach with respect to all of the remuneration for services performed during the second quarter (that is, $60) as and when paid.</P>

The preceding sentence shall not apply to services performed in the employ of a school, college, or university of a State or a political subdivision thereof by a student referred to in section 218(c)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 418(c)(5)) if such services are covered under the agreement between the Commissioner of Social Security and such State entered into pursuant to section 218 of such Act. For the definitions of “operated, supervised, or controlled by”, “supervised or controlled in connection with”, and “operated in connection with”, see paragraphs (g), (h), and (i), respectively, of § 1.509(a)-4.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Statutory tests.</E> For purposes of this section, if an employee has the status of a student within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section, the amount of remuneration for services performed by the employee, the type of services performed by the employee, and the place where the services are performed are not material. The statutory tests are:</P>
                <P>(1) The character of the organization in the employ of which the services are performed as a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, or as an organization described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and</P>

                <P>(2) The status of the employee as a student enrolled and regularly attending classes within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section at the school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section by which the employee is employed or <PRTPAGE P="62"/>with which the employee's employer is affiliated within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">School, College, or University.</E> An organization is a <E T="03">school, college, or university</E> within the meaning of section 3121(b)(10) if its primary function is the presentation of formal instruction, it normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum, and it normally has a regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on. See section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Student Status—general rule.</E> Whether an employee has the status of a student performing the services shall be determined based on the relationship of the employee with the organization employing the employee. In order to have the status of a student, the employee must perform services in the employ of a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section at which the employee is enrolled and regularly attending classes in pursuit of a course of study within the meaning of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. In addition, the employee's services must be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section at such school, college, or university. An employee who performs services in the employ of an affiliated organization within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be enrolled and regularly attending classes at the affiliated school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section in pursuit of a course of study within the meaning of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. In addition, the employee's services must be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section at such school, college, or university.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Enrolled and regularly attending classes.</E> An employee must be enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section at which the employee is employed to have the status of a student within the meaning of section 3121(b)(10). An employee is enrolled within the meaning of section 3121(b)(10) if the employee is registered for a course or courses creditable toward an educational credential described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In addition, the employee must be regularly attending classes to have the status of a student. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), a class is an instructional activity led by a faculty member or other qualified individual hired by the school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section for identified students following an established curriculum. Traditional classroom activities are not the sole means of satisfying this requirement. For example, research activities under the supervision of a faculty advisor necessary to complete the requirements for a Ph.D. degree may constitute classes within the meaning of section 3121(b)(10). The frequency of these and similar activities determines whether an employee may be considered to be regularly attending classes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Course of study.</E> An employee must be pursuing a course of study in order to have the status of a student. A course of study is one or more courses the completion of which fulfills the requirements necessary to receive an educational credential granted by a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, an educational credential is a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential granted by an organization described in paragraph (c) of this section. A course of study also includes one or more courses at a school, college or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section the completion of which fulfills the requirements necessary for the employee to sit for an examination required to receive certification by a recognized organization in a field.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.</E> (i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> An employee's services must be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study in order for the employee to have the status of a student. Whether an employee's services are incident to and for the purpose of <PRTPAGE P="63"/>pursuing a course of study shall be determined on the basis of the relationship of the employee with the organization for which such services are performed as an employee. The educational aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the relationship, must be predominant in order for the employee's services to be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. The educational aspect of the relationship is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances related to the educational aspect of the relationship. The service aspect of the relationship is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances related to the employee's employment. The evaluation of the service aspect of the relationship is not affected by the fact that the services performed by the employee may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, whether the educational aspect or the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is predominant is determined by considering all the relevant facts and circumstances. Relevant factors in evaluating the educational and service aspects of an employee's relationship with the employer are described in paragraphs (d)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section respectively. There may be facts and circumstances that are relevant in evaluating the educational and service aspects of the relationship in addition to those described in paragraphs (d)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Student status determined with respect to each academic term.</E> Whether an employee's services are incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study is determined separately with respect to each academic term. If the relevant facts and circumstances with respect to an employee's relationship with the employer change significantly during an academic term, whether the employee's services are incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study is reevaluated with respect to services performed during the remainder of the academic term.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Full-time employee.</E> The services of a full-time employee are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. The determination of whether an employee is a full-time employee is based on the employer's standards and practices, except regardless of the employer's classification of the employee, an employee whose normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week is considered a full-time employee. An employee's normal work schedule is not affected by increases in hours worked caused by work demands unforeseen at the start of an academic term. However, whether an employee is a full-time employee is reevaluated for the remainder of the academic term if the employee changes employment positions with the employer. An employee's work schedule during academic breaks is not considered in determining whether the employee's normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week. The determination of an employee's normal work schedule is not affected by the fact that the services performed by the employee may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Evaluating educational aspect.</E> The educational aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances related to the educational aspect of the relationship. The educational aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is generally evaluated based on the employee's course workload. Whether an employee's course workload is sufficient in order for the employee's employment to be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study depends on the particular facts and circumstances. A relevant factor in evaluating an employee's course workload is the employee's course workload relative to a full-time course workload at the school, college or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section at which the employee is enrolled and regularly attending classes.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Evaluating service aspect.</E> The service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is evaluated based on the facts and circumstances related to the employee's employment. Services of an employee with the status of a full-time employee within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this <PRTPAGE P="64"/>section are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. Relevant factors in evaluating the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer are described in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Normal work schedule and hours worked.</E> If an employee is not a full-time employee within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, then the employee's normal work schedule and number of hours worked per week are relevant factors in evaluating the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer. As an employee's normal work schedule or actual number of hours worked approaches 40 hours per week, it is more likely that the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. The determination of an employee's normal work schedule and actual number of hours worked is not affected by the fact that some of the services performed by the employee may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Professional employee.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) If an employee has the status of a professional employee, then that suggests the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. A professional employee is an employee—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Whose primary duty consists of the performance of work requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study, as distinguished from a general academic education, from an apprenticeship, and from training in the performance of routine mental, manual, or physical processes;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Whose work requires the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Whose work is predominantly intellectual and varied in character (as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical work) and is of such character that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Licensed, professional employee.</E> If an employee is a licensed, professional employee, then that further suggests the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. An employee is a licensed, professional employee if the employee is required to be licensed under state or local law to work in the field in which the employee performs services and the employee is a professional employee within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Employment Benefits.</E> Whether an employee is eligible to receive one or more employment benefits is a relevant factor in evaluating the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer. For example, eligibility to receive vacation, paid holiday, and paid sick leave benefits; eligibility to participate in a retirement plan or arrangement described in sections 401(a), 403(b), or 457(a); or eligibility to receive employment benefits such as reduced tuition (other than qualified tuition reduction under section 117(d)(5) provided to a teaching or research assistant who is a graduate student), or benefits under sections 79 (life insurance), 127 (qualified educational assistance), 129 (dependent care assistance programs), or 137 (adoption assistance) suggest that the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. Eligibility to receive health insurance employment benefits is not considered in determining whether the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. The weight to be given the fact that an employee is eligible for a particular employment benefit may vary depending on the type of benefit. For example, eligibility to participate in a retirement plan is generally more significant than eligibility to receive a dependent care employment benefit. Additional weight is given to the fact that an employee is eligible to receive an employment benefit if the benefit is generally provided by the employer to employees in positions generally held by non-students. Less weight is given to the fact that an employee is eligible to receive an employment benefit if eligibility for the benefit is mandated by state or local law.<PRTPAGE P="65"/>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>(i) Employee C is employed by State University T to provide services as a clerk in T's administrative offices, and is enrolled and regularly attending classes at T in pursuit of a B.S. degree in biology. C has a course workload during the academic term which constitutes a full-time course workload at T. C is considered a part-time employee by T during the academic term, and C's normal work schedule is 20 hours per week, but occasionally due to work demands unforeseen at the start of the academic term C works 40 hours or more during a week. C is compensated by hourly wages, and receives no other compensation or employment benefits.</P>
                  <P>(ii) In this <E T="03">example,</E> C is employed by T, a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. C is enrolled and regularly attending classes at T in pursuit of a course of study. C is not a full-time employee based on T's standards, and C's normal work schedule does not cause C to have the status of a full-time employee, even though C may occasionally work 40 hours or more during a week due to unforeseen work demands. C's part-time employment relative to C's full-time course workload indicates that the educational aspect of C's relationship with T is predominant. Additional facts supporting this conclusion are that C is not a professional employee, and C does not receive any employment benefits. Thus, C's services are incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. Accordingly, C's services are excepted from employment under section 3121(b)(10).</P>

However, because D is considered a full-time employee by U under its standards and practices, D's services are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.

However, D receives vacation, sick leave, and paid holiday employment benefits, and D is eligible to participate in a retirement plan maintained by U described in section 401(a).</P>
                  <P>(ii) In this <E T="03">example,</E> D's half-time course workload relative to D's hours worked and eligibility for employment benefits indicates that the service aspect of D's relationship with U is predominant, and thus D's services are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.

The residency program in which E participates is accredited by the Accreditation Counsel for Graduate Medical Education. Upon completion of the program, E will receive a certificate of completion, and be eligible to sit for an examination required to be certified by a recognized organization in the medical specialty. E's normal work schedule, which includes services having an educational, instructional, or training aspect, is 40 hours or more per week.</P>
                  <P>(ii) In this <E T="03">example,</E> E is employed by V, a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. However, E's normal work schedule calls for E to perform services 40 or more hours per week. E is therefore a full-time employee, and the fact that some of E's services have an educational, instructional, or training aspect does not affect that conclusion. Thus, E's services are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. Accordingly, E's services are not excepted from employment under section 3121(b)(10) and there is no need to consider other relevant factors, such as whether E is a professional employee or whether E is eligible for employment benefits.</P>

                  <P>The AB Club, which is a local college club within the meaning of section 3121(b)(2), employs D, a student who is enrolled and is regularly attending classes at a university, to perform domestic service for the club and to keep the club's books. The domestic services performed by D for the AB Club do not constitute employment, and his services as the club's bookkeeper constitute employment. D receives a payment at the end of each month for all services which he performs for the club. During a particular month D spends 60 hours in performing domestic service for the club and 40 hours as the club's bookkeeper. None of D's services during the month are deemed to be employment, since less than one-half of his services during the month constitutes employment. During another month D spends 35 hours in the performance of domestic services and 60 hours in keeping the club's books. All of D's services during the month are deemed to be employment, since one-half or more of his services during the month constitutes employment.</P>

                <P>(e) For purposes of this section, a “pay period” is the period (of not more than 31 consecutive calendar days) for which a payment of remuneration is <PRTPAGE P="72"/>ordinarily made to the employee by the employer. Thus, if the periods for which payments of remuneration are made to the employee by the employer are of uniform duration, each such period constitutes a “pay period”. If, however, the periods occasionally vary in duration, the “pay period” is the period for which a payment of remuneration is ordinarily made to the employee by the employer, even though that period does not coincide with the actual period for which a particular payment of remuneration is made. For example, if an employer ordinarily pays a particular employee for each calendar week at the end of the week, but the employee receives a payment in the middle of the week for the portion of the week already elapsed and receives the remainder at the end of the week, the “pay period” is still the calendar week; or if, instead, that employee is sent on a trip by such employer and receives at the end of the third week a single remuneration payment for three weeks' services, the “pay period” is still the calendar week.</P>
                <P>(f) If there is only one period (and such period does not exceed 31 consecutive calendar days) for which a payment of remuneration is made to the employee by the employer, such period is deemed to be a “pay period” for purposes of this section.</P>
                <P>(g) The rules set forth in this section do not apply (1) with respect to any services performed by the employee for the employer if the periods for which such employer makes payments of remuneration to the employee vary to the extent that there is no period “for which a payment of remuneration is ordinarily made to the employee”, or (2) with respect to any services performed by the employee for the employer if the period for which a payment of remuneration is ordinarily made to the employee by such employer exceeds 31 consecutive calendar days, or (3) with respect to any service performed by the employee for the employer during a pay period if any of such service is excepted by section 3121(b)(9) (see § 31.3121(b)(9)-1).</P>
                <P>(h) If during any period for which a person makes a payment of remuneration to an employee only a portion of the employee's services constitutes employment, but the rules prescribed in this section are not applicable, the taxes attach with respect to such services as constitute employment as defined in section 3121(b).</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 31.3121(d)-1</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Who are employees.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) Whether an individual is an employee with respect to services performed after 1954 is determined in accordance with section 3121(d) and (o) and section 3506. This section of the regulations applies with respect only to services performed after 1954. Whether an individual is an employee with respect to services performed after 1936 and before 1940 shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 401 (Regulations 91). Whether an individual is an employee with respect to services performed after 1939 and before 1951 shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 402 (Regulations 106). Whether an individual is an employee with respect to services performed after 1950 and before 1955 shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 408 (Regulations 128).</P>
                <P>(2) Section 3121(d) contains three separate and independent tests for determining who are employees. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section relate to the respective tests. Paragraph (b) relates to the test for determining whether an officer of a corporation is an employee of the corporation. Paragraph (c) relates to the test for determining whether an individual is an employee under the usual common law rules. Paragraph (d) relates to the test for determining which individuals in certain occupational groups who are not employees under the usual common law rules are included as employees. If an individual is an employee under any one of the tests, he is to be considered an employee for purposes of the regulations in this subpart whether or not he is an employee under any of the other tests.</P>

                <P>(3) If the relationship of employer and employee exists, the designation or <PRTPAGE P="73"/>description of the relationship by the parties as anything other than that of employer and employee is immaterial. Thus, if such relationship exists, it is of no consequence that the employee is designated as a partner, coadventurer, agent, independent contractor, or the like.</P>
                <P>(4) All classes or grades of employees are included within the relationship of employer and employee. Thus, superintendents, managers, and other supervisory personnel are employees.</P>
                <P>(5) Although an individual may be an employee under this section, his services may be of such a nature, or performed under such circumstances, as not to constitute employment (see § 31.3121(b)-3).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Corporate officers.</E> Generally, an officer of a corporation is an employee of the corporation. However, an officer of a corporation who as such does not perform any services or performs only minor services and who neither receives nor is entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, any remuneration is considered not to be an employee of the corporation. A director of a corporation in his capacity as such is not an employee of the corporation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Common law employees.</E> (1) Every individual is an employee if under the usual common law rules the relationship between him and the person for whom he performs services is the legal relationship of employer and employee.</P>
                <P>(2) Generally such relationship exists when the person for whom services are performed has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished. That is, an employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but how it shall be done. In this connection, it is not necessary that the employer actually direct or control the manner in which the services are performed; it is sufficient if he has the right to do so. The right to discharge is also an important factor indicating that the person possessing that right is an employer. Other factors characteristic of an employer, but not necessarily present in every case, are the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a place to work, to the individual who performs the services. In general, if an individual is subject to the control or direction of another merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is an independent contractor. An individual performing services as an independent contractor is not as to such services an employee under the usual common law rules. Individuals such as physicians, lawyers, dentists, veterinarians, construction contractors, public stenographers, and auctioneers, engaged in the pursuit of an independent trade, business, or profession, in which they offer their services to the public, are independent contractors and not employees.</P>
                <P>(3) Whether the relationship of employer and employee exists under the usual common law rules will in doubtful cases be determined upon an examination of the particular facts of each case.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Special classes of employees.</E> (1) In addition to individuals who are employees under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, other individuals are employees if they perform services for remuneration under certain prescribed circumstances in the following occupational groups:</P>
                <P>(i) As an agent-driver or commission-driver engaged in distributing meat products, vegetable products, fruit products, bakery products, beverages (other than milk), or laundry or dry-cleaning services for his principal;</P>
                <P>(ii) As a full-time life insurance salesman;</P>
                <P>(iii) As a home worker performing work, according to specifications furnished by the person for whom the services are performed, on materials or goods furnished by such person which are required to be returned to such person or a person designated by him; or</P>

                <P>(iv) As a traveling or city salesman, other than as an agent-driver or commission-driver, engaged upon a full-time basis in the solicitation on behalf of, and the transmission to, his principal (except for side-line sales activities on behalf of some other person) of <PRTPAGE P="74"/>orders from wholesalers, retailers, contractors, or operators of hotels, restaurants, or other similar establishments for merchandise for resale or supplies for use in their business operations.</P>
                <P>(2) In order for an individual to be an employee under this paragraph, the individual must perform services in an occupation falling within one of the enumerated groups. If the individual does not perform services in one of the designated occupational groups, he is not an employee under this paragraph. An individual who is not an employee under this paragraph may nevertheless be an employee under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The language used to designate the respective occupational groups relates to fields of endeavor in which particular designations are not necessarily in universal use with respect to the same service. The designations are addressed to the actual services without regard to any technical or colloquial labels which may be attached to such services. Thus, a determination whether services fall within one of the designated occupational groups depends upon the facts of the particular situation.</P>
                <P>(3) The factual situations set forth below are illustrative of some of the individuals falling within each of the above enumerated occupational groups. The illustrative factual situations are as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Agent-driver or commission-driver.</E> This occupational group includes agent-drivers or commission-drivers who are engaged in distributing meat or meat products, vegetables or vegetable products, fruit or fruit products, bakery products, beverages (other than milk), or laundry or dry-cleaning services for their principals. An agent-driver or commission-driver includes an individual who operates his own truck or the truck of the person for whom he performs services, serves customers designated by such person as well as those solicited on his own, and whose compensation is a commission on his sales or the difference between the price he charges his customers and the price he pays to such person for the product or service.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Full-time life insurance salesman.</E> An individual whose entire or principal business activity is devoted to the solicitation of life insurance or annuity contracts, or both, primarily for one life insurance company is a full-time life insurance salesman. Such a salesman ordinarily uses the office space provided by the company or its general agent, and stenographic assistance, telephone facilities, forms, rate books, and advertising materials are usually made available to him without cost. An individual who is engaged in the general insurance business under a contract or contracts of service which do not contemplate that the individual's principal business activity will be the solicitation of life insurance or annuity contracts, or both, for one company, or any individual who devotes only part time to the solicitation of life insurance contracts, including annuity contracts, and is principally engaged in other endeavors, is not a full-time life insurance salesman.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Home workers.</E> This occupational group includes a worker who performs services off the premises of the person for whom the services are performed, according to specifications furnished by such person, on materials or goods furnished by such person which are required to be returned to such person or a person designated by him. For provisions relating to the determination of wages in the case of a home worker to whom this subdivision is applicable, see § 31.3121(a)(10)-1.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Traveling or city salesman.</E> (<E T="03">a</E>) This occupational group includes a city or traveling salesman who is engaged upon a full-time basis in the solicitation on behalf of, and the transmission to, his principal (except for side-line sales activities on behalf of some other person or persons) of orders from wholesalers, retailers, contractors, or operators of hotels, restaurants, or other similar establishments for merchandise for resale or supplies for use in their business operations. An agent-driver or commission-driver is not within this occupational group. City or traveling salesmen who sell to retailers or to the others specified, operate off the premises of their principals, and are generally compensated on a commission basis, are within this occupational group. Such salesmen are generally not controlled as to the details <PRTPAGE P="75"/>of their services or the means by which they cover their territories, but in the ordinary case they are expected to call on regular customers with a fair degree of regularity.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) In order for a city or traveling salesman to be included within this occupational group, his entire or principal business activity must be devoted to the solicitation of orders for one principal. Thus, the multiple-line salesman generally is not within this occupational group. However, if the salesman solicits orders primarily for one principal, he is not excluded from this occupational group solely because of side-line sales activities on behalf of one or more other persons. In such a case, the salesman is within this occupational group only with respect to the services performed for the person for whom he primarily solicits orders and not with respect to the services performed for such other persons. The following examples illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions:

B regularly solicits orders on behalf of both companies. B is not within this occupational group with respect to the services performed for either the R Company or the S Company.</P>

                  <P>Salesman C's principal business activity is the house-to-house solicitation of orders on behalf of the T Brush Company. C occasionally solicits such orders from retail stores and restaurants. C is not within this occupational group.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                

                <P>(4)(i) The fact that an individual falls within one of the enumerated occupational groups, however, does not make such individual an employee under this paragraph unless (<E T="03">a</E>) the contract of service contemplates that substantially all the services to which the contract relates in the particular designated occupation are to be performed personally by such individual, (<E T="03">b</E>) such individual has no substantial investment in the facilities used in connection with the performance of such services (other than in facilities for transportation) and (<E T="03">c</E>) such services are part of a continuing relationship with the person for whom the services are performed and are not in the nature of a single transaction.</P>
                <P>(ii) The term “contract of service”, as used in this paragraph, means an arrangement, formal or informal, under which the particular services are performed. The requirement that the contract of service shall contemplate that substantially all the services to which the contract relates in the particular designated occupation are to be performed personally by the individual means that it is not contemplated that any material part of the services to which the contract relates in such occupation will be delegated to any other person by the individual who undertakes under the contract to perform such services.</P>
                <P>(iii) The facilities to which reference is made in this paragraph include equipment and premises available for the work or enterprise as distinguished from education, training, and experience, but do not include such tools, instruments, equipment, or clothing, as are commonly or frequently provided by employees. An investment in an automobile by an individual which is used primarily for his own transportation in connection with the performance of services for another person has no significance under this paragraph, since such investment is comparable to outlays for transportation by an individual performing similar services who does not own an automobile. Moreover, the investment in facilities for the transportation of the goods or commodities to which the services relate is to be excluded in determining the investment in a particular case. If an individual has a substantial investment in facilities of the requisite character, he is not an employee within the meaning of this paragraph, since a substantial investment of the requisite character standing alone is sufficient to exclude the individual from the employee concept under this paragraph.</P>

                <P>(iv) If the services are not performed as part of a continuing relationship with the person for whom the services <PRTPAGE P="76"/>are performed, but are in the nature of a single transaction, the individual performing such services is not an employee of such person within the meaning of this paragraph. The fact that the services are not performed on consecutive workdays does not indicate that the services are not performed as part of a continuing relationship.</P>

                <P>(3) Since the services described in this paragraph must be performed in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of the farm, the term “agricultural labor” does not include services performed by employees of a commercial painting concern, for example, which contracts with a farmer to renovate his farm properties.</P>

                <P>(2) The term “operator of a farm” as used in this paragraph means an owner, tenant, or other person, in possession of a farm and engaged in the operation of such farm.</P>
                <P>(3) The services described in this paragraph do not constitute agricultural labor if performed in the employ of a cooperative organization. The term “organization” includes corporations, joint-stock companies, and associations which are treated as corporations pursuant to section 7701(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this paragraph, any unincorporated group of operators shall be deemed a cooperative organization if the number of operators comprising such group is more than 20 at any time during the calendar quarter in which the services involved are performed.</P>
                <P>(4) Processing services which change the commodity from its raw or natural state do not constitute agricultural labor. For example the extraction of juices from fruits or vegetables is a processing operation which changes the character of the fruits or vegetables from their raw or natural state and, therefore, does not constitute agricultural labor. Likewise, services performed in the processing of maple sap into maple sirup or maple sugar do not constitute agricultural labor. On the other hand, services rendered in the cutting and drying of fruits or vegetables are processing operations which do not change the character of the fruits or vegetables and, therefore, constitute agricultural labor, if the other requisite conditions are met. Services performed with respect to a commodity after its character has been changed from its raw or natural state by a processing operation do not constitute agricultural labor.</P>
                <P>(5) The term “commodity” refers to a single agricultural or horticultural product, for example, all apples are to be treated as a single commodity, while apples and peaches are to be treated as two separate commodities. The services with respect to each such commodity are to be considered separately in determining whether the condition set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section has been satisfied. The portion of the commodity produced by an operator or group of operators with respect to which the services described in this paragraph are performed by a particular employee shall be determined on the basis of the pay period in which such services were performed by such employee.</P>
                <P>(6) The services described in this paragraph do not include services performed in connection with commercial canning or commercial freezing or in connection with any commodity after its delivery to a terminal market for distribution for consumption. Moreover, since the services described in this paragraph must be rendered in the actual handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, grading, storing, or delivering to storage or to market or to a carrier for transportation to market, of the commodity, such services do not, for example, include services performed as stenographers, bookkeepers, clerks, and other office employees, even though such services may be in connection with such activities. However, to the extent that the services of such individuals are performed in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of a farm and are rendered in major part on a farm, they may be within the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Services described in section 3121(g)(5).</E> (1) Service not in the course of the employer's trade or business (see paragraph (a)(1) of § 31.3121(a)(7)-1) or domestic service in a private home of the employer (see paragraph (a)(2) of § 31.3121(a)(7)-1) constitutes agricultural labor if such service is performed on a farm operated for profit. The determination whether remuneration for <PRTPAGE P="79"/>any such service performed on a farm operated for profit constitutes wages is to be made under § 31.3121(a)(8)-1 rather than under § 31.3121(a)(7)-1.

                <SUBJECT>Computation to nearest dollar of cash remuneration for domestic service.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An employer may, for purposes of the act, elect to compute to the nearest dollar any payment of cash remuneration for domestic service described in section 3121(a)(7)(B) (see § 31.3121(a)(7)-1) which is more or less than a whole-dollar amount. For the purpose of the computation to the nearest dollar, the payment of a fractional part of a dollar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half dollar or more, in which case it shall be increased to one dollar. For example, any amount actually paid between $4.50 and $5.49, inclusive, may be treated as $5 for purposes of the taxes imposed by the act. If an employer elects this method of computation with respect to any payment of cash remuneration made in a calendar year for domestic service in his private home, he must use the same method in computing each payment of cash remuneration of more or less than a whole-dollar amount made to each of his employees in such calendar year for domestic service in his private home. Moreover, if an employer elects this method of computation with respect to payments of the prescribed character made in any calendar year, the amount of each payment of cash remuneration so computed to the nearest dollar shall, in lieu of the amount actually paid, be deemed to constitute the amount of cash remuneration for purposes of the act. Thus, the amount of cash payments so computed to the nearest dollar shall be used for purposes of determining whether such payments constitute wages; for purposes of applying the employee and employer tax rates to the wage payments; for purposes of any required record keeping; and for purposes of reporting and paying the employee tax and employer tax with respect to such wage payments.</P>

                <P>(b) The provisions of this section apply to any cash payment for domestic service in a private home of the employer made on or after January 1, 1994.

                <SUBJECT>Computation of remuneration for service performed by certain members of religious orders.</SUBJECT>

                <P>In any case where an individual is a member of a religious order (as defined in section 3121(r)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 31.3121(r)-1) performing service in the exercise of duties required by such order, and an election of coverage under section 3121(r) and § 31.3121(r)-1 is in effect with respect to such order or the autonomous subdivision thereof to which such member belongs, the term “wages” shall, subject to the provisions of section 3121(a)(1) (relating to definition of wages), include as such individual's remuneration for such service the fair market value of any board, lodging, clothing, and other perquisites furnished to such member by such order or subdivision or by any other person or organization pursuant to an agreement (whether written or oral) with such order or subdivision. Such other perquisites shall include any cash either paid by such order or subdivision or paid by another employer and not required by such order or subdivision to be remitted to it. For purposes of this section, perquisites shall be considered to be furnished over the period during which the member receives the benefit of them. (See example 4 of this section.) In no case shall the amount included as such individual's remuneration under this paragraph be less than $100 a month. All relevant facts and elements of value shall be considered in every case. Where the fair market value of any board, lodging, clothing, and other perquisites furnished to all members of an electing religious order or autonomous subdivision (or to all in a group of members) does not vary significantly, such order or subdivision may treat all of its members (or all in such group of members) as having a uniform wage. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples of the treatment of particular perquisites:

The fair market value of such clothing (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the price at which such items would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell) is determined by reference to the actual sales price of these suppliers to the religious orders.</P>

Students at the university obtain lodging and board on campus from the university for its fair market value of $2,000 for the school year. Such lodging and board is essentially the same as that provided by N at its seminary to N's members subject to a vow of poverty. Accordingly, the amount to <PRTPAGE P="81"/>be included in the “wages” of such members with respect to lodging and board for the same period of time is $2,000.</P>

Under section 3121(i)(4), O must include in the wages of its members assigned to this monastery the fair market value of the board and lodging furnished to them. In making a determination of the fair market value of such board and lodging, the remoteness of the monastery, as well as the smallness of the rooms and the simplicity of their furnishings, affect this determination.

P pays the university $1,000 at the beginning of each semester for the board and lodging of each of such members. In addition, P gives each such member a $400 cash advance to cover his miscellaneous expenses during the semester.

Q has convents in rural South America and in suburbs and central city areas of the United States. Characteristically, in the United States its suburban convents provide somewhat larger and newer rooms for its members than do its convents in city areas. Moreover, its suburban convents have more extensive grounds and somewhat more elaborate facilities than do its older convents in city areas. However, both types of convents limit resident members to a single, plainly furnished room and provide them meals which are comparable. Q's members in South America live in extremely primitive dwellings and otherwise have extremely modest perquisites. Under section 3121(i)(4), Q may report a uniform wage for its members who live in suburban convents and city convents in the United States, as the board, lodging, and perquisites furnished these members do not vary significantly from one convent to the other. Q may report another uniform wage (but not less than $100 per month apiece) for its members who are citizens of the United States and who reside in South America based on the fair market value of the perquisites furnished these individuals, as the fair market value of the perquisites furnished these individuals varies significantly from that of those furnished its members who live in its domestic convents but does not vary significantly among members in South America whose wages are subject to tax.</P>

For provisions relating to the collection of employee tax in respect of tips from the employee, see § 31.3102-3.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Tips not included for employer taxes.</E> Tips received after 1965 by an employee in the course of his employment do not constitute remuneration for employment for purposes of computing wages subject to the taxes imposed by subsections (a) and (b) of section 3111.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Tips received by an employee in course of his employment.</E> Tips are considered to be received by an employee in the course of his employment for an employer regardless of whether the tips are received by the employee from a person other than his employer or are paid to the employee by the employer. However, only those tips which are received by an employee on his own behalf (as distinguished from tips received on behalf of another employee) shall be considered as remuneration paid to the employee. Thus, where employees practice tip splitting (for example, where waiters pay a portion of the tips received by them to the busboys), each employee who receives a portion of a tip left by a customer of the employer is considered to have received tips in the course of his employment.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Computation of annual wage limitation.</E> In connection with the application of the annual wage limitation (see § 31.3121(a)(1)-1), tips reported by an employee to his employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a) shall be taken into account for purposes of the tax imposed by section 3101. However, since tips received by an employee in the course of his employment do not constitute remuneration for employment for purposes of the tax imposed by section 3111, they are disregarded for purposes of the annual wage limitation in respect of such tax. Accordingly, separate computations for purposes of the annual wage limitation may be required in respect of an employee who receives tips. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>During 1966, A is employed as a waiter by X restaurant and is paid wages by X restaurant at the rate of $100 a week. At the end of October 1966, A has been paid weekly wages in the amount of $4,300 and has reported tips in the amount of $2,200. On November 6, 1966, A is paid an additional week's wages in the amount of $100 and on November 9, 1966, A furnishes X restaurant a report of tips actually received by him during October. The annual wage limitation of $6,600 (weekly wages of $4,400 ($4,300 plus $100) and tips of $2,200) had been reached for purposes of the tax imposed by section 3101 prior to November 9 and, accordingly, no portion of the tips included in the report furnished on that date constitutes wages. However, since tips do not constitute remuneration for employment for purposes of the tax imposed by section 3111, the weekly wages paid to A during the remainder of 1966 will be subject to the tax imposed by section 3111.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Election of coverage by religious orders.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A religious order whose members are required to take a vow of poverty, or any autonomous subdivision of such an order, may elect to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act extended to services performed by its members in the exercise of duties required by such order or subdivision. See section 3121(i)(4) and § 31.3121(i)-4 for provisions relating to the computation of the amount of remuneration of such members. For purposes of this section, a subdivision of a religious order is autonomous if it directs and governs its members, if it is responsible for its members' care and maintenance, if it is responsible for the members' support and maintenance in retirement, and if the members live under the authority of a religious superior who is elected by them or appointed by higher authority.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of member</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of section 3121(r) and this section, a member of a religious order means any individual who is subject to a vow of poverty as a member of such order, who performs tasks usually required (and to the extent usually required) of an active member of such order, and who is not considered retired because of old age or total disability.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Retirement because of old age</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of section <PRTPAGE P="85"/>3121(r)(2) and this paragraph, an individual is considered retired because of old age if (A) in view of all the services performed by the individual and the surrounding circumstances it is reasonable to consider him to be retired, and (B) his retirement occurred by reason of old age. Even though an individual performs some services in the exercise of duties required by the religious order, the first test (the retirement test) is met where it is reasonable to consider the individual to be retired.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Factors to be considered.</E> In determining whether it is reasonable to consider an individual to be retired, consideration is first to be given to all of the following factors:</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Nature of services.</E> Consideration is given to the nature of the services performed by the individual in the exercise of duties required by his religious order. The more highly skilled and valuable such services are, the more likely the individual rendering such services is not reasonably considered retired. Also, whether such services are of a type performed principally by retired members of the individual's religious order may be significant.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Amount of time.</E> Consideration is also given to the amount of time the individual devotes to the performance of services in the exercise of duties required by his religious order. This time includes all the time spent by him in any activity in connection with services that might appropriately be performed in the exercise of duties required of active members by the order. Normally, an individual who, solely by reason of his advanced age, performs services of less than 45 hours per month shall be considered retired. In no event shall an individual who, solely by reason of his advanced age, performs services of less than 15 hours per month not be considered retired.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Comparison of services rendered before and after retirement.</E> In addition, consideration is given to the nature and extent of the services rendered by the individual before he “retired,” as compared with the services performed thereafter. A large reduction in the importance or amount of services performed by the individual in the exercise of duties required by his religious order tends to show that the individual is retired; absence of such reduction tends to show that the individual is not retired. Normally, an individual who reduces by at least 75 percent the amount of services performed shall be considered retired.</P>
                <FP>Where consideration of the factors described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section does not establish whether an individual is or is not reasonably considered retired, all other factors are considered.</FP>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The rules of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>A is a member of a religious order who is subject to a vow of poverty. A's religious order is principally engaged in providing nursing services, and A has been fully trained in the nursing profession. In accordance with the practices of her order, upon attaining the age of 65, A is relieved of her nursing duties by reason of her age, and is assigned to a mother house where she is required to perform only such duties as light housekeeping and ordinary gardening. A is reasonably considered retired since the services she is performing are simple in nature, are markedly less skilled than those professional services which she previously performed, are of a type performed principally by retired members of her order, and are performed at a location to which members frequently retire.</P>

                  <P>Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that A is not reassigned to a mother house. Instead, she is reassigned to full-time duties in a hospital not utilizing her nursing skills. Whether A has met the retirement test requires consideration of the nature of her work. If A's new duties are almost entirely of a make-work nature primarily to occupy her body and mind, she is reasonably considered retired. However, if they are essential to the operation of the hospital, she is not reasonably considered retired.</P>

By reason of having attained the age of 62, he reduces the number of hours spent per day in these services from 8 hours to 2 hours. B is reasonably considered retired in view of the large reduction in the amount of time he devotes to his duties.</P>

Upon attaining the age of 65, C is relieved of his duties as president of the university and instead becomes a member of its faculty, <PRTPAGE P="86"/>teaching two courses whereas full-time members of the faculty normally teach four comparable courses. Although C's duties are no longer as demanding as those he previously performed, and although the amount of his time required for them is less than full time, he is nonetheless performing duties requiring a high degree of skill for a substantial amount of time. Accordingly, C is not reasonably considered retired.</P>

                <P>(3) <E T="03">Retirement because of total disability.</E> For purposes of section 3121(r)(2) and this paragraph, an individual is considered retired because of total disability (i) if he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to perform the tasks usually required of an active member of his order to the extent necessary to maintain his status as an active member, and (ii) if such impairment is reasonably expected to prevent his resumption of the performance of such tasks to such extent. A physical or mental impairment is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. Statements of the individual, including his own description of his impairment (symptoms), are, alone, insufficient to establish the presence of a physical or mental impairment.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Evidentiary requirements with respect to retirement.</E> There shall be attached to the return of taxes paid pursuant to an election under section 3121(r) a summary of the facts upon which any determination has been made by the religious order or autonomous subdivision that one or more of its members retired during the period covered by such return. Each summary shall contain the name and social security number of each such retired member as well as the date of his retirement. Such order or subdivision shall maintain records of the details relating to each such “retirement” sufficient to show whether or not such member or members has in fact retired.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Certificates of election</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A religious order or an autonomous subdivision of such an order desiring to make an election of coverage pursuant to section 3121(r) and this section shall file a certificate of election on Form SS-16 in accordance with the instructions thereto. However, in the case of an election made before August 9, 1973, a document other than Form SS-16 shall constitute a certificate of election if it purports to be a binding election of coverage and if it is filed with an appropriate official of the Internal Revenue Service. Such a document shall be given the effect it would have if it were a certificate of election containing the provisions required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, it should subsequently be supplemented by a Form SS-16.</P>

                <P>(ii) Such election shall apply to all current and future members of such order, or in the case of a subdivision thereof to all current and future members of such order who belong to such subdivision,</P>
                <P>(iii) All services performed by a member of such order or subdivision in the exercise of duties required by such order or subdivision shall be deemed to have been performed by such member as an employee of such order or subdivision, and</P>

                <P>(iv) The wages of each member, upon which such order or subdivision shall pay the taxes imposed on employees and employers by sections 3101 and 3111, will be determined as provided in section 3121(i)(4).<PRTPAGE P="87"/>

                <P>(i) The first day of the calendar quarter in which the certificate is filed,</P>
                <P>(ii) The first day of the calendar quarter immediately following the quarter in which the certificate is filed, or</P>
                <P>(iii) The first day of any calendar quarter preceding the calendar quarter in which the certificate is filed, except that such date may not be earlier than the first day of the 20th calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which such certificate is filed.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Retroactive elections.</E> Whenever a date is designated as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the election shall apply to services performed before the quarter in which the certificate is filed only if the member performing such services was a member at the time such services were performed and is living on the first day of the quarter in which such certificate is filed. Thus, the election applies to an individual who is no longer a member of a religious order on the first day of such quarter if he performed services as a member at any time on or after the date so designated and is living on the first day of the quarter in which such certificate is filed. For purposes of computing interest and for purposes of section 6651 (relating to additions to tax for failure to file tax return or to pay tax), in any case in which such a date is designated the due date for the return and payment of the tax, for calendar quarters prior to the quarter in which the certificate is filed, resulting from the filing of such certificate shall be the last day of the calendar month following the calendar quarter in which the certificate is filed. The statutory period for the assessment of the tax for such prior calendar quarters shall not expire before the expiration of 3 years from such due date.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Concurrent employment by related corporations with common paymaster.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of sections 3102, 3111, and 3121(a)(1), except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, when two or more related corporations concurrently employ the same individual and compensate that individual through a common paymaster which is one of the related corporations that employs the individual, each of the corporations is considered to have paid only the remuneration it actually disburses to that individual. This rule applies whether the remuneration was paid with respect to the employment relationship of the individual with the disbursing corporation or was paid on behalf of another related corporation. Accordingly, if all of the remuneration to the individual from the related corporations is disbursed through the common paymaster, the total amount of taxes imposed with respect to the remuneration under sections 3102 and 3111 is determined as though the individual has only one employer (the common paymaster). The common paymaster is responsible for filing information and tax returns and issuing Forms W-2 with respect to wages it is considered to have paid under this section. Section 3121(s) and this section apply only to remuneration disbursed in the form of money, check or similar instrument by one of the related corporations or its agent.</P>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Related corporations.</E> Corporations shall be considered related corporations for an entire calendar quarter (as defined in § 31.0-2(a)(9)) if they satisfy any one of the following four tests at any time during that calendar quarter:</P>

                <P>(i) The corporations are members of a “controlled group of corporations”, as defined in section 1563 of the Code, or would be members if section 1563(a)(4) <PRTPAGE P="88"/>and (b) did not apply and if the phrase “more than 50 percent” were substituted for the phrase “at least 80 percent” wherever it appears in section 1563(a).</P>
                <P>(ii) In the case of a corporation that does not issue stock, either fifty percent or more of the members of one corporation's board of directors (or other governing body) are members of the other corporation's board of directors (or other governing body), or the holders of fifty percent or more of the voting power to select such members are concurrently the holders of more than fifty percent of that power with respect to the other corporation.</P>
                <P>(iii) Fifty percent or more of one corporation's officers are concurrently officers of the other corporation.</P>
                <P>(iv) Thirty percent or more of one corporation's employees are concurrently employees of the other corporation.</P>
                <FP>The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph:</FP>

X Corporation is the paymaster for all thirteen individuals. The corporations have no officers or stockholders in common.</P>
                  <P>(b) X and Y are related corporations because at least 30 percent of Y's employees are also employees of X. Y and Z are related corporations because at least 30 percent of Y's employees are also employees of Z. X and Z are not related corporations because neither corporation has 30 percent of its employees concurrently employed by the other corporation.</P>
                  <P>(c) For purposes of determining the amount of the tax liability under sections 3102 and 3111, individual B is treated as having one employer. Individual C has two employers for these purposes, although Y and Z are related corporations, because C is not employed by X Corporation, the common paymaster. Individual A also is treated as having two employers for the purposes of these sections because X and Y Corporations are treated as one employer, and Z Corporation is treated as a second employer (since it is not related to the paymaster, X Corporation). Of course, individuals D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M are not concurrently employed by two or more corporations, and, accordingly, section 3121 (s) is inapplicable to them.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Common paymaster</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A common paymaster of a group of related corporations is any member thereof that disburses remuneration to employees of two or more of those corporations on their behalf and that is responsible for keeping books and records for the payroll with respect to those employees. The common paymaster is not required to disburse remuneration to all the employees of those two or more related corporations, but the provisions of this section do not apply to any remuneration to an employee that is not disbursed through a common paymaster. The common <PRTPAGE P="89"/>paymaster may pay concurrently employed individuals under this section by one combined paycheck, drawn on a single bank account, or by separate paychecks, drawn by the common paymaster on the accounts of one or more employing corporations.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Multiple common paymasters.</E> A group of related corporations may have more than one common paymaster. Some of the related corporations may use one common paymaster and others of the related corporations use another common paymaster with respect to a certain class of employees. A corporation that uses a common paymaster to disburse remuneration to certain of its employees may use a different common paymaster to disburse remuneration to other employees.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The rules of this subparagraph are illustrated by the following examples:

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>S, T, U, and V are related corporations with 2,000 employees collectively. Forty of these employees are concurrently employed by two or more of the corporations, during a calendar quarter. The four corporations arrange for S to disburse remuneration to thirty of these forty employees for their services. Under these facts, S is the common paymaster of S, T, U, and V with respect to the thirty employees. S is not a common paymaster with respect to the remaining employees.</P>

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>(a) W, X, Y, and Z are related corporations. The corporations collectively have 20,000 employees. Two hundred of the employees are top-level executives and managers, sixty of whom are concurrently employed by two or more of the corporations during a calendar quarter. Six thousand of the employees are skilled artisans, all of whom are concurrently employed by two or more of the corporations during the calendar year. The four corporations arrange for Z to disburse remuneration to the sixty executives who are concurrently employed by two or more of the corporations. W and X arrange for X to disburse remuneration to the artisans who are concurrently employed by W and X.</P>
                  <P>(b) A is an executive who is concurrently employed only by W, Y, and Z during the calendar year. Under these facts, Z is a common paymaster for W, Y, and Z with respect to A. Assuming that the other requirements of this section are met, the amount of the tax liability under sections 3102 and 3111 is determined as if Z were A's only employer for the calendar quarter.</P>
                  <P>(c) B is a skilled artisan who is concurrently employed only by W and X during the calendar year. Under these facts, X is a common paymaster for S and X with respect to B. Assuming that the other requirements of this section are met, the amount of the tax liability under sections 3102 and 3111 is determined as if X were B's only employer for the calendar quarter.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Concurrent employment.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “concurrent employment” means the contemporaneous existence of an employment relationship (within the meaning of section 3121(b)) between an individual and two or more corporations. Such a relationship contemplates the performance of services by the employee for the benefit of the employing corporation (not merely for the benefit of the group of corporations), in exchange for remuneration which, if deductible for the purposes of Federal income tax, would be deductible by the employing corporation. The contemporaneous existence of an employment relationship with each corporation is the decisive factor; if it exists, the fact that a particular employee is on leave or otherwise temporarily inactive is immaterial. However, employment is not concurrent with respect to one of the related corporations if the employee's employment relationship with that corporation is completely nonexistent during periods when the employee is not performing services for that corporation. An employment relationship is completely nonexistent if all rights and obligations of the employer and employee with respect to employment have terminated, other than those that customarily exist after employment relationships terminate. Examples of rights and obligations that customarily exist after employment relationships terminate include those with respect to remuneration not yet paid, employer's property used by the employee not yet returned to the employer, severance pay, and lump-sum termination payments from a deferred compensation plan. Circumstances that suggest that an employment relationship has become completely nonexistent include unconditional termination of participation in deferred compensation plans of the employer, forfeiture of seniority claims, and forfeiture of unused fringe benefits such as vacation or sick pay. Of course, the continued existence of an employment <PRTPAGE P="90"/>relationship between an individual and a corporation is not necessarily established by the individual's continued participation in a deferred compensation plan, retention of seniority rights, etc., since continuation of those benefits may be attributable to employment with a second corporation related to the first corporation if the corporations have common benefits plans or if the benefits are continued as a matter of corporate reciprocity. An individual who does not perform substantial services in exchange for remuneration from a corporation is presumed not employed by that corporation. Concurrent employment need not exist for any particular length of time to meet the requirements of this section, but this section only applies to remuneration disbursed by a common paymaster to an individual who is concurrently employed by the common paymaster and at least one other related corporation at the time the individual performs the services for which the remuneration is paid. If the employment relationship is nonexistent during a quarter, that employee may not be counted towards the 30-percent test set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section; however, even if the employment relationship is nonexistent, section 3121(s) of the Code would apply to remuneration paid to the former employee for services rendered while the employee was a common employee. The principles of this subparagraph are illustrated by the following examples.
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>M, N, and O are related corporations which use N as a common paymaster with respect to officers. Their respective headquarters are located in three separate cities several hundred miles apart. A is an officer of M, N, and O who performs substantial services for each corporation. A does not work a set length of time at each corporate headquarters, and when A leaves one corporate headquarters, it is not known when A will return, although it is expected that A will return. Under these facts, A is concurrently employed by the three corporations.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>P, Q, and R are related corporations whose geographical zones of business activity do not overlap. P, Q, and R have a common pension plan and arrange for Q to be a common paymaster for managers and executives. All three corporations maintain cafeterias for the use of their employees. B is a cafeteria manager who has worked at P's headquarters for 3 years. On June 1, 1980, B is transferred from P to the position of cafeteria manager of R. There are no plans for B's return to P. B's accrued pension benefits, vacation and sick pay, do not change as a result of the transfer. The decision to transfer B was made by Q, the parent corporation. Under these facts, B is not concurrently employed by P and R, because B's employment relationship with P was completely nonexistent during B's employment with R. Furthermore, section 3121(s) is inapplicable since B also was not employed by Q, the common paymaster, because B never contracted to perform services for remuneration from Q, and Q did not have the right to control the day-to-day duties of B's work.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
                  <P>C is employed by two related corporations, S and T. C was concurrently employed by these corporations between April 1, 1979, and June 30, 1979. The corporations used T as the common paymaster with respect to C's wages between May 1, 1979, and September 30, 1979. T pays C on May 15 for services performed between April 1 and April 30, on July 15 for services performed between June 1 and June 30, and on August 15 for services performed between July 1 and July 31. Section 3121 (s) applies to the first two payments but does not apply to the third payment (there was no concurrent employment). However, if the third payment was made by T for services performed for T, T counts the amounts previously disbursed to C in 1979 while C was concurrently employed by S and T towards the wage base (see section 3121 (a)(1)).</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Allocation of employment taxes</E>—(1) <E T="03">Responsibility to pay tax.</E> If the requirements of this section are met, the common paymaster has the primary responsibility for remitting taxes pursuant to sections 3102 and 3111 with respect to the remuneration it disburses as the common paymaster. The common paymaster computes these taxes as though it were the sole employer of the concurrently employed individuals. If the common paymaster fails to remit these taxes (in whole or in part), it remains liable for the full amount of the unpaid portion of these taxes. In addition, each of the other related corporations using the common paymaster is jointly and severally liable for its appropriate share of these taxes. That share is an amount equal to the lesser of:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount of the liability of the common paymaster under section 3121(s), after taking account of any tax payments made, or</P>

                <P>(ii) The amount of the liability under sections 3102 and 3111 which, but for <PRTPAGE P="91"/>section 3121(s), would have existed with respect to the remuneration from such other related corporation, reduced by an allocable portion of any taxes previously paid by the common paymaster with respect to that remuneration.</P>
                <FP>The portion of taxes previously paid by the common paymaster that is allocable to each related corporation is determined by multiplying the amount of taxes paid by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the amount of employment tax liability of the common paymaster under section 3121(s) that is allocable to such related corporation under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the common paymaster's liability under section 3121(s), both determined without regard to any prior tax payments. These rules apply whether or not the tax on employees was withheld from the employees' wages.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Allocation of tax</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the related corporations maintain a record of the remuneration disbursed to the employee for services performed for each corporation, the remuneration-based allocation rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section apply. If the related corporations do not maintain this record of remuneration, the group-wide allocation rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section apply. In all cases, allocations must be made with respect to each payment of wages. The allocation of employment tax liabilities pursuant to this subparagraph also determines which related corporation may be entitled to income tax deductions with respect to the payments of those taxes.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Remuneration-based allocation rules.</E> Under the remuneration-based method of allocation, each related corporation that remunerates an employee through a common paymaster has allocated to it for each pay period an amount of tax determined according to the following formula:</P>

                  <P>(ii) If Y remits none of the taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, X is liable for $2,452.00 (the entire amount due pursuant to sections 3102 and 3111 with respect to the remuneration to A from X) (12.26% × $20,000). Any amount remitted by X to the Internal Revenue Service under these circumstances is also credited against the liability of the common paymaster, Y. However, only the portion of the employment taxes allocated to X under (i) above may be deducted by X as employment taxes paid by it in respect of wages paid by it to its employees.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If Y remits $1,000.00 of the total $2,807.54 due, Y as common paymaster remains liable for $1,807.54 ($2,807.54 minus $1,000). X's liability is the lesser of $1,807.54 (the liability of the common paymaster), or X's total liability, in the absence of section 3121 (s), on wages paid through the common paymaster ($2,452.00) minus a credit for an allocable part of the amount remitted by Y. The part is $412.66</P>

                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Group-wide allocation rules.</E> Under the group-wide method of allocation, the Commissioner may allocate the taxes imposed by sections 3102 and 3111 in an appropriate manner to a related corporation that remunerates an employee through a common paymaster if the common paymaster fails to remit the taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. Allocation in an appropriate manner varies according to the circumstances. It may be based on sales, property, corporate payroll, or any other basis that reflects the distribution of the services performed by the employee, or a combination of the foregoing bases. To the extent practicable, the Commissioner may use the principles of § 1.482-2(b) of this chapter in making the allocations with respect to wages paid after December 31, 1978, and on or before July 31, 2009. To the extent practicable, the Commissioner may use the principles of § 1.482-9 of this chapter in making the allocations with respect to wages paid after July 31, 2009.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Treatment of amounts deferred under certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Timing of wage inclusion</E>—(1) <E T="03">General timing rule for wages.</E> Remuneration for employment that constitutes wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) generally is taken into account for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes imposed under sections 3101 and 3111 at the time the remuneration is actually or constructively paid. See § 31.3121(a)-2(a).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Special timing rule for an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> To the extent that remuneration deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan constitutes wages within the meaning of section 3121(a), the remuneration is subject to the special timing rule described in this paragraph (a)(2). Remuneration is considered deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2) and this section only if it is provided pursuant to a plan described in paragraph (b) of this section. The amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is determined under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Special timing rule.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is required to be taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes as of the later of—</P>
                <P>(A) The date on which the services creating the right to that amount are performed (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section); or</P>
                <P>(B) The date on which the right to that amount is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Inclusion in wages only once (nonduplication rule).</E> Once an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is taken into account (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section), then neither the amount taken into account nor the income attributable to the amount taken into account (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section) is treated as wages for FICA tax purposes at any time thereafter.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Benefits that do not result from a deferral of compensation.</E> If a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) provides both a benefit that results from the deferral of compensation (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section) and a benefit that does not result from the deferral of compensation, the benefit that does not result from the deferral of compensation is not subject to the special timing rule described in this paragraph (a)(2). For example, if a nonqualified deferred compensation plan provides retirement benefits which result from the deferral of compensation and disability pay (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C) of this section) which does not result from the deferral of compensation, the retirement benefits provided under the plan are subject to the special timing rule in this paragraph (a)(2) and the disability pay is not.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Remuneration that does not constitute wages.</E> If remuneration under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a), then that remuneration is not taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes under either the general timing rule described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the special timing rule described in this paragraph (a)(2). For example, benefits under a death benefit plan described in section 3121(a)(13) do not constitute wages for FICA tax purposes. Therefore, these benefits are not included as wages under the general timing rule described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the special timing rule described in this paragraph (a)(2), even if the death benefit plan would otherwise be considered a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonqualified deferred compensation plan</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of <PRTPAGE P="94"/>this section, the term <E T="03">nonqualified deferred compensation plan</E> means any plan or other arrangement, other than a plan described in section 3121(a)(5), that is established (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section) by an employer for one or more of its employees, and that provides for the deferral of compensation (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section). A nonqualified deferred compensation plan may be adopted unilaterally by the employer or may be negotiated among or agreed to by the employer and one or more employees or employee representatives. A plan may constitute a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under this section without regard to whether the deferrals under the plan are made pursuant to an election by the employee or whether the amounts deferred are treated as deferred compensation for income tax purposes (e.g., whether the amounts are subject to the deduction rules of section 404). In addition, a plan may constitute a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under this section whether or not it is an employee benefit plan under section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended (29 U.S.C. 1002(3)). For purposes of this section, except where the context indicates otherwise, the <E T="03">term</E> plan includes a plan or other arrangement.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Plan establishment</E>—(i) <E T="03">Date plan is established.</E> For purposes of this section, a plan is established on the latest of the date on which it is adopted, the date on which it is effective, and the date on which the material terms of the plan are set forth in writing. For purposes of this section, a plan will be deemed to be set forth in writing if it is set forth in any other form that is approved by the Commissioner. The material terms of the plan include the amount (or the method or formula for determining the amount) of deferred compensation to be provided under the plan and the time when it may or will be provided.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Plan amendments.</E> In the case of an amendment that increases the amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the plan is not considered established with respect to the additional amount deferred until the plan, as amended, is established in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Transition rule for written plan requirement.</E> For purposes of this section, an unwritten plan that was adopted and effective before March 25, 1996, is treated as established under this section as of the later of the date on which it was adopted or became effective, provided that the material terms of the plan are set forth in writing before January 1, 2000.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Plan must provide for the deferral of compensation</E>—(i) <E T="03">Deferral of compensation defined.</E> A plan provides for the <E T="03">deferral of compensation</E> with respect to an employee only if, under the terms of the plan and the relevant facts and circumstances, the employee has a legally binding right during a calendar year to compensation that has not been actually or constructively received and that, pursuant to the terms of the plan, is payable to (or on behalf of) the employee in a later year. An employee does not have a legally binding right to compensation if that compensation may be unilaterally reduced or eliminated by the employer after the services creating the right to the compensation have been performed. For this purpose, compensation is not considered subject to unilateral reduction or elimination merely because it may be reduced or eliminated by operation of the objective terms of the plan, such as the application of an objective provision creating a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of section 83). Similarly, an employee does not fail to have a legally binding right to compensation merely because the amount of compensation is determined under a formula that provides for benefits to be offset by benefits provided under a plan that is qualified under section 401(a), or because benefits are reduced due to investment losses or, in a final average pay plan, subsequent decreases in compensation.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Compensation payable pursuant to the employer's customary payment timing arrangement.</E> There is no deferral of compensation (within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(3)) merely because compensation is paid after the last day <PRTPAGE P="95"/>of a calendar year pursuant to the timing arrangement under which the employer ordinarily compensates employees for services performed during a payroll period described in section 3401(b).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Short-term deferrals.</E> If, under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, there is a deferral of compensation (within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(3)) that causes an amount to be deferred from a calendar year to a date that is not more than a brief period of time after the end of that calendar year, then, at the employer's option, that amount may be treated as if it were not subject to the special timing rule described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An employer may apply this option only if the employer does so for all employees covered by the plan and all substantially similar nonqualified deferred compensation plans. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii), whether compensation is deferred to a date that is not more than a brief period of time after the end of a calendar year is determined in accordance with § 1.404(b)-1T, Q&amp;A-2, of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Plans, arrangements, and benefits that do not provide for the deferral of compensation</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an amount or benefit described in any of paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) through (viii) of this section is not treated as resulting from the deferral of compensation for purposes of section 3121(v)(2) and this section and, thus, is not subject to the special timing rule of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other stock value rights.</E> The grant of a stock option, stock appreciation right, or other stock value right does not constitute the deferral of compensation for purposes of section 3121(v)(2). In addition, amounts received as a result of the exercise of a stock option, stock appreciation right, or other stock value right do not result from the deferral of compensation for purposes of section 3121(v)(2) if such amounts are actually or constructively received in the calendar year of the exercise. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), a <E T="03">stock value right</E> is a right granted to an employee with respect to one or more shares of employer stock that, to the extent exercised, entitles the employee to a payment for each share of stock equal to the excess, or a percentage of the excess, of the value of a share of the employer's stock on the date of exercise over a specified price (greater than zero).</P>
                <P>Thus, for example, the term stock value right does not include a phantom stock or other arrangement under which an employee is awarded the right to receive a fixed payment equal to the value of a specified number of shares of employer stock.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Restricted property.</E> If an employee receives property from, or pursuant to, a plan maintained by an employer, there is no deferral of compensation (within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2)) merely because the value of the property is not includible in income (under section 83) in the year of receipt by reason of the property being nontransferable and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. However, a plan under which an employee obtains a legally binding right to receive property (whether or not the property is restricted property) in a future year may provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and, accordingly, may constitute a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, even though benefits under the plan are or may be paid in the form of property.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Certain welfare benefits</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> Vacation benefits, sick leave, compensatory time, disability pay, severance pay, and death benefits do not result from the deferral of compensation for purposes of section 3121(v)(2), even if those benefits constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a).</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Severance pay.</E> Benefits that are provided under a severance pay arrangement (within the meaning of section 3(2)(B)(i) of ERISA) that satisfies the conditions in 29 CFR 2510.3-2(b)(1)(i) through (iii) are considered severance pay for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv). If benefits are provided under a severance pay arrangement (within the meaning of section 3(2)(B)(i) of ERISA), but do not satisfy one or more of the conditions in 29 CFR 2510.3-2(b)(1)(i) through (iii), then whether those benefits are severance <PRTPAGE P="96"/>pay within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv) depends upon the relevant facts and circumstances. For this purpose, relevant facts and circumstances include whether the benefits are provided over a short period of time commencing immediately after (or shortly after) termination of employment or for a substantial period of time following termination of employment and whether the benefits are provided after any termination or only after retirement (or another specified type of termination). Benefits provided under a severance pay arrangement (within the meaning of section 3(2)(B)(i) of ERISA) are in all cases severance pay within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv) if the benefits payable under the plan upon an employee's termination of employment are payable only if that termination is involuntary.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Death benefits and disability pay</E>—(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">General definition.</E> Payments made under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in the event of death are death benefits within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv), but only to the extent the total benefits payable under the plan exceed the lifetime benefits payable under the plan. Similarly, payments made under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in the event of disability are disability pay within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv), but only to the extent the disability benefits payable under the plan exceed the lifetime benefits payable under the plan. Accordingly, any benefits that a nonqualified deferred compensation plan provides in the event of death or disability that are associated with an amount deferred under this section are disregarded in applying this section to the extent the benefits payable under the plan in the event of death or in the event of disability have a value in excess of the lifetime benefits payable under the plan.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Total benefits payable defined.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, the term <E T="03">total benefits payable</E> under a plan means the present value of the total benefits payable to or on behalf of the employee (including benefits payable in the event of the employee's death) under the plan, disregarding any benefits that are payable only in the event of disability and determined separately with respect to each form of distribution or other election that may apply with respect to the employee.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Disability benefits payable defined.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, the term <E T="03">disability benefits payable</E> under a plan means the present value of the benefits payable to or on behalf of the employee under the plan, including benefits payable in the event of the employee's disability but excluding death benefits within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) <E T="03">Lifetime benefits payable defined.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, the term <E T="03">lifetime benefits payable</E> under a plan means the present value of the benefits that could be payable to the employee under the plan during the employee's lifetime, determined under the plan's optional form of distribution or other election that is or was available to the employee at any time with respect to the amount deferred and that provides the largest present value to the employee during the employee's lifetime of any such form or election so available.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) <E T="03">Rules of application.</E> For purposes of determining present value under this paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C), present value is determined as of the time immediately preceding the time the amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is required to be taken into account under paragraph (e) of this section, using actuarial assumptions that are reasonable as of that date but taking into consideration only benefits that result from the deferral of compensation, as determined under this paragraph (b), and benefits payable in the event of death or disability. In addition, for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section, present value must be determined without any discount for the probability that the employee may die before benefit payments commence and without regard to any benefits payable solely in the event of disability.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Certain benefits provided in connection with impending termination</E>—(A) <E T="03">In <PRTPAGE P="97"/>general.</E> Benefits provided in connection with impending termination of employment under paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B) or (C) of this section do not result from the deferral of compensation within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2).</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Window benefits</E>—(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(v), except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section, a window benefit is provided in connection with impending termination of employment. For this purpose, a window benefit is an early retirement benefit, retirement-type subsidy, social security supplement, or other form of benefit made available by an employer for a limited period of time (no greater than one year) to employees who terminate employment during that period or to employees who terminate employment during that period under specified circumstances.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Special rule for recurring window benefits.</E> A benefit will not be considered a window benefit if an employer establishes a pattern of repeatedly providing for similar benefits in similar situations for substantially consecutive, limited periods of time. Whether the recurrence of these benefits constitutes a pattern of amendments is determined based on the facts and circumstances. Although no one factor is determinative, relevant factors include whether the benefits are on account of a specific business event or condition, the degree to which the benefits relate to the event or condition, and whether the event or condition is temporary or discrete or is a permanent aspect of the employer's business.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Transition rule for window benefits.</E> In the case of a window benefit that is made available for a period of time that begins before January 1, 2000, an employer may choose to treat the window benefit as a benefit that results from the deferral of compensation if the sole reason the window benefit would otherwise fail to be provided pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is the application of paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">C</E>) <E T="03">Termination within 12 months of establishment of a benefit or plan.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(v), a benefit is provided in connection with impending termination of employment, without regard to whether it constitutes a window benefit, if—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An employee's termination of employment occurs within 12 months of the establishment of the plan (or amendment) providing the benefit; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The facts and circumstances indicate that the plan (or amendment) is established in contemplation of the employee's impending termination of employment.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Benefits established after termination.</E> Benefits established with respect to an employee after the employee's termination of employment do not result from a deferral of compensation within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2). However, cost-of-living adjustments on benefit payments under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) shall not be considered benefits established after the employee's termination of employment for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(vi) merely because the employee does not obtain the right to the adjustment until after the employee's termination of employment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, <E T="03">cost-of-living adjustments</E> are payments that satisfy conditions similar to those of 29 CFR 2510.3-2(g)(1)(ii) and (iii).</P>
                <P>(vii) <E T="03">Excess parachute payments.</E> An excess parachute payment (as defined in section 280G(b)) under an agreement entered into or renewed after June 14, 1984, in taxable years ending after such date, does not result from the deferral of compensation within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2). For this purpose, any contract entered into before June 15, 1984, that is amended after June 14, 1984, in any relevant significant aspect, is treated as a contract entered into after June 14, 1984.</P>
                <P>(viii) <E T="03">Compensation for current services.</E> A plan does not provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2) if, based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the compensation is paid for current services.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Examples.</E> This paragraph (b) is illustrated by the following examples:

Because Employee A meets the specified goals, Employer L pays the bonus to Employee A on July 1, 2003, consistent with its oral commitment.</P>
                  <P>(ii) This arrangement is not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under this section because its terms were not set forth in writing and, therefore, it was not established in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(i) In 2002, Employer O, a state or local government, establishes a plan for certain employees that provides for the deferral of compensation and that is subject to section 457(a).</P>
                  <P>(ii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section provides that nonqualified deferred compensation plan means any plan that is established by an employer and that provides for the deferral of compensation, other than a plan described in section 3121(a)(5). Section 3121(a)(5) lists, among other plans, an exempt governmental deferred compensation plan as defined in section 3121(v)(3). Under section 3121(v)(3)(A), this definition does not include any plan to which section 457(a) applies. Thus, the plan established by Employer O is not an exempt governmental deferred compensation plan described in section 3121(v)(3) and, consequently, is not a plan described in section 3121(a)(5). Accordingly, the plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(iii) However, the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the special timing rule of paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply only to remuneration for employment that constitutes wages. Under section 3121(b)(7), certain service performed in the employ of a state, or any political subdivision of a state, is not employment. Thus, even though the plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the extent to which section 3121(v)(2) applies to a participating employee will depend on whether or not the service performed for Employer O is excluded from the definition of employment under section 3121(b)(7).</P>

                  <P>(i) In 2000, Employer P establishes a plan that provides for bonuses to be paid to employees based on an objective formula that takes into account the employees' performance for the year. Employer P does not have the discretion to reduce the amount of any employee's bonus after the end of the year. The bonus is not actually calculated until March 1 of the following year, and is paid on March 15 of that following year.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The plan provides for the deferral of compensation because the employees have a legally binding right, as of the last day of a calendar year, to an amount of compensation that has not been actually or constructively received and, pursuant to the terms of the plan, that compensation is payable in a later year. However, because the bonuses under the plan are paid within a brief period of time after the end of the calendar year from which they are deferred, Employer P may choose, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, to treat all the bonuses as if they are not subject to the special timing rule of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If the employer uses the special timing rule, the amount deferred would be taken into account as wages on December 31, 2000. If the employer chooses not to use the special timing rule, the amount of the bonus is wages on the date it is actually or constructively paid, March 15, 2000.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Because an employee does not have a legally binding right to any bonus until January of the year in which the bonus is paid, any bonus paid under the plan in that year is not deferred from the preceding calendar year, and the plan does not provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer R maintains a plan for employees that provides nonqualified stock options described in § 1.83-7(a) of this chapter. Under the plan, employees are granted in 2001 the option to acquire shares of employer stock at the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant ($50 per share). The options can be exercised at any time from the date of grant through 2010. The options do not have a readily ascertainable fair market value for purposes of section 83 at the date of grant, and shares are issued upon the exercise of the options without being subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section 83. In 2005, when the fair market value of a share of employer stock is $80, Employee D exercises an option to acquire 1,000 shares.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, neither the grant of a stock option nor amounts received currently as a result of the exercise of a stock option result from the deferral of compensation for purposes of section 3121(v)(2). Thus, under the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the $30,000 spread between the amount paid for the shares ($50,000) and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise ($80,000) is taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes in the year of exercise.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If the options had been granted at $45 per share, $5 per share below the fair market value on date of grant, the $35,000 spread between the amount paid for the shares ($45,000) and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise ($80,000) would similarly be taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes in the year of exercise.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Because compensation to which the employee has a legally binding right as of the last day of one year is paid in a subsequent year, the phantom stock plan provides for the deferral of compensation. The phantom stock plan does not provide stock value rights within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section because it provides for awards equal in value to the full fair market value of a specified number of shares of Employer T stock, rather than the excess of that fair market value over a specified price.</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer V establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which employees will receive benefit payments commencing at age 65 as a life annuity or in one of several actuarially equivalent annuity forms. If an employee dies before benefit payments commence under the plan, a benefit is payable to the employee's designated beneficiary in a single lump sum payment equal to the present value of the employee's annuity benefit. This benefit (sometimes called a full reserve death benefit) is calculated using the applicable interest rate specified in section 417(e) and, for the period after age 65, the applicable mortality table specified in section 417(e), both of which are reasonable actuarial assumptions. During 2002, Employee E obtains a legally binding right to an annuity benefit under the plan, payable at age 65. This annuity benefit has a present value of $10,000 at the end of 2002, determined using the same assumptions as are used under the plan to calculate the full reserve death benefit.</P>

                  <P>(ii) The present value, at the end of 2002, of the total benefits payable to or on behalf of Employee E (i.e., the sum of the present value of the annuity benefit commencing at age 65, and the present value of the full reserve death benefit, with both determined using the actuarial assumptions described in paragraph (i) of this <E T="03">Example 10,</E> except also taking into account the probability of death prior to age 65) is $10,000. This present value does not exceed the present value of the annuity benefits that could be payable to Employee E under the plan during Employee E's lifetime determined without a discount for the possibility that Employee E might die before age 65 (also $10,000). Thus, the benefit payable in the event of Employee E's death is not a death benefit for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(iii) The same result would apply in the case of a plan that bases benefits on an interest bearing account balance and pays the account balance at termination of employment or death (because the sum of the deferred benefits payable in the future if the employee terminates employment before death with a discount for the probability of death before that date plus the present value of the <PRTPAGE P="100"/>benefit payable in the event of death necessarily equals the present value of the deferred benefits payable with no discount for the probability of death).</P>

Employee E is age 63 and has a spouse who is age 51. The sum of the present value of Employee E's annuity benefit commencing at age 65 determined with a discount for the possibility that Employee E might die before age 65 and the present value of the 100 percent annuity death benefit for Employee E's spouse exceeds $10,000.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The amount deferred for 2002 is $10,000 (because the 100 percent annuity death benefit for Employee E's spouse is disregarded to the extent that the total benefits payable to or on behalf of Employee E exceeds the present value of the annuity benefits that could be payable to Employee E under the plan during Employee E's lifetime without a discount for the probability of Employee E's death before benefit payments commence).</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of the amount deferred</E>—(1) <E T="03">Account balance plans</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> For purposes of this section, if benefits for an employee are provided under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is an account balance plan, the amount deferred for a period equals the principal amount credited to the employee's account for <PRTPAGE P="101"/>the period, increased or decreased by any income attributable to the principal amount through the date the principal amount is required to be taken into account as wages under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(A) <E T="03">Account balance plan.</E> For purposes of this section, an account balance plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under the terms of which a principal amount (or amounts) is credited to an individual account for an employee, the income attributable to each principal amount is credited (or debited) to the individual account, and the benefits payable to the employee are based solely on the balance credited to the individual account.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Income.</E> For purposes of this section, <E T="03">income</E> means any increase or decrease in the amount credited to an employee's account that is attributable to amounts previously credited to the employee's account, regardless of whether the plan denominates that increase or decrease as income.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Additional rules</E>—(A) <E T="03">Commingled accounts.</E> A plan does not fail to be an account balance plan merely because, under the terms of the plan, benefits payable to an employee are based solely on a specified percentage of an account maintained for all (or a portion of) plan participants under which principal amounts and income are credited (or debited) to such account.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Bifurcation permitted.</E> An employer may treat a portion of a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as a separate account balance plan if that portion satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1) and the amount payable to employees under that portion is determined independently of the amount payable under the other portion of the plan.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Actuarial equivalents.</E> A plan does not fail to be an account balance plan merely because the plan permits employees to elect to receive their benefits under the plan in a form of benefit other than payment of the account balance, provided the amount of benefit payable in that other form is actuarially equivalent to payment of the account balance using actuarial assumptions that are reasonable. Conversely, a plan is not an account balance plan if it provides an optional form of benefit that is not actuarially equivalent to the account balance using actuarial assumptions that are reasonable. For this purpose, the determination of whether forms are actuarially equivalent using actuarial assumptions that are reasonable is determined under the rules applicable to nonaccount balance plans under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Nonaccount balance plans</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> For purposes of this section, if benefits for an employee are provided under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is not an account balance plan (a nonaccount balance plan), the amount deferred for a period equals the present value of the additional future payment or payments to which the employee has obtained a legally binding right (as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) under the plan during that period.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Present value defined.</E> For purposes of this section, <E T="03">present value</E> means the value as of a specified date of an amount or series of amounts due thereafter, where each amount is multiplied by the probability that the condition or conditions on which payment of the amount is contingent will be satisfied, and is discounted according to an assumed rate of interest to reflect the time value of money. For purposes of this section, the present value must be determined as of the date the amount deferred is required to be taken into account as wages under paragraph (e) of this section using actuarial assumptions and methods that are reasonable as of that date. For this purpose, a discount for the probability that an employee will die before commencement of benefit payments is permitted, but only to the extent that benefits will be forfeited upon death. In addition, the present value cannot be discounted for the probability that payments will not be made (or will be reduced) because of the unfunded status of the plan, the risk associated with any deemed or actual investment of amounts deferred under the plan, the risk that the employer, the trustee, or another party will be unwilling or unable to pay, the possibility of future plan amendments, the possibility of a future change in the law, or similar <PRTPAGE P="102"/>risks or contingencies. Nor is the present value affected by the possibility that some of the payments due under the plan will be eligible for one of the exclusions from wages in section 3121(a).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Treatment of actuarially equivalent benefits</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of a nonaccount balance plan that permits employees to receive their benefits in more than one form or commencing at more than one date, the amount deferred is determined by assuming that payments are made in the normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are satisfied. Accordingly, in the case of a nonaccount balance plan that permits employees to receive their benefits in more than one form or commencing at more than one date, unless the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are satisfied, the amount deferred is treated as not reasonably ascertainable under the rules of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section until a form of benefit and a time of commencement are selected.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Use of normal form commencing at normal commencement date.</E> The requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) are satisfied by a nonaccount balance plan if the plan has a single normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date for the amount deferred and each other optional form is actuarially equivalent to the normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date using actuarial assumptions that are reasonable. For this purpose, each form of benefit for payment of the amount deferred commencing at a date is a separate optional form. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B), each optional form is actuarially equivalent to the normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date only if the terms of the plan in effect when the amount is deferred provide for every optional form to be actuarially equivalent and further provide for actuarial assumptions to determine actuarial equivalency that will be reasonable at the time the optional form is selected, without regard to whether market interest rates are higher or lower at the time the optional form is selected than at the time the amount is deferred. Thus, a plan that provides for every optional form to be actuarially equivalent satisfies this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) if it provides for actuarial equivalence to be determined—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) When an optional form is selected or when benefit payments under the optional form commence, based on assumptions that are reasonable then;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Based on an index that reflects market rates of interest from time to time (for example, the plan specifies that all benefits will be actuarially equivalent using the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table specified in section 417(e)); or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Based on actuarial assumptions specified in the plan and provides for those assumptions to be revised to be reasonable assumptions if they cease to be reasonable assumptions.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Fixed mortality assumptions permitted.</E> A plan does not fail to satisfy paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section merely because the plan specifies a fixed mortality assumption that is reasonable at the time the amount is deferred, even if that assumption is not reasonable at the time the optional form is selected. (But see paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(E) of this section for additional rules that apply if the mortality assumption is not reasonable at the time the optional form is selected.)</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date defined.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), the normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date under the plan is the form, and date of commencement, under which the payments due to the employee under the plan are expressed, prior to adjustments for form or timing of commencement of payments.</P>
                <P>(E) <E T="03">Rule applicable if actuarial assumptions cease to be reasonable.</E> If the terms of the plan in effect when an amount is deferred provide for actuarial assumptions to determine actuarial equivalency that will be reasonable at the time the optional form is selected or payments commence as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, but, at that time, the actuarial assumptions used under the plan are not reasonable, the employee will be treated as obtaining a legally binding right <PRTPAGE P="103"/>at that time (or, if earlier, at the date on which the plan is amended to provide actuarial assumptions that are not reasonable) to any additional benefits that result from the use of an unreasonable actuarial assumption. This might occur, for example, if the plan specifies that the actuarial assumptions will be reasonable assumptions to be set at the time the optional form is selected and the assumptions used are in fact not reasonable at that time.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Separate determination for each period.</E> The amount deferred under this paragraph (c) is determined separately for each period for which there is an amount deferred under the plan. In addition, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section are applied separately with respect to the amount deferred for each such period. Thus, for example, the fraction described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section and the amount of the true-up at the resolution date described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section are determined separately with respect to each amount deferred. See paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D) of this section for special rules for allocating amounts deferred over more than one year.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Examples.</E> This paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples. (The examples illustrate the rules in this paragraph (c) and include various interest rate and mortality table assumptions, including the applicable section 417(e) mortality table, the GAM 83 (male) mortality table, and UP-84 mortality table.

All amounts credited under the plan are 100 percent vested, and the benefits payable to Employee B are based solely on the balance credited to Employee B's account. As permitted by paragraph (e)(5) of this section, any amount deferred under the plan for the calendar year is taken into account as wages on the last day of the year.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The plan is an account balance plan. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount deferred for a calendar year equals 10 percent of annual compensation (i.e., the sum of the principal amounts credited to Employee B's account for the year) plus the interest credited with respect to that 10 percent principal amount through the last day of the calendar year. If Employer N had not chosen to apply paragraph (e)(5) of this section and, thus, had taken into account 2.5 percent of compensation quarterly, the interest credited with respect to those quarterly amounts would not have been treated as part of the amount deferred for the year.</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer O establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for a group of five employees. Under the plan, a specified sum is credited to an account for the benefit of the group of employees on July 31 of each year. Income on the balance of the account is credited annually at a rate that is reasonable for each year. The benefit payable to an employee is equal to one-fifth of the account balance and is payable, at the employee's option, in a lump sum or in 10 annual installments that reflect income on the balance.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 5:</HD>
                  <P>(i) Employer P establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for a group of employees. Under the plan, each participating employee has a fully vested right to receive a life annuity, payable monthly beginning at age 65, equal to the product of 2 percent for each year of service and the employee's highest average annual compensation for any 3-year period. The plan also provides that, if an employee dies before age 65, the present value of the future payments will be paid to his or her beneficiary. As permitted under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, any amount deferred under the plan for a calendar year is taken into account as FICA wages as of the last day of the year. As of December 31, 2002, Employee C is age 60, has 25 years of service, and high 3-year average compensation of $100,000 (the average for the years 2000 through 2002). As of December 31, 2003, Employee C is age 61, has 26 years of service, and has high 3-year average compensation of $104,000. As of December 31, 2004, Employee C is age 62, has 27 years of service, and has high 3-year average compensation of $105,000. The assumptions that Employer P uses to determine the amount deferred for 2003 (a 7 percent interest rate and, for the period after commencement of benefit payments, the GAM 83 (male) mortality table) and for 2004 (a 7.5 percent interest rate and, for the period after commencement of benefit payments, the GAM 83 (male) mortality table) are assumed, solely for purposes of this example, to be reasonable actuarial assumptions.</P>
                  <P>(ii) As of December 31, 2002, Employee C has a legally binding right to receive lifetime payments of $50,000 (2 percent × 25 years × $100,000) per year. As of December 31, 2003, Employee C has a legally binding right to receive lifetime payments of $54,080 (2 percent × 26 years × $104,000) per year. Thus, during 2003, Employee C has earned a legally binding right to additional lifetime payments of $4,080 ($54,080−$50,000) per year beginning at age 65. The amount deferred for 2003 is the present value, as of December 31, 2003, of these additional payments, which is $28,767 ($4,080 × the present value factor for a deferred annuity payable at age 65, using the specified actuarial assumptions for 2003). Similarly, during 2004, Employee C has earned a legally binding right to additional lifetime payments of $2,620 (2 percent × 27 years × $105,000, minus $54,080) per year beginning at age 65. The amount deferred for 2004 is the present value, as of December 31, 2004, of these additional payments, which is $18,845 ($2,620 × the present value factor for a deferred annuity payable at age 65, using the specified actuarial assumptions for 2004).</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer Q establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Employee D on January 1, 2001, when Employee D is age 63. During 2001, Employee D obtains a fully vested right to receive a life annuity under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan equal to the excess of $200,000 over the life annuity benefits payable to Employee D under a qualified defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Employer Q. The life annuity benefit payable annually under the qualified plan is the lesser of $200,000 and the section 415(b)(1)(A) limitation in effect for the year, where the section 415(b)(1)(A) limitation is automatically adjusted to reflect changes in the cost of living. Benefits under both the qualified and nonqualified plan are payable monthly beginning at age 65. For purposes of this example, the section 415(b)(1)(A) limit for 2001 is assumed to be $140,000. The nonqualified plan provides no benefits in the event Employee D dies prior to commencement of benefit payments. As permitted under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, any amount deferred under the plan for a calendar year is taken into account as FICA wages as of the last day of the year. The assumptions that Employer Q uses to determine the amount deferred for 2001 (a 7 percent interest rate, a 3 percent increase in the cost of living and the GAM 83 (male) mortality table) are assumed, solely for purposes of this example, to be reasonable actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2001, Employee D has a legally binding right to receive lifetime payments as set forth in the following table:</P>

                  <P>(ii) The amount deferred for 2001 is the present value, as of December 31, 2001, of the net lifetime payments under the nonqualified plan, or $223,753.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Amounts taken into account and income attributable thereto</E>—(1) <E T="03">Amounts taken into account</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of this section, an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is taken into account as of the date it is included in <PRTPAGE P="105"/>computing the amount of <E T="03">wages</E> as defined in section 3121(a), but only to the extent that any additional FICA tax that results from such inclusion (including any interest and penalties for late payment) is actually paid before the expiration of the applicable period of limitations for the period in which the amount deferred was required to be taken into account under paragraph (e) of this section. Because an amount deferred for a calendar year is combined with the employee's other wages for the year for purposes of computing FICA taxes with respect to the employee for the year, if the employee has other wages that equal or exceed the wage base limitations for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) portion (or, in the case of years before 1994, the Hospital Insurance (HI) portion) of FICA for the year, no portion of the amount deferred will actually result in additional OASDI (or HI) tax. However, because there is no wage base limitation for the HI portion of FICA for years after 1993, the entire amount deferred (in addition to all other wages) is subject to the HI tax for the year and, thus, will not be considered taken into account for purposes of this section unless the HI tax relating to the amount deferred is actually paid. In determining whether any additional FICA tax relating to the amount deferred is actually paid, any FICA tax paid in a year is treated as paid with respect to an amount deferred only after FICA tax is paid on all other wages for the year.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amounts not taken into account</E>—(A) <E T="03">Failure to take an amount deferred into account under the special timing rule.</E> If an amount deferred for a period (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) is not taken into account, then the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section does not apply, and benefit payments attributable to that amount deferred are included as wages in accordance with the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For example, if an amount deferred is required to be taken into account in a particular year under paragraph (e) of this section, but the employer fails to pay the additional FICA tax resulting from that amount, then the amount deferred and the income attributable to that amount must be included as wages when actually or constructively paid.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Failure to take a portion of an amount deferred into account under the special timing rule.</E> If, as of the date an amount deferred is required to be taken into account, only a portion of the amount deferred (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) has been taken into account, then a portion of each subsequent benefit payment that is attributable to that amount is excluded from wages pursuant to the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section and the balance is subject to the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The portion that is excluded from wages is fixed immediately before the attributable benefit payments commence (or, if later, the date the amount deferred is required to be taken into account) and is determined by multiplying each such payment by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount that was taken into account (plus income attributable to that amount determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section through the date the portion is fixed) and the denominator of which is the present value of the future benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred, determined as of the date the portion is fixed. For this purpose, if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are satisfied, the present value is determined by assuming that payments are made in the normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date. In addition, if the employer demonstrates that the amount deferred was determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions as determined by the Commissioner, the present value of the future benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred is determined using those assumptions. In any other case, see paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Income attributable to the amount taken into account</E>—(i) <E T="03">Account balance plans</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, in the case of an account balance plan, the <E T="03">income attributable to the amount taken into account</E> means any amount credited on <PRTPAGE P="106"/>behalf of an employee under the terms of the plan that is income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section) attributable to an amount previously taken into account (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section), but only if the income reflects a rate of return that does not exceed either the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment (as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section) or, if the income does not reflect the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment (as so determined), a reasonable rate of interest (as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section).</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Rules relating to actual investment—(1) In general.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(i), the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment for any period means the rate of total return (including increases or decreases in fair market value) that would apply if the account balance were, during the applicable period, actually invested in one or more investments that are identified in accordance with the plan before the beginning of the period. For this purpose, an account balance plan can determine income based on the rate of return of a predetermined actual investment regardless of whether assets associated with the plan or the employer are actually invested therein and regardless of whether that investment is generally available to the public. For example, an account balance plan could provide that income on the account balance is determined based on an employee's prospective election among various investment alternatives that are available under the employer's section 401(k) plan, even if one of those investment alternatives is not generally available to the public. In addition, an actual investment includes an investment identified by reference to any stock index with respect to which there are positions traded on a national securities exchange described in section 1256(g)(7)(A).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Certain rates of return not based on predetermined actual investment.</E> A rate of return will not be treated as the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment within the meaning of this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) if the rate of return (to any extent or under any conditions) is based on the greater of the rate of return of two or more actual investments, is based on the greater of the rate of return on an actual investment and a rate of interest (whether or not the rate of interest would otherwise be reasonable under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section), or is based on the rate of return on an actual investment that is not predetermined. For example, if a plan bases the rate of return on the greater of the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment (such as the value of the employer's stock), and a 0 percent interest rate (i.e., without regard to decreases in the value of that investment), the plan is using a rate of return that is not a rate of return on a predetermined actual investment within the meaning of this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B).</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Rules relating to reasonable interest rates—(1) In general.</E> If income for a period is credited to an account balance plan on a basis other than the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment (as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section), then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C), the determination of whether the income for the period is based on a reasonable rate of interest will be made at the time the amount deferred is required to be taken into account and annually thereafter.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Fixed rates permitted.</E> If, with respect to an amount deferred for a period, an account balance plan provides for a fixed rate of interest to be credited, and the rate is to be reset under the plan at a specified future date that is not later than the end of the fifth calendar year that begins after the beginning of the period, the rate is reasonable at the beginning of the period, and the rate is not changed before the reset date, then the rate will be treated as reasonable in all future periods before the reset date.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Nonaccount balance plans.</E> For purposes of the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, in the case of a nonaccount balance plan, the <E T="03">income attributable to the amount taken into account</E> means the increase, due solely to the passage of time, in <PRTPAGE P="107"/>the present value of the future payments to which the employee has obtained a legally binding right, the present value of which constituted the amount taken into account (determined as of the date such amount was taken into account), but only if the amount taken into account was determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods. Thus, for each year, there will be an increase (determined using the same interest rate used to determine the amount taken into account) resulting from the shortening of the discount period before the future payments are made, plus, if applicable, an increase in the present value resulting from the employee's survivorship during the year. As a result, if the amount deferred for a period is determined using a reasonable interest rate and other reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, and the amount is taken into account when required under paragraph (e) of this section, then, under the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, none of the future payments attributable to that amount will be subject to FICA tax when paid.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Unreasonable rates of return</E>—(A) <E T="03">Account balance plans.</E> This paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) applies to an account balance plan under which the income credited is based on neither a predetermined actual investment, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, nor a rate of interest that is reasonable, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section, as determined by the Commissioner. In that event, the employer must calculate the amount that would be credited as income under a reasonable rate of interest, determine the excess (if any) of the amount credited under the plan over the income that would be credited using the reasonable rate of interest, and take that excess into account as an additional amount deferred in the year the income is credited. If the employer fails to calculate the amount that would be credited as income under a reasonable rate of interest and to take the excess into account as an additional amount deferred in the year the income is credited, or the employer otherwise fails to take the full amount deferred into account, then the excess of the income credited under the plan over the income that would be credited using AFR will be treated as an amount deferred in the year the income is credited. For purposes of this section, <E T="03">AFR</E> means the mid-term applicable federal rate (as defined pursuant to section 1274(d)) for January 1 of the calendar year, compounded annually. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the excess over the income that would result from the application of AFR and any income attributable to that excess are subject to the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Nonaccount balance plans.</E> If any actuarial assumption or method used to determine the amount taken into account under a nonaccount balance plan is not reasonable, as determined by the Commissioner, then the income attributable to the amount taken into account is limited to the income that would result from the application of the AFR and, if applicable, the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(I) (the 417(e) mortality table), both determined as of the January 1 of the calendar year in which the amount was taken into account. In addition, paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section applies and, in calculating the fraction described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (at the date specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section), the numerator is the amount taken into account plus income (as limited under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)), and the present value in the denominator is determined using the AFR, the 417(e) mortality table, and reasonable assumptions as to cost of living, each determined as of the time the amount deferred was required to be taken into account.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>

                  <P>(i) In 2001, Employer M establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Employee A under which all benefits are 100 percent vested. In 2002, Employee A has $200,000 of current annual compensation from Employer M that is subject to FICA tax. The amount deferred under the plan on behalf of Employee A for 2002 is $20,000. Thus, Employee A has total wages for FICA tax purposes of $220,000. Because Employee A has other wages that exceed the OASDI wage base for 2002, no additional OASDI tax is due <PRTPAGE P="108"/>as a result of the $20,000 amount deferred. Because there is no wage base limitation for the HI portion of FICA, additional HI tax liability results from the $20,000 amount deferred. However, Employer M fails to pay the additional HI tax.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, an amount deferred is considered taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes as of the date it is included in computing FICA wages, but only if any additional FICA tax liability that results from inclusion of the amount deferred is actually paid. Because the HI tax resulting from the $20,000 amount deferred was not paid, that amount deferred was not taken into account within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, benefit payments attributable to the $20,000 amount deferred will be included as wages in accordance with the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and will be subject to the HI portion of FICA tax when actually or constructively paid (and the OASDI portion of FICA tax to the extent Employee A's wages do not exceed the OASDI wage base limitation).</P>

                  <P>(ii) Because the HI tax resulting from the $20,000 amount deferred is paid, that amount deferred is considered taken into account for 2002. Thus, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, neither the amount deferred nor the income attributable to the amount taken into account will be treated as wages for FICA tax purposes at any time thereafter.</P>

The employee's account balance also is increased each December 31 by <E T="03">interest</E> on the total amounts credited to the employee's account as of the preceding December 31. The interest rate specified in the plan results in income credits that are not based on the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, and that are greater than the income that would result from application of a reasonable rate of interest within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

Employer N fails to take into account an additional amount for the excess of the income credited under the plan over a reasonable rate of interest.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Because the rate of increase or decrease is based on the greater of two rates of returns, the increase is not based on the return on a predetermined actual investment within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section. Thus, if the rate of return credited under the plan (i.e., the greater of the rates of return of the two mutual funds) exceeds the income that would be credited using the AFR, the excess is not considered income attributable to the amount taken into account within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, is considered an additional amount deferred.</P>

The board is authorized to switch investments more frequently on a prospective basis. Before the beginning of 2004, the board designates Company A stock as the investment for 2004. Before the beginning of 2005, the board designates Company B stock as the investment for 2005. At the end of 2005, the board determines that the return on Company B stock was lower than expected and changes its designation for 2005 to the rate of return on Company C stock, which had a higher return during 2005.

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 9:</HD>
                  <P>(i) Employer O establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Employee B. Under the plan, if Employee B survives until age 65, he has a fully vested right to receive a lump sum payment at that age, equal to the product of 10 percent per year of service and Employee B's highest average annual compensation for any 3-year period, but no benefits are payable in the event Employee B dies prior to age 65. As permitted under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, any amount deferred under the plan for the calendar year is taken into account as wages as of the last day of the year. As of December 31, 2002, Employee B has 25 years of service and Employee B's high 3-year average compensation is $100,000 (the average for the years 2000 through 2002). As of December 31, 2002, Employee B has a legally binding right to receive a payment at age 65 of $250,000 (10 percent × 25 years × $100,000). As of December 31, 2003, Employee B is age 63, has 26 years of service, and has high 3-year average compensation of $104,000. As of December 31, 2003, Employee B has a legally binding right to receive a payment at age 65 of $270,400 (10 percent × 26 years × $104,000). Thus, during 2003, Employee B has earned a legally binding right to an additional payment at age 65 of $20,400 ($270,400−$250,000). The assumptions that Employer O uses to determine the amount deferred for 2003 are a 7 percent interest rate and the GAM 83 (male) mortality table, which, solely for purposes of this example, are assumed to be reasonable actuarial assumptions. The amount deferred for 2003 is the present value, as of December 31, 2003, of the $20,400 payment, which is $17,353. Employer O takes this amount into account by including it in Employee B's FICA wages for 2003 and paying the additional FICA tax.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the income attributable to the amount that was taken into account is the increase in the present value of the future payment due solely to the passage of time, because the amount deferred was determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods. As of the payment date at age 65, the present value of the future payment earned during 2003 is $20,400. The entire difference between the $20,400 and the $17,353 amount deferred ($3,047) is the increase in the present value of the future payment due solely to the passage of time, and thus constitutes income attributable to the amount taken into account. Because the amount deferred was taken into account, the entire payment of $20,400 represents either an amount deferred that was previously taken into account ($17,353) or income attributable to that amount ($3,047). Accordingly, pursuant to the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, none of the payment is included in wages.</P>

                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 9,</E> except that, instead of providing a lump sum equal to 10 percent of average compensation per year of service, the plan provides Employee B with a fully vested right to receive a life annuity, payable monthly beginning at age 65, equal to the product of 2 percent for each year of service and Employee B's highest average annual compensation for any 3-year period. The plan also provides that, if Employee B dies before age 65, the present value of the future payments will be paid to his or her beneficiary. As of December 31, 2002, Employee B has a legally binding right to receive lifetime payments of $50,000 (2 percent × 25 years × $100,000) per year. As of December 31, 2003, Employee B has a legally binding right to receive lifetime payments of $54,080 (2 percent × 26 years × $104,000) per year. Thus, during 2003, Employee B has earned a legally binding right to additional lifetime payments of $4,080 ($54,080−$50,000) per year beginning at age 65. The amount deferred for 2003 is $32,935, which is the present value, as of December 31, 2003, of these additional payments, determined using the same actuarial assumptions and methods used in <E T="03">Example 9,</E> except that there is no discount for the probability of death prior to age 65. Employer O takes this amount into account by including it in Employee B's FICA wages for 2003 and paying the additional FICA tax.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the income attributable to the amount <PRTPAGE P="110"/>that was taken into account is the increase in the present value of the future payments due solely to the passage of time, because the amount deferred was determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods. Because the amount deferred was taken into account, each annual payment of $4,080 attributable to the amount deferred in 2003 represents either an amount deferred that was previously taken into account or income attributable to that amount. Accordingly, pursuant to the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, none of the payments are included in wages.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, if an amount deferred for a period is not taken into account, then the benefit payments attributable to that amount deferred are included as wages in accordance with the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In this case, assuming that the amounts deferred in other periods were taken into account, $4,080 of each year's total benefit payments will be included in wages when actually or constructively paid, in accordance with the general timing rule.</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer P establishes an account balance plan on January 1, 2002, under which all benefits are 100 percent vested.

Employer P treats the excess over the applicable interest rate in section 417(e) as an additional amount deferred for 2002 and in each year thereafter, and takes the additional amount into account by including it in FICA wages and paying the additional FICA tax for the year.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under the nonduplication rule in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the benefits paid under the plan will be excluded from wages for FICA tax purposes.</P>

                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 9,</E> except that, in determining the amount deferred, Employer O uses a 15 percent interest rate, which, solely for purposes of this example, is assumed not to be a reasonable interest rate. Employer O determines that the amount deferred for 2003 is the present value, as of December 31, 2003, of the $20,400 payment, which is $15,023. Employer O includes $15,023 in wages and pays any resulting FICA tax. Solely for purposes of this example, it is assumed that the AFR as of January 1, 2003, is 7 percent.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, if any actuarial assumption or method is not reasonable, then the income attributable to the amount taken into account is limited to the income that would result from application of the AFR and, if applicable, the 417(e) mortality table. Because the 15 percent interest rate is unreasonable, the income attributable to the amount taken into account is limited to the income that would result from using a 7 percent interest rate and, in this case, an increase for survivorship using the 417(e) mortality table. Under these assumptions, the income attributable to the $15,023 amount taken into account for 2003 is $1,199 in 2004 and $1,313 in 2005. Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the sum of these amounts ($17,535) is excluded from Employee B's wages pursuant to the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, and the balance of the payment ($2,865) is subject to the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and, thus, is included in Employee B's wages when actually or constructively paid.</P>

                  <P>(iii) The same result can be reached by multiplying the attributable benefit payments by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount taken into account, and the denominator of which is the amount deferred that would have been taken into account at the same time had the amount deferred been calculated using the AFR and the 417(e) mortality table. These assumptions are determined as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the amount was taken into account. In this <E T="03">Example 13,</E> the fraction would be $15,023 divided by $17,478, which equals .85954. The $20,400 payment is multiplied by this fraction to determine the amount of the payment that is excluded from wages pursuant to the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Thus, $17,535 ($20,400 × .85954) is excluded from wages and the balance ($2,865) is subject to FICA tax when actually or constructively paid.</P>

                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as <E T="03">Example 10,</E> except that Employer O calculates the amount deferred for 2003 as $18,252 and takes that amount into account by including that amount in wages and paying any resulting FICA tax. The assumptions that Employer O uses to determine the amount deferred are a 15 percent interest rate and, for the period after commencement of benefit payments, the GAM 83 (male) mortality table. The 15 percent interest rate is assumed, solely for purposes of this example, not to be a reasonable actuarial assumption. Solely for purposes of this example, it is assumed that the AFR as of January 1, 2003, is 7 percent.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, if any actuarial assumption or method used is not reasonable, then the income attributable to the amount taken into account is limited to the income that would result from application of the AFR and, if applicable, the 417(e) mortality table. Because the 15 percent interest rate is not reasonable, the income attributable to the amount taken into account is equal to the <PRTPAGE P="111"/>income that would result from using a 7 percent interest rate and the amount taken into account is treated as if it represented a portion of the amount deferred for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Under these assumptions, the income attributable to the $18,252 amount taken into account for 2003 is $1,278 in 2004 and $1,367 in 2005. Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the portion of each benefit payment attributable to the amount deferred that is excluded from wages pursuant to the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section is determined at benefit commencement by multiplying each benefit payment by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount taken into account (plus income attributable to that amount) and the denominator of which is the present value of future benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred. Because the interest rate assumption is not reasonable, not only is the income limited to the application of the AFR, but the present value in the denominator must be determined using the AFR and (if applicable) the 417(e) mortality table. In this case, the present value is $40,283 and thus the fraction is $20,897 divided by $40,283, or .51875. Thus, $2,116 (.51875 × $4,080) of each year's benefit payment is excluded from wages and the balance of each year's payment ($1,964) is subject to the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and is included in wages when actually or constructively paid.</P>

                  <P>(iii) The same result can be reached by multiplying the attributable benefit payments by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount taken into account, and the denominator of which is the amount deferred that would have been taken into account at the same time had the amount deferred been calculated using the AFR and the 417(e) mortality table. These assumptions are determined as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the amount was taken into account. In this <E T="03">Example 14,</E> the fraction would be $18,252 divided by $35,185, which equals .51875. The $4,080 annual payment is multiplied by this fraction to determine the amount of the payment that is excluded from wages pursuant to the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Thus, $2,116 ($4,080 × .51875) is excluded from wages and the balance ($1,964) is subject to FICA tax when actually or constructively paid.</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Time amounts deferred are required to be taken into account</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan must be taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes as of the later of the date on which services creating the right to the amount deferred are performed (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) or the date on which the right to the amount deferred is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section). However, in no event may any amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan be taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes prior to the establishment of the plan providing for the amount deferred (or, if later, the plan amendment providing for the amount deferred). Therefore, if an amount is deferred pursuant to the terms of a legally binding agreement that is not put in writing until after the amount would otherwise be taken into account under this paragraph (e)(1), the amount deferred (including any attributable income) must be taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes as of the date the material terms of the plan are put in writing.</P>

In this case, the amount required to be taken <PRTPAGE P="112"/>into account as of the resolution date is determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Definition of reasonably ascertainable.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), an amount deferred is considered reasonably ascertainable on the first date on which the amount, form, and commencement date of the benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred are known, and the only actuarial or other assumptions regarding future events or circumstances needed to determine the amount deferred are interest and mortality. For this purpose, the form and commencement date of the benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred are treated as known if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section (under which payments are treated as being made in the normal form of benefit commencing at normal commencement date) are satisfied. In addition, an amount deferred does not fail to be reasonably ascertainable on a date merely because the exact amount of the benefit payable cannot readily be calculated on that date or merely because the exact amount of the benefit payable depends on future changes in the cost of living. If the exact amount of the benefit payable depends on future changes in the cost of living, the amount deferred must be determined using a reasonable assumption as to the future changes in the cost of living. For example, the amount of a benefit is treated as known even if the exact amount of the benefit payable cannot be determined until future changes in the cost of living are reflected in the section 415 limitation on benefits payable under a qualified retirement plan.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Earlier inclusion permitted</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> With respect to an amount deferred that is not reasonably ascertainable, an employer may choose to take an amount into account at any date or dates (an early inclusion date or dates) before the resolution date (but not before the date described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section with respect to the amount deferred). Thus, for example, with respect to an amount deferred under a nonaccount balance plan that is not reasonably ascertainable because the plan permits employees to receive their benefits in more than one form or commencing at more than one date (and the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section are not satisfied), an employer may choose to take an amount into account on the date otherwise described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section before the form and commencement date are selected (based on assumptions as to the form and commencement date for the benefit payments) or may choose to wait until the form and commencement date of the benefit payments are selected. An employer that chooses to take an amount into account at an early inclusion date under this paragraph (e)(4)(ii) for an employee under a plan is not required until the resolution date to identify the period to which the amount taken into account relates.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">True-up at resolution date.</E> If, with respect to an amount deferred for a period, an employer chooses to take an amount into account as of an early inclusion date in accordance with this paragraph (e)(4)(ii) and the benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred exceed the benefit payments that are actuarially equivalent to the amount taken into account at the early inclusion date (payable in the same form and using the same commencement date as the benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred), then the present value of the difference in the benefits, determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, must be taken into account as of the resolution date.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Actuarial assumptions.</E> For purposes of determining the benefits that are actuarially equivalent to the amount taken into account as of an early inclusion date, the amount taken into account is converted to an actuarially equivalent benefit payable in the same form and commencing on the same date as the actual benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred using an interest rate, and, if applicable, mortality and cost-of-living assumptions, that were reasonable as of the early inclusion date. Thus, with respect to an amount deferred for a period, the amount required to be taken into account as of the resolution date is the present value (determined using <PRTPAGE P="113"/>an interest rate, and, if applicable, mortality and cost-of-living assumptions, that are reasonable as of the resolution date) of the excess, if any, of the future benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred over the future benefits payable in the same form and commencing on the same date that are actuarially equivalent to the portion of the amount deferred that was taken into account as of the early inclusion date (where actuarial equivalence is determined using an interest rate, and, if applicable, mortality and cost-of-living assumptions, that were reasonable as of the early inclusion date).</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Allocation rules for amounts deferred over more than one period</E>—(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The rules of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D) apply for purposes of determining whether an amount has been included under this paragraph (e)(4) before the earliest date permitted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Future compensation increases.</E> Increases in an employee's compensation after the early inclusion date must be disregarded.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Early retirement subsidies.</E> An early retirement subsidy that the employee ultimately receives may be taken into account at an early inclusion date if the employee would have a legally binding right to the subsidy at the early inclusion date but for any condition that the employee continue to render services. Accordingly, an employer may take into account at an early inclusion date any early retirement subsidy that the employee ultimately receives to the extent that elimination or reduction of that subsidy would violate section 411(d)(6)(B)(i) if that section applied to the plan.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) <E T="03">Allocation with respect to offsets.</E> In any case in which a series of amounts are deferred over more than one period, the amounts deferred are not reasonably ascertainable until a single resolution date and the benefit payments attributable to the entire series are determined under a formula that provides a gross benefit that in the aggregate is subject to an objective reduction for future events under the terms of the plan, such as an offset for the aggregate benefits payable under a plan qualified under section 401(a), the attribution of benefit payments to the amount deferred in each period is determined under the rules of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">4</E>). In a case described in the preceding sentence, the benefit payments made as a result of the series of amounts deferred may be treated as attributable to the amount deferred as of the earliest period in which the employee obtained a legally binding right to a benefit under the plan equal to the excess, if any, of the amount of the gross benefit attributable to that period (determined at the resolution date), over the amount of the reduction determined as of the end of that period. Thus, for example, if an employee obtains a legally binding right in each of several years to benefit payments from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides for a specified gross benefit for the years to be offset by the benefits payable under a qualified plan, the amount deferred in the first year may be treated as equal to the gross benefit for the year, reduced by the offset applicable at the end of the year (even if the offset increases after the end of the year).</P>
                <P>(E) <E T="03">Treatment of benefits paid before the resolution date.</E> If a benefit payment is attributable to an amount deferred that is not reasonably ascertainable at the time of payment (or is paid before the date selected under paragraph (e)(5) of this section), and the employer has previously taken an amount into account with respect to the amount deferred under the early inclusion rule of this paragraph (e)(4), then, in lieu of the pro rata rule provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, a first-in-first-out rule applies in determining the portion of the benefit payment attributable to the amount taken into account. Under this first-in-first-out rule, the benefit payment is compared to the sum of the amount taken into account at the early inclusion date and the income attributable to that amount. If the benefit payment equals or exceeds the amount taken into account at the early inclusion date and the income attributable to that amount as of the date of the benefit <PRTPAGE P="114"/>payment, the benefit payment is included as wages under the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the extent of any excess, and the amount taken into account at the early inclusion date (and income attributable to that amount) is disregarded thereafter with respect to the amount deferred. If the amount taken into account at the early inclusion date and the income attributable to that amount as of the date of the benefit payment exceeds the benefit payment, the benefit payment is not included as wages under the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and, in determining the amount that must be taken into account thereafter with respect to the amount deferred, the amount taken into account at the early inclusion date, plus attributable income as of the date of the benefit payment, is reduced by the amount of the benefit payment, and only the excess plus future income attributable to the excess (credited using assumptions that were reasonable on the early inclusion date) is taken into consideration. If amounts have been taken into account at more than one early inclusion date, this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(E) applies on a first-in-first-out basis, beginning with the amount taken into account at the earliest early inclusion date (including income attributable thereto).</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Rule of administrative convenience.</E> For purposes of this section, an employer may treat an amount deferred as required to be taken into account under this paragraph (e) on any date that is later than, but within the same calendar year as, the actual date on which the amount deferred is otherwise required to be taken into account under this paragraph (e). For example, if services creating the right to an amount deferred are considered performed under paragraph (e)(2) of this section periodically throughout a year, the employer may nevertheless treat the services creating the right to that amount deferred as performed on December 31 of that year. If an employer uses the rule of administrative convenience described in this paragraph (e)(5), any determination of whether the income attributable to an amount deferred under an account balance plan is based on a reasonable rate of interest or whether the actuarial assumptions used to determine the present value of an amount deferred in a nonaccount balance plan are reasonable will be made as of the date the employer selects to take the amount into account.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Portions of an amount deferred required to be taken into account on more than one date.</E> If different portions of an amount deferred are required to be taken into account under paragraph (e)(1) of this section on more than one date (e.g., on account of a graded vesting schedule), then each such portion is considered a separate amount deferred for purposes of this section.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Examples.</E> This paragraph (e) is illustrated by the following examples:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                  <P>(i) Employer M establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Employee A on November 1, 2005. Under the plan, which is an account balance plan, Employee A obtains a legally binding right on the last day of each calendar year (if Employee A is employed on that date) to be credited with a principal amount equal to 5 percent of compensation for the year. In addition, a reasonable rate of interest is credited quarterly. Employee A's account balance is nonforfeitable and is payable upon Employee A's termination of employment. For 2006, the principal amount credited to Employee A under the plan (which, in this case, is also the amount deferred within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) is $25,000.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the services creating the right to the $25,000 amount deferred are considered performed as of December 31, 2006, the date on which Employee A has performed all of the services necessary to obtain a legally binding right to the amount deferred. Thus, in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the $25,000 amount deferred must be taken into account as of December 31, 2006, which is the later of the date on which services creating the right to the amount deferred are performed or the date on which the right to the amount deferred is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 1,</E> except that the principal amount credited under the plan on the last day of each year (and attributable interest) is forfeited if the employee terminates employment within five years of that date.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the determination of whether the right to an amount deferred is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture is made in accordance with the principles of section 83. Under § 1.83-3(c) <PRTPAGE P="115"/>of this chapter, a substantial risk of forfeiture generally exists where rights in property that are transferred are conditioned, directly or indirectly, upon the future performance of substantial services. Because Employee A's right to receive the $25,000 principal amount (and attributable interest) is conditioned on the performance of services for five years, a substantial risk of forfeiture exists with respect to that amount deferred until December 31, 2011.</P>
                  <P>(iii) December 31, 2011, is the later of the date on which services creating the right to the amount deferred are performed or the date on which the right to the amount deferred is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Thus, in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the amount deferred (which, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, is equal to the $25,000 principal amount credited to Employee A's account on December 31, 2006, plus the interest credited with respect to that principal amount through December 31, 2011) must be taken into account as of December 31, 2011.</P>

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3:</HD>
                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 2,</E> except that the principal amount credited under the plan on the last day of each year (and attributable interest) becomes nonforfeitable according to a graded vesting schedule under which 20 percent is vested as of December 31, 2007; 40 percent is vested as of December 31, 2008; 60 percent is vested as of December 31, 2009; 80 percent is vested as of December 31, 2010; and 100 percent is vested as of December 31, 2011. Because these dates are later than the date on which the services creating the right to the amount deferred are considered performed (December 31, 2006), the amount deferred is required to be taken into account as of these dates that fall in five different years.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Paragraph (e)(6) of this section provides that, if different portions of an amount deferred are required to be taken into account under paragraph (e)(1) of this section on more than one date, then each such portion is considered a separate amount deferred for purposes of this section. Thus, $5,000 of the principal amount, plus interest credited through December 31, 2007, is taken into account as an amount deferred on December 31, 2007; $5,000 of the principal amount, plus interest credited through December 31, 2008, is taken into account as a separate amount deferred on December 31, 2008; etc.</P>

                  <P>(i) On November 21, 2001, Employer N establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under which all benefits are 100 percent vested. The plan provides for Employee B (who is age 45) to receive a lump sum benefit of $500,000 at age 65. This benefit will be forfeited if Employee B dies before age 65.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Because the amount, form, and commencement date of the benefit are known, and the only assumptions needed to determine the amount deferred are interest and mortality, the amount deferred is reasonably ascertainable within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section on November 21, 2001.</P>

                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 4,</E> except that plan provides that the lump sum will be paid at the later of age 65 or termination of employment and provides that the $500,000 payable to Employee B is increased by 5 percent per year for each year that payment is deferred beyond age 65.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Because the commencement date of the benefit payment is contingent on when Employee B terminates employment, the commencement date of the benefit payment is not known. Thus, the amount deferred is not reasonably ascertainable within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, unless the plan satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Because the fixed 5 percent factor may not be reasonable at the time benefit payments commence (i.e., 5 percent might be higher or lower than a reasonable interest rate when payments commence), the plan fails to satisfy paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and accordingly the amount deferred is not reasonably ascertainable until termination of employment.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Because the commencement date of the benefit payment is contingent on when Employee B terminates employment, the commencement date of the benefit payment is not known. Thus, the amount deferred is not reasonably ascertainable until termination of employment.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Because the plan permits employees to elect to receive benefits in more than one form and the alternative forms may not have the same value when Employee B makes his election, the plan fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section until a form of benefit is selected. Thus, the amount deferred is not reasonably ascertainable until then.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 8:</HD>

                  <P>(i) Employer O establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The plan is a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) that provides Employee C with a fully vested right to receive a pension, in the form of a life annuity payable monthly, beginning at age 65, equal to the excess of 3 percent of Employee C's final 3-year average pay for each year of participation up to 15 years, over the amount payable to Employee C from Employer O's qualified <PRTPAGE P="116"/>pension plan. The amount payable under the qualified pension plan is a life annuity payable monthly, beginning at age 65, equal to 1.5 percent of final 3-year average pay for each year of employment, excluding pay in excess of the section 401(a)(17) compensation limit. No benefits are payable under the SERP if Employee C dies before age 65. Employee C becomes a participant in the SERP on January 1, 2001, at age 44. The amount deferred under the SERP for any year is not reasonably ascertainable prior to termination of employment because the amount of the benefit is not known and the determination of the amount deferred requires assumptions other than interest and mortality (e.g., an assumption as to Employee C's average pay for the final three years of employment). As permitted by paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, Employer O chooses not to take any amount into account for any year before the resolution date. Employee C terminates employment on December 31, 2018 when he is age 62.</P>
                  <P>(ii) As of the date Employee C terminates employment, the amount of the benefit is known and the only actuarial or other assumptions needed to determine the amount deferred are an interest rate assumption and a mortality assumption. At that time, the amount deferred in each past year becomes reasonably ascertainable, and Employer O is able to determine that during 2001 Employee C earned a legally binding right to a life annuity of $4,000 per year beginning in 2021 when Employee C is age 65. Employer O determines the present value of Employee C's future benefit payments under the SERP as of this resolution date (December 31, 2018), using a 7 percent interest rate and the UP-84 mortality table, which, solely for purposes of this example, are assumed to be reasonable actuarial assumptions for December 31, 2018. The special timing rule will be satisfied if the resulting present value, $26,950, is taken into account on that date in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 8,</E> except that the plan provides that Employee C may choose to receive early retirement benefits on an unreduced basis at any time after age 60 if Employee C has completed 15 years of service by that date.</P>
                  <P>(ii) As of the date Employee C terminates employment, the amount of the benefit is known and the only actuarial or other assumptions needed to determine the amount deferred are an interest rate assumption and a mortality assumption. At that time, the amount deferred in each past year becomes reasonably ascertainable, and Employer O is able to determine that during 2001 Employee C earned a legally binding right to a life annuity of $4,000 per year beginning on December 31, 2018 when Employee C is age 62. Employer O determines the present value of Employee C's future benefit payments under the SERP as of this resolution date (December 31, 2018), using a 7 percent interest rate and the UP-84 mortality table, which, solely for purposes of this example, are assumed to be reasonable actuarial assumptions for December 31, 2018.

The amount that Employer O takes into account on December 31, 2001, is $13,043 (the present value of a life annuity of $4,000 per year, payable at age 62, using a 6 percent interest rate and the UP-84 mortality table). Employer O does not take any other amount into account before the resolution date.</P>

                  <P>(ii) In accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, Employer O must determine any additional amount required to be taken into account in 2018. If the $4,000 payable in the form of a life annuity beginning at age 62 exceeds the life annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the $13,043 previously taken into account, the present value of the excess must be taken into account. In this <E T="03">Example 10,</E> the $13,043 previously taken into account is actuarially equivalent to a $4,000 annuity commencing at age 62 using a 6 percent interest rate and the UP-84 mortality table (which, solely for purposes of this example, are assumed to be reasonable actuarial assumptions for December 31, 2001). Accordingly, no additional amount need be taken into account in 2018, regardless of any changes in market rates of interest between 2001 and 2018.</P>

The amount that Employer O takes into account on December 31, 2001, is $9,569 (the present value of a life annuity of $4,000 per year, payable at age 65, using a 6 percent interest rate and the UP-84 mortality table). Employer O does not take any other amount into account before the resolution date.</P>

                  <P>(ii) In accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, Employer O must determine any additional amount required to be taken into account in 2018. If the $4,000 payable in the form of a life annuity beginning in 2018 at age 62 exceeds the life annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the $9,569 previously taken into account, the present value of the excess must be taken into account. In this case, the $9,569 previously taken into account is actuarially equivalent <PRTPAGE P="117"/>to a $2,935 annuity commencing at age 62 using a 6 percent interest rate and the UP-84 mortality table (which, solely for purposes of this example, are assumed to be reasonable actuarial assumptions for December 31, 2001). Accordingly, an additional amount needs to be taken into account in 2018 equal to the present value of the excess of the $4,000 annual stream of benefit payments to which Employee C obtained a legally binding right during 2001 over the $2,935 annual stream of benefit payments which is actuarially equivalent to the amount previously taken into account. This present value (i.e., the present value of a life annuity equal to $4,000 minus $2,935, or $1,065 annually) is determined by Employer O to be $10,005 as of the resolution date using a 7 percent interest rate and the UP-84 mortality table (which, solely for purposes of this example, are assumed to be reasonable actuarial assumptions for December 31, 2018).</P>

Employer O does not take any other amount into account before the resolution date.</P>
                  <P>(ii) In accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, Employer O must determine any additional amount required to be taken into account in 2018.

Because the life annuity of $4,856 per year (which is equivalent to the amount taken into account at the early inclusion date) exceeds the $4,000 annuity attributable to the amount deferred in 2001, no additional amount is required to be taken into account for that amount deferred as of the resolution date.

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 14:</HD>
                  <P>(i) In 2003, Employer P establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Employee D. The plan provides that, in consideration of Employee D's services to be performed on Project X in 2004, Employee D will have a nonforfeitable right to receive 1 percent per year of Employer P's net profits associated with Project X for each of the immediately succeeding three years. No services beyond 2004 are required. The 1 percent of net profits payable each year will be paid on March 31 of the immediately succeeding year. One percent of net profits associated with Project X is $750,000 in 2005, $400,000 in 2006, and $90,000 in 2007. Employee D receives $750,000 on March 31, 2006, $400,000 on March 31, 2007, and $90,000 on March 31, 2008.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Because the services creating the right to all of the amount deferred are performed in 2004, the benefit payments based on the 2005, 2006, and 2007 net profits are all attributable to the amount deferred in 2004. However, because the present value of Employee D's future benefit is contingent on future profits, the determination of the amount deferred requires the use of assumptions other than interest, mortality, and cost of living. Thus, all of the amount deferred in 2004 will not be reasonably ascertainable within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section until December 31, 2007 (which is the resolution date). Employer P does not choose to take any amount into account prior to the amount deferred becoming reasonably ascertainable.</P>
                  <P>(iii) However, paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section provides that a benefit payment attributable to an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan must be included as wages when actually or constructively paid if the amount deferred has not been taken into account as wages under the special timing rule of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Thus, the benefit payments in 2006 and 2007 must be included as wages when paid.</P>

                  <P>(iv) As of December 31, 2007, all of the amount deferred under the plan becomes reasonably ascertainable because the amount of the benefit payable attributable to the amount deferred is treated as known under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, and the only assumption needed to determine the present value of the future benefits is interest. However, since Employer P was required to treat the payments in 2006 and 2007 as wages when paid under the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, only the present value of the payment to be made <PRTPAGE P="118"/>in 2008 is required to be taken into account as of the resolution date (December 31, 2007) under the special timing rule of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Using an interest rate of 10 percent per year (which, solely for purposes of this <E T="03">Example 14,</E> is assumed to be reasonable), Employer P determines that on December 31, 2007, the present value of the future benefits is $87,881, and Employer P includes that additional amount in wages for 2007. (Note that Employer P can choose to use the lag method of withholding described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, which allows the resolution date amount to be taken into account no later than March 31, 2008, provided that the amount deferred is increased by interest using the AFR for January of 2008.)</P>

                  <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 14,</E> except that Employer P chooses the early inclusion option permitted by paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section to take $1,000,000 into account on December 31, 2004, before the amount deferred for 2004 is reasonably ascertainable.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(E) of this section, in applying the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, a first-in-first-out rule applies in determining the benefit payments that are attributable to amounts previously taken into account. Using the 10 percent interest rate, Employer P determines that the $750,000 benefit payment on March 31, 2006, and the March 31, 2007, benefit payment of $400,000 are less than the $1,000,000 taken into account at the early inclusion date, plus attributable income, and, therefore, are not included in wages when paid.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(E) of this section, if an employer chooses to take an amount into account before the resolution date, the amount taken into account (plus income attributable to that amount) is disregarded to the extent the amount is attributed to benefit payments made before the resolution date. Thus, Employer P must reduce the $1,000,000 taken into account in 2004 (plus income attributable to that amount) based upon the two benefit payments ($750,000 and $400,000) that were excluded from wages. Using an interest rate of 10 percent, Employer P determines that the amount taken into account in 2004 plus interest to the resolution date and reduced based upon the two benefit payments is $15,228 and the additional amount that is required to be taken into account as of December 31, 2007, is $72,653 ($87,881-$15,228).</P>

                  <P>(i) Employee E obtains a fully vested, legally binding right during 2002, 2003, and 2004 to payments from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan of Employer Q under which the benefits are based on a formula that includes an actuarial offset by the account balance under a qualified defined contribution plan of Employer Q as of December 31, 2004. The payments from the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are to commence on December 31, 2005. At the resolution date for the amounts earned during 2002, 2003, and 2004, which is December 31, 2004, Employee E has a legally binding right to a net annual benefit of $100,000 payable for life to commence on December 31, 2005. On the resolution date, Employer Q determines that on December 31, 2002, Employee E had a legally binding right to receive $100,000 annually for life beginning on December 31, 2005 (as a result of the gross benefit under the nonqualified plan being $120,000 annually for life, and the offset being $20,000 annually for life, as of December 31, 2002). On December 31, 2003, Employee E had a legally binding right to receive $95,000 annually for life beginning on December 31, 2005 (as a result of the gross benefit under the nonqualified plan being $135,000 annually for life, and the offset being $40,000 annually for life, as of December 31, 2003). On December 31, 2004, Employee E had a legally binding right to receive $100,000 annually for life beginning on December 31, 2005 (as a result of the gross benefit under the nonqualified plan being $145,000 annually for life, and the offset being $45,000 annually for life, as of December 31, 2004).</P>

                  <P>(ii) In this case, pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section, Employer Q can attribute the entire $100,000 life annuity to the amount deferred for 2002, even though Employee E's benefit under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan is reduced to $95,000 in 2003.</P>

In 2011, Employee F performs services for which she earns a right to 10 percent of the proceeds from the sale of another motion picture. These proceeds are calculated by subtracting the total advertising expenses for both movies. Payment is to be made in the year following the date on which both pictures have been sold, but not later than 2018. At the end of 2010, the advertising expenses for both pictures totaled $300,000. The first motion picture is sold for $10,000,000 in 2014. The second motion picture is sold for $17,000,000 in 2017. At the end of 2017, the advertising expenses totaled $1,700,000. In 2018, Employee F is paid $2,530,000 (10 percent of the sum of $10,000,000 and $17,000,000 minus $1,700,000).</P>

                <P>(f) <E T="03">Withholding</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Unless an employer applies an alternative method described in paragraph (f)(2) or (3) of this section, an amount deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for any employee is treated, for purposes of withholding and depositing FICA tax, as wages paid by the employer and received by the employee at the time it is taken into account in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. However, paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section provide alternative methods which may be used with respect to an amount deferred for an employee. An employer is not required to be consistent in applying the alternatives described in this paragraph (f) with respect to different employees or amounts deferred.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Estimated method</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Under the alternative method provided in this paragraph (f)(2), the employer may make a reasonable estimate of the amount deferred on the date on which the amount is taken into account in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and take that estimated amount into account as wages paid by the employer and received by the employee on that date (the estimate date), for purposes of withholding and depositing FICA tax.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Underestimate of the amount deferred</E>—(A) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If the employer underestimates the amount deferred (as determined after calculating the actual amount deferred that should have been taken into account as of the date on which the amount was taken into account in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, using an interest rate and other actuarial assumptions that are reasonable as of that date), the employer may treat the shortfall as wages paid as of the estimate date or as of any date that is no later than three months after the estimate date. In either case, the shortfall does not include the income credited to the amount deferred after the amount is taken into account in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Shortfall is treated as wages paid on a date after the estimate date.</E> If the employer chooses to treat the shortfall as wages paid on a date that is no later than three months after the estimate date, the employer must take that shortfall into account as wages paid by the employer and received by the employee on that date, for purposes of withholding and depositing FICA tax.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Shortfall is treated as wages paid on the estimate date.</E> If the employer chooses to treat the shortfall as wages paid as of the estimate date, the shortfall is treated as an error for purposes of withholding and depositing FICA tax. Appropriate adjustments may be made in accordance with section 6205(a) and the regulations thereunder; however, for purposes of § 31.6205-1(b), the error need not be treated as ascertained before the date that is three months after the estimate date.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> The employer must report the shortfall as wages on Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return (and, if applicable, Form 941c, Supporting Statement to Correct Information) and Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (or, if applicable, Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement) in accordance with its treatment of the shortfall under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Overestimate of the amount deferred.</E> If the employer overestimates the amount deferred (as determined after calculating the actual amount deferred that should have been taken into account as of the date on which the amount was taken into account in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, using an interest rate and actuarial assumptions that are reasonable as of that date) and deposits more than the amount required, the employer may claim a refund or credit in accordance with sections 6402, 6413, and 6511. A Form 941c, or an equivalent statement, must accompany each claim for refund. In addition, Form W-2 or, if applicable, Form W-2c must also reflect the actual amount deferred that should have been taken into account.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Lag method.</E> Under the alternative method provided in this paragraph (f)(3), an amount deferred, plus interest, may be treated as wages paid by the employer and received by the employee, for purposes of withholding and depositing FICA tax, on any date that is no later than three months after the date the amount is required to be taken into account in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="120"/>paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), the amount deferred must be increased by interest through the date on which the wages are treated as paid, at a rate that is not less than AFR. If the employer withholds and deposits FICA tax in accordance with this paragraph (f)(3), the employer will be treated as having taken into account the amount deferred plus income to the date on which the wages are treated as paid.</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer M maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is an account balance plan. The plan provides for annual bonuses based on current year profits to be deferred until termination of employment. Employer M's profits for 2003, and thus the amount deferred, is reasonably ascertainable, but Employer M calculates the amount deferred on March 3, 2004, when the relevant data is available.</P>
                  <P>(ii) In accordance with the alternative method described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, Employer M makes a reasonable estimate that the amount deferred that must be taken into account as of December 31, 2003, for Employee A is $20,000, and withholds and deposits FICA tax on that amount as if it were wages paid by Employer M and received by Employee A on that date. In January of 2004, Employer M files and furnishes Form W-2 for Employee A including the $20,000 in FICA wages. On March 3, 2004, Employer M determines that the actual amount deferred that should have been taken into account on December 31, 2003, was $22,000.</P>
                  <P>(iii) In accordance with the alternative method described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, Employer M may treat the additional $2,000 as wages paid to and received by Employee A on December 31, 2003, the estimate date. Employer M may treat the $2,000 shortfall as an error ascertained on March 3, 2004, and withhold and deposit FICA tax on that amount. Form W-2c for Employee A for 2003 must include the $2,000 shortfall in FICA wages. Employer M must also correct the information on Form 941 for the last quarter of 2003, reporting the adjustment on Form 941 for the first quarter of 2004, accompanied by Form 941c for the last quarter of 2003.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Instead, Employer M may treat the $2,000 shortfall as wages paid on March 31, 2004, and withhold and deposit FICA tax on that amount as if it were wages paid by Employer M and received by Employee A on that date. Form W-2 for Employee A for 2004 and Form 941 for the first quarter of 2004 must include the $2,000 shortfall in FICA wages.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasonable, good faith interpretation for amounts deferred and benefits paid before January 1, 2000</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> For periods before January 1, 2000 <PRTPAGE P="121"/>(including amounts deferred before January 1, 2000, and any benefits actually or constructively paid before January 1, 2000, that are attributable to those amounts deferred), an employer may rely on a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), taking into account pre-existing guidance. An employer will be deemed to have determined FICA tax liability and satisfied FICA withholding requirements in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) if the employer has complied with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (g)(2) through (4) of this section, and subject to paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, whether an employer that has not complied with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section has determined FICA tax liability and satisfied FICA withholding requirements in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) will be determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances, including consistency of treatment by the employer and the extent to which the employer has resolved unclear issues in its favor.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Plan must be established or adopted.</E> If an amount is deferred under a plan before January 1, 2000, and benefit payments attributable to that amount are actually or constructively paid on or after January 1, 2000, then in no event will an employer's treatment of the amount deferred be considered to be in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) if the employer treats that amount as taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes prior to the establishment of the plan (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section) providing for the deferred compensation (or, if later, the establishment of the plan as amended to provide for the deferred compensation, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section). If an amount is deferred under a plan before January 1, 2000, and benefit payments attributable to that amount are actually or constructively paid before January 1, 2000, then in no event will the employer's treatment of that amount deferred be considered to be in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) if the employer treats that amount as taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes prior to the adoption of the plan providing for the deferred compensation (or, if later, the adoption of the plan amendment providing the deferred compensation). For example, awards, bonuses, raises, incentive payments, and other similar amounts granted under a plan as compensation for past services may not be taken into account under section 3121(v)(2) prior to the establishment (or, if applicable, the adoption) of the plan.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Certain changes in position for stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other stock value rights not reasonable, good faith interpretation.</E> In the case of a stock option, stock appreciation right, or other stock value right (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) that is exercised before January 1, 2000, an employer that treats the exercise as not subject to FICA tax as a result of the nonduplication rule of section 3121(v)(2)(B) is not acting in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) if the employer has not treated that grant and all earlier grants as subject to section 3121(v)(2) by reporting the current value of such options and rights as FICA wages on Form 941 filed for the quarter during which each grant was made (or, if later, for the quarter during which each grant ceased to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Optional adjustments to conform with this section for pre-effective-date open periods</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If an employer determined FICA tax liability with respect to section 3121(v)(2) in any period ending before January 1, 2000, for which the applicable period of limitations has not expired on January 1, 2000 (pre-effective-date open periods), in a manner that was not in accordance with this section, the employer may adjust its FICA tax determination for that period to conform to this section. Thus, if an amount deferred was taken into account in a pre-effective-date open period when it was not required to be taken into account (e.g., an amount taken into account before it became reasonably ascertainable), the employer may claim a refund or credit for any FICA tax paid on that amount to <PRTPAGE P="122"/>the extent permitted by sections 6402, 6413, and 6511.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Consistency required.</E> In the case of a plan that is not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section), if any payment was actually or constructively paid to an employee under the plan in a pre-effective-date open period and that payment was not included in FICA wages by reason of the employer's treatment of the plan as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, then the employer may claim a refund or credit for FICA tax paid on amounts treated as amounts deferred under the plan (in accordance with the employer's treatment of the plan as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan) for that employee for pre-effective-date open periods only to the extent that the FICA tax paid on all amounts treated as amounts deferred for the employee in all pre-effective-date open periods under the plan exceeds the FICA tax that would have been due on the benefits actually or constructively paid to the employee in those periods under the plan if those benefits were included in FICA wages when paid. If any benefit payments attributable to amounts deferred after December 31, 1993, were actually or constructively paid to an employee under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) in a pre-effective-date open period, but these payments were treated as subject to FICA tax because the employer treated the plan as not being a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, then the employer may claim a refund or credit for the FICA tax paid on those benefit payments only to the extent that the FICA tax paid on those benefit payments exceeds the FICA tax that would have been due on the amounts deferred to which those benefit payments are attributable if those amounts deferred had been taken into account when they would have been required to have been taken into account under this section (if this section had been in effect then).</P>

The adjustments may be made in accordance with section 6205(a) and the regulations thereunder; however, for purposes of § 31.6205-1(b), the error is not required to be treated as ascertained before March 31, 2000.</P>

                <P>(A) With respect to benefit payments actually or constructively paid before January 1, 2000, that are attributable to amounts previously taken into account under the plan, no additional FICA tax will be due;</P>

Thus, paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(B) through (E) of this section apply both to an employer that treated the plan as if it were not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2) (by withholding and paying FICA tax due on benefits actually or constructively paid under the plan during that period, if any) and to an employer that treated the plan as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 3121(v)(2).</P>

For example, in the case of an amount deferred before 1994 that was not reasonably ascertainable (and which was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture), the employer is treated as if it had anticipated the actual amount, form, and commencement date for the benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred and had taken the amount deferred into account at an early inclusion date before 1994 using a method permitted under this section. Thus, with respect to such an amount deferred, the employer is not required to take any additional amount into account when the amount deferred becomes reasonably ascertainable, and no additional FICA tax will be due when the benefit payments attributable to the amount deferred are actually or constructively paid.</P>
                <P>(E) <E T="03">Special rule for amounts required to be taken into account in 1994 or 1995.</E> In the case of an amount deferred that would have been required to be taken into account in 1994 or 1995 if paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section had been in effect, an employer will be treated as taking the amount deferred into account under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the extent the employer takes the amount into account by treating it as wages paid by the employer and received by the employee as of any date prior to April 1, 2000.</P>

                <P>(A) The determination of the amount deferred for any period beginning on or after January 1, 2000, must be made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and the time when amounts deferred under the plan are required to be taken into account must be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, without regard to any such amount that was taken into account for any period ending before January 1, 2000; and<PRTPAGE P="124"/>

                  <P>(i) In 1996, Employer M establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is a nonaccount balance plan for Employee A. All benefits under the plan are 100 percent vested. In order to determine the amount deferred on behalf of Employee A under the plan for 1996 and 1997, Employer M must make assumptions as to the date on which Employee A will retire and the form of benefit Employee A will elect, in addition to interest, mortality, and cost-of-living assumptions. Based on assumptions made with respect to all of these contingencies, Employer M determines that the amount deferred for 1996 is $50,000 and the amount deferred for 1997 is $55,000. In 1996 and 1997, Employee A's total wages (without regard to the amounts deferred) exceed the OASDI wage bases. Employer M withholds and deposits HI tax on the $50,000 and $55,000 amounts. Employee A does not retire before January 1, 2000. Employer M chooses under paragraph (g)(3) of this section to apply this section to 1996 and 1997 before the January 1, 2000, general effective date.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under this section, the amounts deferred in 1996 and 1997 are not reasonably ascertainable (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) before January 1, 2000. Thus, as long as the applicable period of limitations has not expired for the periods in 1996 and 1997, Employer M may, to the extent permitted under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, apply for a refund or credit for the HI tax paid on the amounts deferred for 1996 and 1997 and, in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section, take into account the amounts deferred when they become reasonably ascertainable.</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer N adopts a plan on January 1, 1994, that covers Employee B, who has 10 years of service as of that date. The plan provides that, in consideration of Employee B's outstanding services over the past 10 years, Employee B will be paid a $500,000 lump sum distribution upon termination of employment at any time. On January 15, 1996, Employee B terminates employment with Employer N. Employer N determines, based on a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), that the plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under that section. Employer N treats the $500,000 as having been taken into account as an amount deferred in 1993 and earlier years.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, if all amounts are deferred and all benefits are paid under a plan before January 1, 2000, then in no event will an employer's treatment of amounts deferred under the plan be considered to be in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) if the employer treats these amounts as taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes prior to the adoption of the plan. Accordingly, Employer N's treatment is not in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) because Employer N treated amounts as taken into account in years before the adoption of the plan. As a result, the payment made to Employee B in 1996 was subject to both the OASDI and HI portions of FICA tax when paid.</P>

                  <P>(i) Employer O adopts a bonus plan on December 1, 1993, that becomes effective and legally binding on January 1, 1994. Under the plan, which is not set forth in writing, a specified bonus amount (which is 100 percent vested) is credited to Employee C's account each December 31. A reasonable rate of interest on Employee C's account balance is credited quarterly. Employee C's account balance will begin to be paid in equal annual installments over 10 years beginning on January 1, 2000. Employer O determines, based on a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), that the bonus plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under that section and, therefore, treats the amounts credited from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1999, as amounts deferred and, in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), takes those amounts deferred into account as wages for FICA tax purposes as of those dates. The bonus plan is set forth in writing on May 1, 1999, and, thus, is treated as established as of January 1, 1994.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, if an amount is deferred before January 1, 2000, and the attributable benefit is paid on or after January 1, 2000, then in no event will an employer's treatment of the amount deferred under a plan be considered to be in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2) if the employer treats the amount deferred as taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes prior to the establishment of the plan (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section). Because the bonus plan is treated as established on January 1, 1994 (pursuant to the transition rule for unwritten plans in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section), and because Employer O, in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), took amounts deferred into account in 1994 through 1999, the amounts paid to Employee C attributable to those amounts deferred will not be subject to FICA tax when paid.</P>

                  <P>(i) In 1985, Employer P establishes a compensation arrangement for Employee D that provides for a lump sum payment to be made after termination of employment but the arrangement is not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section). However, prior to January 1, 2000, and in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), Employer P treats the arrangement as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under section 3121(v)(2). Employer P determines that Employee D's total wages (without regard to the amount deferred) for each year from 1985 through 1993 exceed the applicable OASDI and HI wage bases for each of those years and, consequently, there is no FICA tax liability with respect to the amounts deferred for those years. In 1994, Employee D's total wages (without regard to the amount deferred) exceed the OASDI wage base. However, because there is no limit on the HI wage base, the amount deferred for 1994 results in additional HI tax liability of $290, which is timely paid by Employer P.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Employee D terminates employment with Employer P in 1995 and receives a plan payment of $50,000. In that year, Employee D also receives wages of $60,000 from Employer P. In accordance with its treatment of the plan as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under section 3121(v)(2), Employer P does not treat the $50,000 payment in 1995 as wages for FICA tax purposes in that year.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Because amounts under a plan were taken into account (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section) as amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan pursuant to a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2)(A), but that plan is not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the transition rules provided in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section apply. Thus, no additional FICA tax will be due on the benefits paid in 1995.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Because $290 of HI tax was paid on the amount deferred in 1994, Employer P is entitled to a refund or credit for that amount to the extent permitted under sections 6402, 6413, and 6511—but only to the extent that $290 exceeds the FICA tax that would have been due on the $50,000 payment in 1995 if that payment had been subject to FICA tax when paid (i.e., if paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section had been effective for those years). In 1995, Employee D had other wages of $60,000. Thus, only $1,200 (the $61,200 OASDI wage base, less the $60,000 of other wages) of the $50,000 payment would have been subject to OASDI; the full $50,000 would have been subject to HI. This would have resulted in $148.80 of OASDI tax ($1,200 × 12.4 percent) and $1,450 of HI tax ($50,000 × 2.9 percent). Employer P is not entitled to a refund or credit under the consistency rule of paragraph (g)(3)(ii) because the $290 of HI tax paid in 1994 is less than the total $1,598.80 of FICA tax liability that would have resulted if this section had applied for 1995.</P>
                  <P>(v) However, if the benefit payment is instead actually or constructively paid on or after January 1, 2000, the benefit payment must be taken into account as wages when actually or constructively paid in accordance with the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (and paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B) of this section).</P>

                  <P>(i) In 1985, Employer Q establishes a compensation arrangement for Employee E that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. However, prior to January 1, 2000, Employer Q determines, based on a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), that the arrangement is not a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of that section. Thus, when Employee E retires at the end of 1996 and benefit payments under the arrangement begin in 1997, Employer Q withholds and deposits FICA tax on the amounts paid to Employee E. Payments under the arrangement continue on or after January 1, 2000. Employer Q does not choose (under paragraph (g)(3) of this section) to adjust its FICA tax determination for a pre-effective-date open period by treating this section as in effect for all amounts deferred and benefits actually or constructively paid for any such period. The periods in 1994 and 1995 are not pre-effective-date open periods for Employer Q.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section, for purposes of determining whether benefits actually or constructively paid on or after January 1, 2000, were previously taken into account for purposes of applying the nonduplication rule of section 3121(v)(2)(B), any amount that would have been required to have been taken into account before 1994 will be treated as if it had been taken into account within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Under the nonduplication rule, benefit payments attributable to an amount that has been so treated as taken into account is not treated as wages for FICA tax purposes at any later time (such as upon payment).</P>
                  <P>(iii) Because Employer Q does not adjust its FICA tax determination by treating this section as in effect for all amounts deferred for periods ending after December 31, 1993, any benefit payments attributable to amounts deferred in periods ending after December 31, 1993, will be included in wages when actually or constructively paid in accordance with the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

In addition, Employer Q chooses (in accordance with paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(E) of this section) to take the amounts deferred for 1994 and 1995 into account by treating these amounts as FICA wages paid and received by Employee E on January 15, 2000.</P>
                  <P>(ii) In accordance with the nonduplication rule of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, because all amounts deferred for Employee E under the plan were taken into account (or treated as taken into account), any benefit payments made to Employee E under the plan will not be included as FICA wages when actually or constructively paid.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Because Employer Q did not withhold and deposit the FICA tax due on benefits actually or constructively paid before January 1, 2000, Employer Q did not determine FICA tax liability and satisfy FICA tax withholding requirements in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2). Thus, the transition rules provided in paragraphs (g)(3) and (4) of this section do not apply. As a result, any amount that would have been required to have been taken into account under this section before 1994 is not treated as if it had been so taken into account under paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, and benefit payments attributable to amounts deferred before January 1, 2000, are treated as FICA wages when actually or constructively paid in accordance with the general timing rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(i) In 1993, Employer R establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Employee F under which Employee F will have a fully vested right to receive a lump sum payment in 2000 equal to 50 percent of Employee F's highest rate of salary. On December 31, 1993, Employee F's highest salary is $1 million. In accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v)(2), Employer R determines that, for 1993, there is an amount deferred that must be taken into account as wages for FICA tax purposes. Based on Employer R's estimate that Employee F's highest salary will be $3 million in 2000, Employer R determines that the amount deferred is equal to the present value in 1993 of $1.5 million payable in 2000. However, because Employee F has other wages in 1993 that exceed the applicable OASDI and HI wage bases for that year, no additional FICA tax is paid as a result of that amount deferred being taken into account for 1993. In addition, Employer R takes no amounts into account under the plan after 1993 for Employee F. Under paragraphs (e)(1) and (4)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, the largest amount that could have been taken into account in 1993 is the present value of a lump sum payment of $500,000, payable in 2000, because that is the maximum amount to which Employee F has a legally binding right as of December 31, 1993. Employee F's highest salary is, in fact, $3 million in 2000 and Employee F receives $1.5 million under the plan on December 31, 2000.</P>
                  <P>(ii) In accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and (4)(iii)(A) of this section, the determination of the amount deferred under the plan for any period beginning on or after January 1, 2000, and the time when that amount deferred is required to be taken into account must be determined in accordance with this section. In addition, these determinations must be made without regard to any amount deferred that was taken into account for any period ending before January 1, 2000, that could not be taken into account before January 1, 2000, if paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section had been in effect. Because no FICA tax was actually paid on that $1 million in 1993, no overpayment of tax was caused by the overinclusion of wages in 1993 and, thus, Employer R is not entitled to a refund or credit (even assuming that the period of limitations has been kept open for periods in 1993). In addition, because the difference between the present value of the $1.5 million payment and the present value of a $500,000 payment was not taken into account for periods beginning on or after January 1, 1994, $1 million must be included in FICA wages under the general timing rule when paid.</P>

An individual will be treated as an individual party to a March 24, 1983 agreement even if the individual has not accrued any benefits under the plan by March 24, 1983, and regardless of whether the individual has taken any specific action to become a party to the agreement. However, an individual who becomes eligible to participate in a March 24, 1983 agreement after March 24, 1983, is not an individual party to a March 24, 1983 agreement.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">March 24, 1983 agreement. March 24, 1983 agreement</E> means an agreement in existence on March 24, 1983, between an individual and a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(b). Such an agreement does not fail to be a March 24, 1983 agreement merely because the terms of the plan are changed after March 24, 1983. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(6) only, any plan (or agreement) that provides for payments that qualify for one of the retirement payment exclusions is treated as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. For example, § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(b)(4)(v) provides that certain benefits established in connection with impending termination do not result from the deferral of compensation and thus are not considered deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. However, a plan that provides such benefits and that was in existence on March 24, 1983, is treated as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for purposes of this paragraph (b) to the extent it provides benefits that would have satisfied one of the retirement payment exclusions.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Retirement payment exclusions. Retirement payment exclusions</E> are the exclusions from wages (for FICA tax purposes) for retirement payments under section 3121(a)(2)(A), (a)(3), and (a)(13)(A)(iii), as in effect on April 19, 1983 (the day before enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1983).</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Transition benefits. Transition benefits</E> are payments made after December 31, 1983, attributable to services rendered before January 1, 1984. For this purpose, transition benefits are determined without regard to any changes made in the terms of the plan after March 24, 1983, in the case of a March 24, 1983 agreement or after December 31, 1983, in the case of a gap agreement.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Transition rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section, the general statutory effective date described in paragraph (a) of this section applies to benefit payments after December 31, 1983. Thus, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section, section 3121(v)(2) applies, and the retirement payment exclusions do not apply, to benefit payments made after December 31, 1983, even if the benefit payments are made under a March 24, 1983 agreement or a gap agreement.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Transition benefits under a March 24, 1983 agreement.</E> With respect to an individual party to a March 24, 1983 agreement, transition benefits paid under that March 24, 1983 agreement (except for those paid under a 457(a) plan) are not subject to the special <PRTPAGE P="128"/>timing rule of section 3121(v)(2) and are subject to section 3121(a) as in effect on April 19, 1983. Thus, transition benefits under a March 24, 1983 agreement (except for those under a 457(a) plan) to an individual party to a March 24, 1983 agreement are excluded from wages (for FICA tax purposes) only if they qualify for any of the retirement payment exclusions (or any other exclusion provided under section 3121(a) as in effect on April 19, 1983).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Transition benefits under a gap agreement.</E> With respect to an individual party to a gap agreement, the payor of transition benefits under the gap agreement must choose to either—</P>
                <P>(i) Take the transition benefits into account as wages when paid; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Take the amount deferred (within the meaning of § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(c)) with respect to the transition benefits into account as wages under section 3121(v)(2) (as if section 3121(v)(2) had applied before its general statutory effective date).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Determining transition benefit portion.</E> For purposes of determining the portion of total benefits under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that represents transition benefits, if, under the terms of the plan, benefit payments are not attributed to specific years of service, the employer may use any reasonable method. For example, if a plan provides that the employee will receive benefits equal to 2 percent of high 3-year average compensation multiplied by years of service, and the employee retires after 25 years of service, 9 of which are before 1984, the employer may determine that <FR>9/25</FR> of the total benefit payments to be received beginning in 2000 are transition benefits attributable to services performed before 1984.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Order of payment.</E> If an employer determines, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that a portion of the total benefits under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan constitutes transition benefits, then, for purposes of determining the portion of each benefit payment that constitutes transition benefits, the employer must treat each benefit payment as consisting of transition benefits in the same proportion as the transition benefits that have not been paid (as of January 1, 2000) bear to total benefits that have not been paid (as of January 1, 2000), unless such allocation is inconsistent with the terms of the plan. However, for a benefit payment made before January 1, 2000, the employer may use any reasonable allocation method to determine the portion of a payment that consists of transition benefits, provided that the allocation method is consistent with the terms of the plan.</P>

If the employer deducts less than the correct amount of employee tax or fails to deduct any part of the tax, he is nevertheless liable for the correct amount of the tax. Until collected from him, the employee is also liable for the employee tax. Any employee tax collected by or on behalf of an employer is a special fund in trust for the United States.

This rule applies regardless of the employee's filing status or other income. Thus, the employer disregards any amount of compensation or Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) wages paid to the employee's spouse. The employer also disregards any FICA wages paid by the employer to the employee or any compensation or FICA wages paid to the employee by another employer.

The employee representative tax is imposed on compensation received as an employee representative under the rules described in § 31.3211-2. The employee tax is imposed on compensation received as an employee under the rules described in § 31.3201-2. However, if the total compensation received is greater than the applicable contribution base, the employee representative tax is imposed on the amount equal to the contribution base less the amount received for services rendered as an employee.</P>

The entire $20,000 is subject to the sections 3101(b) and 3111(b) rates since the combined compensation is less than $130,200, the applicable contribution base for 1992. The amount of the employee representative compensation subject to the section 3211(a)(2) rate is $1,400 ($41,400−$40,000).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 3221(c) imposes an excise tax on every employer, as defined in section 3231(a) and § 31.3231(a)-1, with respect to individuals employed by the employer. The tax is imposed for each work-hour for which the employer pays compensation, as defined in section 3231(e) and § 31.3231(e)-1, for services rendered to the employer during a calendar quarter. This § 31.3221-3 provides rules for determining the number of taxable work-hours.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Overview.</E> Paragraph (b) of this section defines <E T="03">work-hours.</E> Paragraph (c) of this section demonstrates the calculation of work-hours. Paragraph (d) of this section offers a safe harbor calculation of work-hours for use by any employer in lieu of calculating the number of work-hours for each employee.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of work-hours</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of section 3221(c) and this section, <E T="03">work-hours</E> are hours for which the employee is compensated, whether or not the employee performs services.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Payments included in work-hours.</E> Work-hours include regular time worked; overtime; time paid for vacations and holidays; time allowed for meals; away-from-home terminal time; called and not used, runaround, and deadheading time; time for attending court, participating in investigations, and attending claim and safety meetings; and guaranteed time not worked. Work-hours also include conversion hours, that is, compensation converted into work-hours. Conversion hours may be derived from payment by the mile or by the piece. Work-hours also include time for which the employee is paid for periods of absence not due to sickness or accident disability, such as for routine medical and dental examinations or for time lost.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Payments excluded from work-hours.</E> Certain kinds of payments are not subject to conversion into work-hours. These include those payments that are specifically excluded from <PRTPAGE P="134"/>
                  <E T="03">compensation</E> within the meaning of section 3231(e), such as certain sick pay payments (section 3231(e)(1)(i)); tips (section 3231(e)(1)(ii)); and amounts paid specifically (either as an advance, as reimbursement, or allowance) for traveling expenses (section 3231(e)(1)(iii)). Traveling expenses paid under a nonaccountable plan are excluded from work-hours even though they are includible in compensation. See § 31.3231(e)-1(a)(5). Also excluded from work-hours are amounts representing bonuses, amounts received pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option, and all separation payments or severance allowances.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Hourly compensation.</E> Because the tax under section 3221(c) is calculated on the basis of work-hours, the number of hours for which an employee receives compensation is the figure used to determine work-hours. In the case of an hourly-rated employee, each hour for which the employee receives compensation is one work-hour.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Daily, weekly, monthly compensation.</E> (i) If an employee is paid by the day, week, month, or other period of time, the tax is imposed on the number of hours comprehended in the rate and, if any, the number of overtime hours for which additional compensation is paid. Thus, in the case of an office worker who receives an annual salary based on an 8-hour, 5-day-a-week work schedule that includes paid holidays, vacations, and sick time, the number of work-hours for one month is 174 (2088 hours/year ÷ 12 months).</P>

                <P>(ii) The rule in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is illustrated by the following examples.
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1 A,</HD>

                  <P>an office worker, receives an annual salary that is paid monthly. The salary is based on an 8-hour, Monday through Friday work schedule. <E T="03">A</E> is not paid for overtime hours. <E T="03">A</E> is not expected to work on holidays, during <E T="03">A</E>'s annual vacation, or during periods that <E T="03">A</E> is ill. The number of work-hours for one month is 174 (2088 hours/year ÷ 12 months). This figure remains constant, even though some months have more workdays than others.</P>

However, if <E T="03">B</E> works more than 8 hours during any day, <E T="03">B</E> is paid overtime for each additional hour worked that day. <E T="03">B</E> is not paid for holidays, vacations, or sick time. During May, <E T="03">B</E> worked 6 hours on 4 days, 7 hours on 6 days, 8 hours on 6 days, and 9 hours on 5 days. Because <E T="03">B</E> is paid a daily rate for up to 8 hours, 8 hours are comprehended in the daily rate. Therefore, the number of work-hours for May is 173 (21 days × 8 hours/day + 5 overtime hours), even though <E T="03">B</E> actually worked 159 hours.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Conversion hours</E>—(i) Compensation not based on time (hour, day, month, etc.), such as compensation paid by the mile or by the piece, must be converted into the number of hours represented by the compensation paid. Thus, if an employee is paid by the mile, 1 work-hour equals the number of miles constituting a workday, divided by 8 hours. However, in the case of a collective bargaining agreement that specifies a number of hours as constituting a workday, the number of hours specified under the agreement may be used instead of 8.</P>

                <P>(ii) The rule in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section is illustrated by the following example.
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>

                  <P>C's normal workday consists of 2 150-mile round trips that together take 6 hours. <E T="03">C</E> is paid by the mile. The collective bargaining agreement does not specify the number of hours in a workday. Thus, the number of work-hours for each day <E T="03">C</E> works is 8, or 1 work-hour for each 37.5 miles (300 miles/day ÷ 8 hours/day). If the applicable collective bargaining agreement specifies that 6 hours constitute a workday, the number of work-hours for each day <E T="03">C</E> works would be 6.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculation of work-hours</E>—(1) An employer may calculate the work-hours separately for each employee, as described in the examples in this paragraph. If the employer chooses to calculate work-hours separately for each employee, the employer must calculate the number of regular hours, overtime hours, and conversion hours for each employee for each month. In lieu of separate calculations, the employer may calculate the work-hours for all the employer's employees using the safe harbor formula described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

                <P>(2) The rules in paragraph (c) of this section are illustrated by the following examples.

Also, <E T="03">E</E> was paid for 7 hours on President's Day, even though <E T="03">E</E> did not work on that day. The number of work-hours for February was 161 (21 days × 7 hours a day + 7 overtime hours + 7 holiday hours). The number of work-hours for March was 168 (21 days × 7 hours a day + 21 overtime hours). Because <E T="03">E</E> receives an hourly wage and was paid for the President's Day holiday, the number of hours (7) for which <E T="03">E</E> was paid are added to the hours <E T="03">E</E> actually worked. If <E T="03">E</E> had worked on President's Day and had received extra pay for working on a holiday and holiday pay for 7 hours, the employer would include 14 hours in <E T="03">E</E>'s work-hours for that day, the 7 hours <E T="03">E</E> actually worked and the 7 holiday hours for which <E T="03">E</E> was paid.</P>

If March 16 were on a Friday, the employer would calculate 11 days, or 88 hours.</P>

The employer calculates that <E T="03">G</E>'s work-hours for March were 80, because <E T="03">G</E> worked 9 8-hour days and was paid for an additional 8 hours.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Safe harbor</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> In lieu of calculating work-hours separately for each employee, an employer may use the safe harbor for all employees. If the employer elects to use the safe harbor for a calendar year, the employer must use the safe harbor for all employees for the entire calendar year. If an employer uses the safe harbor for a calendar year, the employer need not elect the safe harbor for the following calendar year. An employer that elects the safe harbor for a calendar year may not subsequently elect to separately calculate employee work-hours for that calendar year.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Method of calculation.</E> The safe harbor treats each employee of the employer as receiving monthly compensation for a number of hours equal to the safe harbor number. To determine the number of work-hours for a month, the employer multiplies the safe harbor number by the number that equals the total number of employees to whom the employer paid compensation during the month.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Safe harbor number defined.</E> The safe harbor number is the number established in guidance of general applicability promulgated by the Commissioner.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Employee defined.</E> Solely for purposes of this paragraph, an employee is any individual who is paid compensation, within the meaning of § 31.3231(e)-1, regardless of the amount, during the month. Thus, for example, a part-time, temporary, or seasonal employee is counted as an employee. A terminated employee is counted in the month of termination (provided the terminated employee received compensation in the month of termination), but not in any subsequent month in which the employee does not perform service for the employer as an employee, even if the terminated employee is paid compensation in a subsequent month. Thus, for example, an employee who terminates employment during the month, receives compensation during the month of termination, and receives a final paycheck the following month is counted as an employee of the employer for the month of termination but not for the following month.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Exception from supplemental tax.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Section 3221(d) provides an exception from the excise tax imposed by section 3221(c). Under this exception, the excise tax imposed by section 3221(c) does not apply to an employer with respect to employees who are covered by a supplemental pension plan, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, that is established pursuant to an agreement reached through collective bargaining between the employer and employees, within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of supplemental pension plan</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A plan is a supplemental pension plan covered by the section 3221(d) exception described in paragraph (a) of this section only if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Pension benefit requirement.</E> A plan is a supplemental pension plan within the meaning of this section only if the plan is a pension plan within the meaning of § 1.401-1(b)(1)(i) of this chapter. Thus, a plan is a supplemental pension plan only if the plan provides for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement. A plan need not be funded through a qualified trust that meets the requirements of section 401(a) or an annuity contract that meets the requirements of section 403(a) in order to meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2). A plan that is a profit-sharing plan within the meaning of § 1.401-1(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter or a stock bonus plan within the meaning of § 1.401-1(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter is not a supplemental pension plan within the meaning of this paragraph (b).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Railroad Retirement Board determination with respect to the plan.</E> A plan is a supplemental pension plan within the meaning of this paragraph (b) with respect to an employee only during any period for which the Railroad Retirement Board has made a determination under 20 CFR 216.42(d) that the plan is a private pension, the payments from which will result in a reduction in the employee's supplemental annuity payable under 45 U.S.C. 231a(b). A plan is not a supplemental pension plan for any time period before the Railroad Retirement Board has made such a determination, or after that determination is no longer in force.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Other requirements.</E> [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Collective bargaining agreement.</E> A plan is established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with respect to an employee only if, in accordance with the rules of § 1.410(b)-6(d)(2) of this chapter, the employee is included in a unit of employees covered by an agreement that the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers, provided that there is evidence that retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between employee representatives and the employer or employers.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Substitute section 3221(d) excise tax.</E> Section 3221(d) imposes an excise tax on any employer who has been excepted from the excise tax imposed under section 3221(c) by the application of section 3221(d) and paragraph (a) of this section with respect to an employee. The excise tax is equal to the amount of the supplemental annuity paid to that employee under 45 U.S.C. 231a(b), plus a percentage thereof determined by the Railroad Retirement Board to be sufficient to cover the administrative costs attributable to such payments under 45 U.S.C. 231a(b).</P>

                <P>(1) Any carrier, that is, any express carrier, sleeping car carrier, or rail carrier providing transportation subject to subchapter I of chapter 105 of title 49;</P>
                <P>(2) Any company—</P>

                <P>(i) Which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by one or more <PRTPAGE P="137"/>employers as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or under common control therewith, and</P>
                <P>(ii) Which operates any equipment or facility or performs any service (except trucking service, casual service, and the casual operation of equipment or facilities) in connection with—</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in transit, refrigeration or icing, storage, or handling of property transported by railroad;</P>
                <P>(3) Any receiver, trustee, or other individual or body, judicial or otherwise, when in the possession of the property or operating all or any part of the business of any employer as defined in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section;</P>
                <P>(4) Any railroad association, traffic association, tariff bureau, demurrage bureau, weighing and inspection bureau, collection agency, and any other association, bureau, agency, or organization controlled and maintained wholly or principally by two or more employers as defined in paragraph (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section and engaged in the performance of services in connection with or incidental to railroad transportation;</P>
                <P>(5) Any railway labor organization, national in scope, which has been or may be organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act; and</P>
                <P>(6) Any subordinate unit of a national railway-labor-organization employer, that is, any State or National legislative committee, general committee, insurance department, or local lodge or division, of an employer as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, established pursuant to the constitution and bylaws of such employer.</P>
                <P>(b) As used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the term “controlled” includes direct or indirect control, whether legally enforceable and however exercisable or exercised. The control may be by means of stock ownership, or by agreements, licenses, or any other devices which insure that the operation of the company is in the interest of one or more carriers. It is the reality of the control, however, which is decisive, not its form nor the mode of its exercise.</P>

                <P>(c) As used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the term <E T="03">casual</E> applies when the service rendered or the operation of equipment or facilities by a controlled company or person in connection with the transportation of passengers or property by railroad is so irregular or infrequent as to afford no substantial basis for an inference that such service or operation will be repeated, or whenever such service or operation is insubstantial.</P>
                <P>(d) The term “employer” does not include any street, interurban, or suburban electric railway, unless such railway is operating as a part of a general steam-railroad system of transportation, but shall not exclude any part of the general steam-railroad system of transportation which is operated by any other motive power.</P>
                <P>(e) The term “employer” does not include any company by reason of its being engaged in the mining of coal, the supplying of coal to an employer where delivery is not beyond the mine tipple and the operation of equipment or facilities for such mining or supplying of coal, or in any of such activities.</P>
                <P>(f) Any company that is described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is an employer under section 3231. In certain cases, based on all the facts and circumstances, it may be appropriate to segregate those businesses engaged in rail services and therefore subject to the Railroad Retirement Tax Act from those businesses engaged exclusively in nonrail services and therefore not subject to the Railroad Retirement Tax Act. The factors considered are set forth in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 31.3231(b)-1</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Who are employees.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) An individual who is in the service of one or more employers for compensation is an employee within the meaning of the act. (For definitions of the terms “employer”, “service”, and “compensation”, see subsections (a), (d), and (e), respectively, of section 3231.) An individual is in the service of an employer, with respect to <PRTPAGE P="138"/>services rendered for compensation, if—</P>
                <P>(i) He is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner in which he renders such services; or</P>
                <P>(ii) He is rendering professional or technical services and is integrated into the staff of the employer; or</P>
                <P>(iii) He is rendering, on the property used in the employer's operations, other personal services the rendition of which is integrated into the employer's operations.</P>
                <P>(2) In order that an individual may be in the service of an employer within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, it is not necessary that the employer actually direct or control the manner in which the services are rendered; it is sufficient if the employer has the right to do so. The right of an employer to discharge an individual is also an important factor indicating that the individual is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of the services. Other factors indicating that an individual is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of the services are the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a place to work by the employer to the individual who renders the services.</P>
                <P>(3) In general, if an individual is subject to the control or direction of an employer merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is an independent contractor. On individual performing services as an independent contractor is not, as to such services, in the service of an employer within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. However, an individual performing services as an independent contractor may be, as to such services, in the service of an employer within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) Whether or not an individual is an employee will be determined upon an examination of the particular facts of the case.</P>
                <P>(5) If an individual is an employee, it is of no consequence that he is designated as a partner, coadventurer, agent, independent contractor, or otherwise, or that he performs services on a part-time basis.</P>
                <P>(6) No distinction is made between classes or grades of employees. Thus, superintendents, managers, and other supervisory personnel are employees within the meaning of the act. An officer of an employer is an employee, but a director as such is not.</P>
                <P>(7) In determining whether an individual is an employee with respect to services rendered within the United States, the citizenship or residence of the individual, or the place where the contract of service was entered into is immaterial.</P>
                <P>(8) If an individual performs services for an employer (other than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer) which does not conduct the principal part of its business within the United States, such individual shall be deemed to be in the service of such employer only to the extent that he performs services for it in the United States. Thus, with respect to services rendered for such employer outside the United States, such individual is not in the service of an employer.</P>
                <P>(9) If an individual performs services for an employer (other than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer) which conducts the principal part of its business within the United States, he is in the service of such employer whether his services are rendered within or without the United States. In the case of an individual, not a citizen or resident of the United States, rendering services in a place outside the United States to an employer which is required under the laws applicable in such place to employ, in whole or in part, citizens or residents thereof, such individual shall not be deemed to be in the service of an employer with respect to services so rendered.</P>

                <P>(10) The term “employee” does not include any individual while he is engaged in the physical operations consisting of the mining of coal, the preparation of coal, the handling (other than movement by rail with standard railroad locomotives) of coal not beyond <PRTPAGE P="139"/>the mine tipple, or the loading of coal at the tipple.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Employees of local lodges or divisions of railway-labor-organization employers.</E> (1) An individual is in the service of a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer (see paragraph (a)(6) of § 31.3231(a)-1) only if—</P>
                <P>(i) All, or substantially all, the individuals constituting the membership of such local lodge or division are employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its business in the United States; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The headquarters of such local lodge or division is located in the United States.</P>
                <P>(2) (i) An individual in the service of a local lodge or division is not an employee within the meaning of the act unless he was, on or after August 29, 1935, in the service of a carrier (see § 31.3231(g) for definition of carrier) or he was, on August 29, 1935, in the “employment relation” to a carrier.</P>

                <P>(ii) An individual shall be deemed to have been in the employment relation to a carrier on August 29, 1935, if (<E T="03">a</E>) he was on that date on leave of absence from his employment expressly granted to him by the carrier by whom he was employed, or by a duly authorized representative or such carrier, and the grant of such leave of absence was established to the satisfaction of the Railroad Retirement Board before July 1947; or (<E T="03">b</E>) he was in the service of a carrier after August 29, 1935, and before January 1946 in each of six calendar months whether or not consecutive; or (<E T="03">c</E>) before August 29, 1935, he did not retire and was not retired or discharged from the service of the last carrier by whom he was employed or its corporate or operating successor, but (<E T="03">1</E>) solely by reason of his physical or mental disability he ceased before August 29, 1935, to be in the service of such carrier and thereafter remained continuously disabled until he attained age sixty-five or until August 1945, or (<E T="03">2</E>) solely for such last stated reason a carrier by whom he was employed before August 29, 1935, or a carrier who is its successor did not on or after August 29, 1935, and before August 1945 call him to return to service, or (<E T="03">3</E>) if he was so called he was solely for such reason unable to render service in six calendar months as provided in (<E T="03">b</E>) of this subdivision; or (<E T="03">d</E>) he was on August 29, 1935, absent from the service of a carrier by reason of a discharge which, within one year after the effective date thereof, was protested, to an appropriate labor representative or to the carrier, as wrongful, and which was followed within 10 years of the effective date thereof by his reinstatement in good faith to his former service with all his seniority rights. However, an individual shall not be deemed to have been in the employment relation to a carrier on August 29, 1935, if before that date he was granted a pension or gratuity on the basis of which a pension was awarded to him pursuant to section 6 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 (45 U.S.C. 228f), or if during the last payroll period before August 29, 1935, in which he rendered service to a carrier he was not, with respect to any service in such payroll period, in the service of an employer (see paragraph (a) of this section).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Employees of general committees of railway-labor-organization employers.</E> An individual is in the service of a general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer (see paragraph (a)(6) of § 31.3231(a)-1) only if—</P>
                <P>(1) He is representing a local lodge or division described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(2) All, or substantially all, the individuals represented by such general committee are employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its business in the United States; or</P>

                <P>(3) He acts in the capacity of a general chairman or an assistant general chairman of a general committee which represents individuals rendering service in the United States to an employer. In such case, if his office or headquarters is not located in the United States and the individuals represented by such general committee are employees of an employer not conducting the principal part of its business in the United States, only a part of his remuneration for such service shall be regarded as compensation. The part of his remuneration regarded as compensation shall be in the same proportion to his total remuneration as the mileage in the United States under <PRTPAGE P="140"/>the jurisdiction of such general committee bears to the total mileage under its jurisdiction, unless such mileage formula is inapplicable, in which case such other formula as the Railroad Retirement Board may have prescribed pursuant to section 1(c) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 (45 U.S.C. 228a) shall be applicable. However, no part of his remuneration for such service shall be regarded as compensation if the application of such mileage formula, or such other formula as the Railroad Retirement Board may have prescribed, would result in his compensation for the service being less than 10 percent of his remuneration for such service.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition</E>—(1) The term <E T="03">compensation</E> has the same meaning as the term <E T="03">wages</E> in section 3121(a), determined without regard to section 3121(b)(9), except as specifically limited by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (chapter 22 of the Internal Revenue Code) or regulation. The Commissioner may provide any additional guidance that may be necessary or appropriate in applying the definitions of sections 3121(a) and 3231(e).</P>
                <P>(2) A payment made by an employer to an individual through the employer's payroll is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for services rendered as an employee of the employer. Likewise, a payment made by an employee organization to an employee representative through the organization's payroll is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for services rendered by the employee representative as such. For rules regarding the treatment of deductions by an employer from remuneration of an employee, see § 31.3123-1.</P>
                <P>(3) The term <E T="03">compensation</E> is not confined to amounts paid for active service, but includes amounts paid for an identifiable period during which the employee is absent from the active service of the employer and, in the case of an employee representative, amounts paid for an identifiable period during which the employee representative is absent from the active service of the employee organization.</P>
                <P>(4) Compensation includes amounts paid to an employee for loss of earnings during an identifiable period as the result of the displacement of the employee to a less remunerative position or occupation as well as pay for time lost.</P>

                <P>(2) Compensation for service as a delegate to a national or international convention of a railway-labor-organization employer is disregarded for purposes of determining the employee tax under section 3201 and the employer tax under section 3221 if the individual rendering the service has not previously rendered service, other than as a delegate, which may be included in the individual's years of service for purposes of the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>

              <P>Every person who is an employer as defined in section 3306(a) (see § 31.3306(a)-1) is liable for the tax. Even if an employer is not subject to any State unemployment compensation law, he is nevertheless liable for the tax. However, if he is subject to such a State law, he may be entitled to certain credits against the tax (see §§ 31.3302(a)1 to 31.3302(c)-1, inclusive). For provisions relating to payment of the tax, see Subpart G of the regulations in this part.</P>

                <P>Under the unemployment compensation law of State X, employer M is required to report in his contribution return for the quarter ending December 31, 1955, all remuneration payable for services rendered in such quarter.

On January 20, 1956, M pays to the State the total amount of contributions due with respect to all remuneration so required to be reported. Such contributions, including those with respect to the remuneration paid on February 1, 1956, may be included in computing the credit against the tax for the calendar year 1955. This is true even though the remuneration paid on February 1, 1956 (if it constitutes “wages”) is required to be reported in the Federal return for 1956 and not in the Federal return for 1955.</P>

                <P>The Federal return of the M Company for the calendar year 1961 discloses total wages of $400,000. The Federal tax, imposed at the rate of 3.1 percent, is $12,400. The company is liable for total State contributions of $8,000 for 1961. The due date of <PRTPAGE P="143"/>the Federal return is January 31, 1962, no extension of time for filing the return having been granted. The contributions are not paid until February 1, 1962. If the contributions had been paid on or before January 31, 1962, the entire amount of $8,000 could have been credited against the tax. (Credits could not exceed 2.7 percent of the wages, or $10,800. See § 31.3302(c)-1.) Since the contributions were paid after January 31, 1962, the M Company is entitled to a credit of 90 percent of the amount which would have been allowable as credit had the contributions been paid on time (90 percent of $8,000, or $7,200), the net liability for Federal tax being $5,200 ($12,400 minus $7,200).</P>

If the contributions had been paid on or before January 31, 1962, the amount allowable as credit would have been $10,800 (2.7 percent of wages of $400,000). Since the contributions were paid after January 31, 1962, the M Company is entitled to a credit of 90 percent of $10,800, or $9,720, the net liability for Federal tax being $2,680 ($12,400 minus $9,720).</P>

The due date of the Federal return is January 31, 1962, no extension of time for filing the return having been granted. The R Company pays $1,700 of the total State contributions on or before such date, and the remaining $1,000 on February 1, 1962.

Since the $1,000 was paid after January 31, 1962, the R Company is entitled to a credit of 90 percent of this amount or $900, plus the credit of $1,700 allowable for the contributions paid on or before January 31, 1962. The net liability for Federal tax is thus $500 ($3,100 minus $2,600).</P>

If, by reason of such other law, the taxpayer was entitled to cease paying contributions for such taxable year with respect to services subject to such other law, the payment into the proper fund shall be deemed for purposes of credit to have been made on the date the Federal return for such year was actually filed by the taxpayer under § 31.6011(a)-3.

Since the contributions were paid to State Y on January 31, 1962, the contributions to State X are, for purposes of the credit, deemed to have been paid on such date.

This additional credit is allowable to the taxpayer with respect to the amount of contributions which he is relieved from paying to an unemployment fund under the provisions of a State law which have been certified for the taxable year as provided in section 3303. Generally, an additional credit is available to an employer, if under the provisions of a State law which have been so certified he is permitted to pay contributions to such State for the taxable year, or portion thereof, at a rate which is both lower than the highest rate applied under such law in such year and lower than 2.7 percent.

              <P>(ii) The amount of contributions (whether or not with respect to employment as defined in section 3306 (c)) he was required to pay under the State law with respect to such year, whether or not paid.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limit on total credits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Paragraph (b) of this section relates to the limitation on the aggregate of the credits allowable under section 3302 (a) and (b). Paragraph (c) of this section relates to reductions, under certain circumstances, of the total credits allowable after applying section 3302 (a), (b), and (c)(1). In paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, relate, respectively, to reductions of credits in respect of advances under title XII of the Social Security Act before September 13, 1960, advances under title XII of the Social Security Act after September 12, 1960, and payments under the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 1958. A reduction of credit under paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section applies separately from, and in addition to, a reduction under any other such subparagraph. See section 3302(d) and § 31.3302(d)-1 for definitions and special rules relating to section 3302(c), and for a provision that, in applying section 3302(c), the Federal tax shall be computed at the rate of 3 percent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitation on aggregate credit.</E> The aggregate of the credit under section 3302(a) and the additional credit under section 3302(b) shall not exceed 90 percent of the tax against which credit is taken, computed as if the tax were imposed at the rate of 3 percent. Thus, the aggregate of the credit which is allowable to an employer for any taxable year shall not exceed 2.7 percent of the wages paid by the employer during the year.<PRTPAGE P="146"/>

The percentage for any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1968, is the percentage reduction for the immediately preceding taxable year plus 0.15 percent.

                <P>In April 1961 the X Partnership terminated after selling all of its property to the Y Corporation. During 1961, the X Partnership paid its employees and former employees a total of $1,000,000 as remuneration subject to contributions under the employment compensation law of a State. (Note that the X Partnership did not qualify as an employer for 1961 for purposes of the Federal unemployment tax, because it had employees during less than 20 weeks in 1961.) When the Y Corporation acquired the property it concurrently employed all individuals who were then in the employ of the X Partnership. Assume that the X Partnership, if it had qualified as an employer for 1961, would have been entitled to a total credit against the Federal tax of $30,000 under section 3302 (a) and (b), without regard to the limits in section 3302(c). Of the $1,000,000 remuneration paid by the X Partnership in 1961, one-fifth (or $200,000) was paid to individuals who were employed by the Y Corporation at the time it acquired the property of the X Partnership. Under section 3302(e), therefore, the Y Corporation is entitled to credit of $6,000, which is one-fifth of the credit ($30,000) which would have been available to the X Partnership.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Remuneration paid after 1939 and before 1955.</E> Whether remuneration paid after 1939 and before 1955 for employment performed after 1938 constitutes wages shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 403 (Regulations 107).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Remuneration paid in 1939.</E> Whether remuneration paid in 1939 for employment performed after 1938 constitutes wages shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of law and of 26 CFR (1939) Part 400 (Regulations 90).</P>
              <P>(b) The term “wages” means all remuneration for employment unless specifically excepted under section 3306(b) (see §§ 31.3306(b)(1)-1 to 31.3306(b)(10)-1, inclusive) or paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The name by which the remuneration for employment is designated is immaterial. Thus, salaries, fees, bonuses, and commissions are wages if paid as compensation for employment.</P>
              <P>(d) The basis upon which the remuneration is paid is immaterial in determining whether the remuneration constitutes wages. Thus, it may be paid on the basis of piecework or a percentage of profits; and it may be paid hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or annually.</P>
              <P>(e) Except in the case of remuneration paid for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business (see § 31.3306(b)(7)-1), the medium in which the remuneration is paid is also immaterial. It may be paid in cash or in something other than cash, as for example, goods, lodging, food, or clothing. Remuneration paid in items other than cash shall be computed on the basis of the fair value of such items at the time of payments.</P>

              <P>(f) Ordinarily, facilities or privileges (such as entertainment, medical services, or so-called “courtesy” discounts on purchases), furnished or offered by an employer to his employees generally, are not considered as remuneration for employment if such facilities or privileges are of relatively small value and are offered or furnished by the employer merely as a means of promoting the health, good will, contentment, or efficiency of his employees. The term “facilities or privileges”, however, does not ordinarily include the value of meals or lodging furnished, <PRTPAGE P="151"/>for example, to restaurant or hotel employees, or to seamen or other employees aboard vessels, since generally these items constitute an appreciable part of the total remuneration of such employees.</P>
              <P>(g) Amounts of so-called “vacation allowances” paid to an employee constitute wages. Thus, the salary of an employee on vacation, paid notwithstanding his absence from work, constitutes wages.</P>
              <P>(h) Amounts paid specifically—either as advances or reimbursements—for traveling or other bona fide ordinary and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer are not wages. Traveling and other reimbursed expenses must be identified either by making a separate payment or by specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and expense allowances are combined in a single payment. For amounts that are received by an employee on or after July 1, 1990, with respect to expenses paid or incurred on or after July 1, 1990, see § 31.3306(b)-2.</P>

              <P>(i) Remuneration paid by an employer to an individual for employment, unless such remuneration is specifically excepted under section 3306(b), constitutes wages even though at the time paid the individual is no longer an employee.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When excluded from wages.</E> If a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement meets the requirements of section 62(c) of the Code and § 1.62-2 and the expenses are substantiated within a reasonable period of time, payments made under the arrangement that do not exceed the substantiated expenses are treated as paid under an accountable plan and are not wages.

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Per diem or mileage allowances.</E> If a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement providing a per diem or mileage allowance satisfies the requirements of section 62(c) and § 1.62-2, but the allowance is paid at a rate for each day or mile of travel that exceeds the amount of the employee's expenses deemed substantiated for a day or mile of travel, the excess portion is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan and is included in wages. In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as a reimbursement, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes when paid. In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as an advance, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes no later than the first payroll period following the payroll period in which the expenses with respect to which the advance was paid (i.e., the days or miles of travel) are substantiated.

              <SUBJECT>$3,000 limitation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) the term “wages” does not include that part of the remuneration paid within any calendar year by an employer to an employee which exceeds the first $3,000 of remuneration (exclusive of remuneration excepted from wages in accordance with paragraph (j) of § 31.3306(b)-1 or §§ 31.3306(b)(2)-1 to 31.3306(b)(8)-1, inclusive), paid within such calendar year by such employer to such employee for employment performed for him at any time after 1938.</P>

              <P>(2) The $3,000 limitation applies only if the remuneration paid during any one calendar year by an employer to the same employee for employment performed after 1938 exceeds $3,000. The limitation in such case relates to the amount of remuneration paid during any one calendar year for employment after 1938 and not to the amount of remuneration for employment performed in any one calendar year.

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>

                <P>Employer B, in 1955, pays employee A $2,500 on account of $3,000 due him for employment performed in 1955. In 1956 employer B pays employee A the balance of $500 due him for employment performed in the prior year (1955), and thereafter in 1956 <PRTPAGE P="153"/>also pays A $3,000 for employment performed in 1956. The $2,500 paid in 1955 is subject to tax in 1955. The balance of $500 paid in 1956 for employment during 1955 is subject to tax in 1956, as is also the first $2,500 paid of the $3,000 for employment during 1956 (this $500 for 1955 employment added to the first $2,500 paid for 1956 employment constitutes the maximum wages subject to the tax which could be paid in 1956 by B to A). The final $500 paid by B to A in 1956 is not included as wages and is not subject to the tax.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              

              <P>(3) If during a calendar year an employee is paid remuneration by more than one employer, the limitation of wages to the first $3,000 of remuneration paid applies, not to the aggregate remuneration paid by all employers with respect to employment performed after 1938, but instead to the remuneration paid during such calendar year by each employer with respect to employment performed after 1938. In such case the first $3,000 paid during the calendar year by each employer constitutes wages and is subject to the tax. In connection with the application of the $3,000 limitation, see also paragraph (b) of this section relating to the circumstances under which wages paid by a predecessor employer are deemed to be paid by his successor. In connection with the annual wage limitation in the case of remuneration after December 31, 1978 from two or more related corporations that compensate an employee through a common paymaster, see § 31.3306(p)-1.

              <P>(4) Substantially all the property used in a separate unit of a trade or business may consist of substantially all the property used in the performance of an essential operation of the trade or business, or it may consist of substantially all the property used in a relatively self-sustaining entity which forms a part of the trade or business.

              <SUBJECT>Payments under certain employers' plans after retirement, disability, or death.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “wages” does not include the amount of any payment or series of payments made after January 2, 1968, by an employer to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents under a plan established by the employer which makes provisions for his employees generally (or for his employees generally and their dependents) or for a class or classes of his employees (or for a class or classes of his employees and their dependents), which is paid or commences to be paid upon or within a reasonable time after the termination of an employee's employment relationship because of the employee's—</P>
              <P>(1) Death,</P>
              <P>(2) Retirement for disability, or</P>
              <P>(3) Retirement after attaining an age specified in the plan established by the employer or in a pension plan of the employer as the age at which a person in the employee's circumstances is eligible for retirement.</P>
              <FP>A payment or series of payments made under the circumstances described in the preceding sentence is excluded from “wages” even if made pursuant to an incentive compensation plan which also provides for the making of other types of payments. However, any payment or series of payments which would have been paid if the employee's relationship had not been terminated is not excluded from “wages” under this section and section 3306(b)(10). For example, lump-sum payments for unused vacation time or a final paycheck received after retirement are payments which the employee would have received whether or not he retired and therefore are not excluded from “wages.” Further, if any payment is made upon or after termination of employment for any reason other than those set out in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section such payment is not excludable from “wages” by this section. For example, if a pension plan provides for retirement upon disability, completion of 30 years of service, or attainment of age 65, and if an employee who is not disabled retires at age 61 after 30 years of service, none of the retirement payments made to the employee under the pension plan (including any made after he is 65) is excludable from “wages” under this section. However, if the pension plan had conditioned retirement after 30 years of service upon attainment of age 60, all of the retirement payments would have been excludable.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Plan.</E> The plan or system established by an employer need not provide for payments because of termination of employment for all the reasons set out in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, but such plan or system may provide for payments because of termination for any one or more of such reasons. Payments because of termination of employment for any one or more of such reasons under a plan or system established by an employer solely for the dependents of his employees are not within this exclusion from wages.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Dependents.</E> Dependents of an employee include the employee's husband or wife, children, and any other members of the employee's immediate family.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Benefit payments.</E> It is immaterial for purposes of this exclusion whether the amount or possibility of such benefit payments is paid on account of services rendered or taken into consideration in fixing the amount of an employee's remuneration or whether such payments are required expressly or impliedly, by the contract of service.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Example.</E> The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

                <P>A, an employee, receives a salary of $1,500 a month, payable on the 5th day of the month following the month for which the salary is earned. A's employer has established an incentive compensation plan for a class of his employees, including A, providing for the payment of deferred compensation on termination of employment, including termination upon an employee's death, retirement at age 65 (the retirement age specified in the plan), or retirement for disability. On March 1, 1973, A attains the age of 65 and retires. On March 5, 1973, A receives $5,500 from his employer of which $1,500 represents A's salary for services he performed in February 1973, and $4,000 represents incentive compensation paid under <PRTPAGE P="158"/>the employer's plan. The amount of $4,000 is excluded from “wages” under this section. The amount of $1,500 is not excluded from “wages” under this section.</P>

With respect to services performed within the United States, the place where the contract of service is entered into is immaterial. The citizenship or residence of the employee or of the person employing him also is immaterial except to the extent provided in any specific exception from employment. Thus, the employee and the person employing him may be citizens and residents of a foreign country and the contract of service may be entered into in a foreign country, and yet, if the employee under such contract performs services within the United States, there may be to that extent employment.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">On or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft.</E> (i) This subparagraph relates to services performed after 1954 “on or in connection with” an American vessel, and to services performed after 1961 “on or in connection with” an American aircraft to the extent that the remuneration for the latter services is paid after 1961.

              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The services are performed under a contract of service, between the employee and the person employing him, which is entered into within the United States, or during the performance of the contract under which the services are performed and while the employee is employed on the vessel or aircraft it touches at a port within the United States; and<PRTPAGE P="159"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) The services are not excepted under section 3306(c). (See particularly § 31.3306(c)(17)-1, relating to fishing.)</P>
              <P>(ii) An employee performs services on and in connection with the vessel or aircraft if he performs services on the vessel or aircraft which are also in connection with the vessel or aircraft. Services performed on the vessel by employees as officers or members of the crew, or as employees of concessionaires, of the vessel, for example, are performed under such circumstances, since the services are also connected with the vessel. Similarly, services performed on the aircraft by employees as officers or members of the crew of the aircraft are performed on and in connection with such aircraft. Services may be performed on the vessel or aircraft, however, which have no connection with it, as in the case of services performed by an employee while on the vessel or aircraft merely as a passenger in the general sense. For example, the services of a buyer in the employ of a department store while he is a passenger on a vessel are not in connection with the vessel.</P>

              <P>(iii) If services are performed by an employee “on and in connection with” an American vessel or American aircraft when outside the United States and the conditions in (<E T="03">b</E>) and (<E T="03">c</E>) of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section are met, then the services of that employee performed on or in connection with the vessel or aircraft constitute employment. The expression “on or in connection with” refers not only to services performed on the vessel or aircraft but also to services connected with the vessel or aircraft which are not actually performed on it (for example, shore services performed as officers or members of the crew, or as employees of concessionaires, of the vessel).</P>
              <P>(iv) Services performed by a member of the crew or other employee whose contract of service is not entered into within the United States, and during the performance of which and while the employee is employed on the vessel or aircraft it does not touch at a port within the United States, do not constitute employment, notwithstanding that service performed by other members of the crew or other employees on or in connection with the vessel or aircraft may constitute employment.</P>
              <P>(v) A vessel includes every description of watercraft, or other contrivance, used as a means of transportation on water. An aircraft includes every description of craft, or other contrivance, used as a means of transportation through the air. In the case of an aircraft, the term “port” means an airport. An airport means an area on land or water used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo. For definitions of “American vessel” and “American aircraft”, see § 31.3306(m)-1.</P>
              <P>(vi) With respect to services performed outside the United States on or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft, the citizenship or residence of the employee is immaterial, and the citizenship or residence of the employer is material only in case it has a bearing in determining whether a vessel is an American vessel.</P>

Furthermore, in determining whether $50 or more has been paid for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business, only cash remuneration for such services shall be taken into account. The term “cash remuneration” includes checks and other monetary media of exchange. Remuneration paid in any other medium, such as lodging, food, or other goods or commodities, is disregarded in determining whether the cash-remuneration test is met.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this exception, an individual is deemed to be regularly employed by an employer during a calendar quarter only if—</P>
              <P>(1) Such individual performs services not in the course of the employer's trade or business for such employer for some portion of the day on at least 24 days (whether or not consecutive) during such calendar quarter; or</P>
              <P>(2) Such individual was regularly employed (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) by such employer in the performance of services not in the course of the employer's trade or business during the preceding calendar quarter (including the last calendar quarter of 1954).</P>
              <P>(e) In determining whether an employee has performed services not in the course of the employer's trade or business on at least 24 days during a calendar quarter, there shall be counted as one day—</P>
              <P>(1) Any day or portion thereof on which the employee actually performs such services; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any day or portion thereof on which the employee does not perform services of the prescribed character but with respect to which cash remuneration is paid or payable to the employee for such services, such as a day on which the employee is sick or on vacation.</P>
              <FP>An employee who on a particular day reports for work and, at the direction of his employer, holds himself in readiness to perform services not in the course of the employer's trade or business shall be considered to be engaged in the actual performance of such services on that day. For purposes of this exception, a day is a period of 24 hours commencing at midnight and ending at midnight.</FP>
              <P>(f) For provisions relating to the exclusion from wages of remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business, see § 31.3306(b) (7)-1.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Services on or in connection with a non-American vessel or aircraft.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Services performed within the United States by an employee for an employer “on or in connection with” a vessel not an American vessel, or “on or in connection with” an aircraft not an American aircraft, are excepted from employment if the employee is employed by the employer “on and in connection with” the vessel or aircraft when outside the United States.</P>

              <P>(b) An employee performs services on and in connection with the vessel or aircraft if he performs services on the vessel or aircraft when outside the United States which are also in connection with the vessel or aircraft. Services performed on the vessel outside the United States by employees as officers or members of the crew, or by employees of concessionaires, of the vessel, for example, are performed under such circumstances, since such services are also connected with the vessel. Similarly, services performed on the aircraft outside the United States by employees as officers or members of the crew of the aircraft are performed on and in connection with such aircraft. Services may be performed on the vessel or aircraft, however, which have no connection with it, as in the case of services performed by an employee while on the vessel or aircraft <PRTPAGE P="162"/>merely as a passenger in the general sense. For example, the services of a buyer in the employ of a department store while he is a passenger on a vessel are not in connection with the vessel.</P>
              <P>(c) The expression “on or in connection with” refers not only to services performed on the vessel or aircraft but also to services connected with the vessel or aircraft which are not actually performed on it (for example, shore services performed as officers or members of the crew, or as employees of concessionaires, of the vessel).</P>
              <P>(d) The citizenship or residence of the employee and the place where the contract of service is entered into are immaterial for purposes of this exception, and the citizenship or residence of the person employing him is material only in case it has a bearing in determining whether the vessel is an American vessel. For definitions of the terms “vessel” and “aircraft”, see paragraph (c)(2)(v) of § 31.3306(c)-2. For definitions of the terms “American vessel” and “American aircraft”, see § 31.3306(m)-1.</P>
              <P>(e) Since the only services performed outside the United States which constitute employment are those described in section 3306(c) and paragraph (c) of § 31.3306(c)-2 (relating to services performed outside the United States on or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft), services performed outside the United States on or in connection with a vessel not an American vessel, or an aircraft not an American aircraft, do not constitute employment in any event.</P>
              <P>(f) The provisions of section 3306(c) (4) and of this section, insofar as they relate to services performed on or in connection with an aircraft not an American aircraft, apply only to services performed after 1961 for which remuneration is paid after 1961.</P>

              <P>(2) Services performed by a father or mother in the employ of his or her son or daughter; and</P>

              <P>(b) Under paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section, the exception is conditioned solely upon the family relationship between the employee and the individual employing him. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, in addition to the family relationship, there is a further requirement that the son or daughter shall be under the age of 21, and the exception continues only during the time that such son or daughter is under the age of 21.</P>
              <P>(c) Services performed in the employ of a partnership are within the exception described in paragraph (a) of this section only if the requisite family relationship exists between the employee and each of the partners comprising the partnership.</P>
              <P>(d) Services performed in the employ of a corporation are not within the exception described in paragraph (a) of this section, except that services performed in the employ of an entity that is treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv)(B) of this chapter may qualify for the exception if the requirements of the exception are otherwise met. An entity that is treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv)(B) of this chapter is not treated as the employer for purposes of applying section 3306(c)(5) and this section.

The Interstate Commerce Commission is hereby authorized and directed upon request of the Board, or upon complaint of any party interested, to determine after hearing whether any line operated by electric power falls within the terms of this proviso. The term “employer” shall also include railroad associations, traffic associations, tariff bureaus, demurrage bureaus, weighing and inspection bureaus, collection agencies, and other associations, bureaus, agencies, or organizations controlled and maintained wholly or principally by two or more employers as hereinbefore defined and engaged in the performance of services in connection with or incidental to railroad transportation and railway labor organizations, national in scope, which have been or may be organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, and their State and National legislative committees and their general committees and their insurance departments and their local lodges and divisions, established pursuant to the constitution and bylaws of such organizations.

A payment made by an employer to an individual through the employer's pay roll shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for service rendered by such individual as an employee of the employer in the period with respect to which the payment is made. An employee shall be deemed to be paid, “for time lost” the amount he is paid by an employer with respect to an identifiable period of absence from the active service of the employer, including absence on account of personal injury, and the amount he is paid by the employer for loss of earnings resulting from his displacement to a less remunerative position or occupation. If a payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost. Compensation earned in any calendar month before 1947 shall be deemed paid in such month regardless of whether or when payment will have been in fact made, and compensation earned in any calendar year <PRTPAGE P="166"/>after 1946 but paid after the end of such calendar year shall be deemed to be compensation paid in the calendar year in which it will have been earned if it is so reported by the employer before February 1 of the next succeeding calendar year or, if the employee establishes, subject to the provisions of section 8, the period during which such compensation will have been earned.<STARS/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) This section deals with the exception from employment of certain services performed in the employ of any organization exempt from income tax under section 501(a) (other than an organization described in section 401(a)) or under section 521. (See the provisions of §§ 1.401-1, 1.501(a)-1, and 1.521-1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).) If the services meet the tests set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, the services are excepted.</P>
              <P>(2) See also § 31.3306(c)(8)-1 for provisions relating to the exception of services performed in the employ of religious, charitable, educational, or certain other organizations exempt from income tax; § 31.3306(c)(10)-2 for provisions relating to the exception of services performed by certain students in the employ of a school, college, or university; and § 31.3306(c)(10)-3 for provisions relating to the exception of services performed before 1962 in the employ of certain employees' beneficiary associations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Remuneration less than $50 for calendar quarter.</E> Services performed by an employee in a calendar quarter in the employ of an organization exempt from income tax under section 501(a) (other than an organization described in section 401(a)) or under section 521 are excepted from employment, if the remuneration for the service is less than $50. The test relating to remuneration of $50 is based on the remuneration earned during a calendar quarter rather than on the remuneration paid in a calendar quarter. The exception applies separately with respect to each organization for which the employee renders services in a calendar quarter. The type of services performed by the employee and the place where the services are performed are immaterial; the statutory tests are the character of the organization in the employ of which the services are performed and the amount of the remuneration for services performed by the employee in the calendar quarter.

For services performed during the first calendar quarter of 1955 (that is, January 1, 1955, through March 31, 1955, both dates inclusive) A earns a total of $30. For services performed during the same calendar quarter B earns $180. Since the remuneration for the services performed by A during such quarter is less than $50, all of such services are excepted. Thus, A is not counted as an employee in employment on any of the days during such quarter for purposes of determining whether the X organization is an employer (see § 31.3306(a)-1). Even though it is subsequently determined that X is an employer, A's remuneration of $30 for services performed during the first calendar quarter of such year is not subject to tax. B's services, however, are not excepted during such quarter since the remuneration therefor is not less than $50. Thus, B is counted as an employee in employment during all of such quarter for purposes of determining whether the X organization is an employer. If it is determined that the X organization is an employer, B's remuneration of $180 for services performed during the first calendar quarter is included in computing the tax.</P>

                <P>The facts are the same as in example 1, above, except that on April 1, 1955, A's salary is increased and, for services performed during the calendar quarter beginning on that date (that is, April 1, 1955, through June 30, 1955, both dates inclusive), A earns $60. Although all of the services performed by A during the first quarter were excepted, none of A's services performed during the second quarter are excepted since the remuneration for such services is not less than $50. A, therefore, is counted as an employee in employment during all of the second quarter for the purpose of determining whether the X organization is an employer. If it is determined that the X organization is an employer, A's remuneration of $60 for services performed during the second calendar quarter is included in computing the tax.</P>

The services performed by A in any calendar quarter during the year are excepted if the portion of the $120 attributable to services performed in that quarter is less than $50. In such case, A is not counted as an employee in employment on any of the days during such quarter for purposes of determining whether the X organization is an employer. If, however, the portion of the $120 attributable to services performed in any calendar quarter during the year is not less than $50, the services during that quarter are not excepted. In the latter case, A is counted as an employee in employment during all of such quarter and, if it is determined that the X organization is an employer, that portion of the $120 attributable to services performed in such quarter is included in computing the tax.</P>

For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of remuneration for services performed by the employee in the calendar quarter, the type of services, and the place where the services are performed are immaterial; the tests are the character of the organization in whose employ the services are performed and the status of the employee as a student enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school, college, or university.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Services performed after 1961.</E> Services performed after 1961 in the employ of a school, college, or university, by a student who is enrolled and is regularly attending classes at the school, college, or university, are excepted from employment (whether or not the school, college, or university is exempt from income tax), if remuneration for the services is paid after 1961.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Services performed before 1962.</E> Services performed in the employ of a school, college, or university not exempt from income tax under section 501(a), by a student who is enrolled and is regularly attending classes at the school, college, or university, are excepted from employment if the services are performed before 1962 or if remuneration for the services is paid before 1962.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the tests are the character of the organization in the employ of which the services are performed and the status of the employee as a student enrolled and regularly attending classes at the school, college, or university described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in the employ of which the employee performs the services. If an employee has the status of a student within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section, the type of services performed by the employee, the place where the services are performed, and the amount of remuneration for services performed by the employee are not material.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">School, college, or university.</E> An organization is a <E T="03">school, college, or university</E> within the meaning of section 3306(c)(10)(B) if its primary function is the presentation of formal instruction, it normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum, and it normally has a regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on. See section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Student Status</E>—<E T="03">general rule.</E> Whether an employee has the status of a student within the meaning of section 3306(c)(10)(B) performing the services shall be determined based on the relationship of the employee with the organization for which the services are performed. In order to have the status of a student within the meaning of section 3306(c)(10)(B), the employee must perform services in the employ of a school, college, or university described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section at which the employee is enrolled and regularly attending classes in pursuit of a course of study within the meaning of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. In addition, the employee's services must be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study at such school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Enrolled and regularly attending classes.</E> An employee must be enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section at which the employee is employed to have the status of a student within the meaning of section 3306(c)(10)(B). An employee is enrolled within the meaning of section 3306(c)(10)(B) if the employee is registered for a course or courses creditable toward an educational credential described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In addition, the employee must be regularly attending classes to have the status of a student. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), a class is an instructional activity led by a faculty member or other qualified individual hired by the school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section for identified students following an established curriculum. The frequency of these and similar activities determines whether an employee may be considered to be regularly attending classes.<PRTPAGE P="169"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Course of study.</E> An employee must be pursuing a course of study in order to have the status of a student within the meaning of section 3306(c)(10)(B). A course of study is one or more courses the completion of which fulfills the requirements necessary to receive an educational credential granted by a school, college, or university within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, an educational credential is a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential granted by an organization described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In addition, a course of study is one or more courses at a school, college or university within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section the completion of which fulfills the requirements necessary for the employee to sit for an examination required to receive certification by a recognized organization in a field.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.</E> (i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> An employee's services must be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study in order for the employee to have the status of a student. Whether an employee's services are incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study shall be determined on the basis of the relationship of the employee with the organization for which such services are performed as an employee. The educational aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the relationship, must be predominant in order for the employee's services to be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. The educational aspect of the relationship is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances related to the educational aspect of the relationship. The service aspect of the relationship is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances related to the employee's employment. The evaluation of the service aspect of the relationship is not affected by the fact that the services performed by the employee may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, whether the educational aspect or the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is predominant is determined by considering all the relevant facts and circumstances. Relevant factors in evaluating the educational and service aspects of an employee's relationship with the employer are described in paragraphs (d)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section respectively. There may be facts and circumstances that are relevant in evaluating the educational and service aspects of the relationship in addition to those described in paragraphs (d)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Student status determined with respect to each academic term.</E> Whether an employee's services are incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study is determined separately with respect to each academic term. If the relevant facts and circumstances with respect to an employee's relationship with the employer change significantly during an academic term, whether the employee's services are incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study is reevaluated with respect to services performed during the remainder of the academic term.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Full-time employee.</E> The services of a full-time employee are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. The determination of whether an employee is a full-time employee is based on the employer's standards and practices, except regardless of the employer's classification of the employee, an employee whose normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week is considered a full-time employee. An employee's normal work schedule is not affected by increases in hours worked caused by work demands unforeseen at the start of an academic term. However, whether an employee is a full-time employee is reevaluated for the remainder of the academic term if the employee changes employment positions with the employer. An employee's work schedule during academic breaks is not considered in determining whether the employee's normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week. The determination of the employee's normal work schedule is not affected by the fact that the services performed <PRTPAGE P="170"/>by the individual may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Evaluating educational aspect.</E> The educational aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances related to the educational aspect of the relationship. The educational aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is generally evaluated based on the employee's course workload. Whether an employee's course workload is sufficient in order for the employee's employment to be incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study depends on the particular facts and circumstances. A relevant factor in evaluating an employee's course workload is the employee's course workload relative to a full-time course workload at the school, college or university within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section at which the employee is enrolled and regularly attending classes.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Evaluating service aspect.</E> The service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is evaluated based on the facts and circumstances related to the employee's employment. Services of an employee with the status of a full-time employee within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. Relevant factors in evaluating the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer are described in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Normal work schedule and hours worked.</E> If an employee is not a full-time employee within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, then the employee's normal work schedule and number of hours worked per week are relevant factors in evaluating the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer. As an employee's normal work schedule or actual number of hours worked approaches 40 hours per week, it is more likely that the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. The determination of the employee's normal work schedule and actual number of hours worked is not affected by the fact that some of the services performed by the individual may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Professional employee.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) If an employee has the status of a professional employee, then that suggests that the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. A professional employee is an employee—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Whose primary duty consists of the performance of work requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study, as distinguished from a general academic education, from an apprenticeship, and from training in the performance of routine mental, manual, or physical processes;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Whose work requires the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Whose work is predominantly intellectual and varied in character (as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical work) and is of such character that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Licensed, professional employee.</E> If an employee is a licensed, professional employee, then that further suggests the service aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. An employee is a licensed, professional employee if the employee is required to be licensed under state or local law to work in the field in which the employee performs services and the employee is a professional employee within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Employment Benefits.</E> Whether an employee is eligible to receive employment benefits is a relevant factor in evaluating the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer. For example, eligibility to receive vacation, paid holiday, and paid sick leave benefits; eligibility to participate in a retirement plan described in section 401(a); or eligibility to receive employment benefits such as reduced tuition, or benefits under section 79 (life insurance), 127 (qualified educational assistance), 129 (dependent <PRTPAGE P="171"/>care assistance programs), or 137 (adoption assistance) suggest that the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. Eligibility to receive health insurance employment benefits is not considered in determining whether the service aspect of an employee's relationship with the employer is predominant. The weight to be given the fact that an employee is eligible for a particular benefit may vary depending on the type of employment benefit. For example, eligibility to participate in a retirement plan is generally more significant than eligibility to receive a dependent care employment benefit. Additional weight is given to the fact that an employee is eligible to receive an employment benefit if the benefit is generally provided by the employer to employees in positions generally held by non-students.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to services performed on or after April 1, 2005.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Services of individuals under age 18.</E> Services performed by an employee under the age of 18 in the delivery or distribution of newspapers or shopping news, not including delivery or distribution (as, for example, by a regional distributor) to any point for subsequent delivery or distribution, are excepted from employment. Thus, the services performed by an employee under the age of 18 in making house-to-house delivery or sale of newspapers or shopping news, including handbills and other similar types of advertising material, are excepted. The services are excepted irrespective of the form or method of compensation. Incidental services by the employee who makes the house-to-house delivery, such as services in assembling newspapers, are considered to be within the exception. The exception continues only during the time that the employee is under the age of 18.</P>

The services are excepted whether or not the employee is guaranteed a minimum amount of compensation for such services, or is entitled to be credited with the unsold newspapers or magazines turned back. Moreover, the services are excepted without regard to the age of the employee. Services performed other than at the time of sale to the ultimate consumer are not within the exception. Thus, the services of a regional distributor which are antecedent to but not immediately part of the sale to the ultimate consumer are not within the exception. However, incidental services by the employee who makes the sale to the ultimate consumer, such as services in assembling newspapers or in taking newspapers or <PRTPAGE P="173"/>magazines to the place of sale, are considered to be within the exception.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Subject to the limitations prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, services described in this paragraph are excepted from employment. Services performed by an individual in the catching, taking, harvesting, cultivating, or farming of any kind of fish, shell-fish (for example, oysters, clams, and mussels), crustacea (for example, lobsters, crabs, and shrimps), sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life are excepted. The exception extends to services performed as an officer or member of the crew of a vessel while the vessel is engaged in any such activity whether or not the officer or member of the crew is himself so engaged. In the case of an individual who is engaged in any such activity in the employ of any person, the services performed, by such individual in the employ of such person, as an ordinary incident to any such activity are also excepted. Similarly, for example, the shore services of an officer or member of the crew of a vessel engaged in any such activity are excepted if such services are an ordinary incident to any such activity. Services performed as an ordinary incident to any such activity may include, for example, services performed in such cleaning, icing, and packing of fish as are necessary for the immediate preservation of the catch.</P>

              <P>(a) (1) Services performed after 1961 by a nonresident alien individual who is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F) or (J) of section 101(a) (15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101), as amended, are excepted from employment if the services are performed to carry out a purpose for which the individual was admitted. For purposes of this section an alien individual who is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under such subparagraph (F) or (J) is deemed to be a nonresident alien individual. The preceding sentence does not apply to the extent it is inconsistent with section 7701(b) and the regulations under that section. A nonresident alien individual who is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under such subparagraph (J) includes an alien individual admitted to the United States as an “exchange visitor” under section 201 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1446).</P>

              <P>(a) If a portion of the services performed by an employee for the person employing him during a pay period constitutes employment, and the remainder does not constitute employment, all the services of the employee <PRTPAGE P="175"/>during the period shall for purposes of the tax be treated alike, that is, either all as included or all as excluded. The time during which the employee performs services which under section 3306(c) constitute employment, and the time during which he performs services which under such section do not constitute employment, within the pay period, determine whether all the services during the pay period shall be deemed to be included or excluded.</P>
              <P>(b) If one-half or more of the employee's time in the employ of a particular person in a pay period is spent in performing services which constitute employment, then all the services of that employee for that person in that pay period shall be deemed to be employment.</P>
              <P>(c) If less than one-half of the employee's time in the employ of a particular person in a pay period is spent in performing services which constitute employment, then none of the services of that employee for that person in that pay period shall be deemed to be employment.</P>

              <P>(d) The application of the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

                <P>Employer B, who operates a farm and a store, employs A to perform services in connection with both operations. A's services on the farm are such that they are excepted as agricultural labor and do not constitute employment, and his services in the store constitute employment. He is paid at the end of each month. During a particular month A works 120 hours on the farm and 80 hours in the store. None of A's services during the month are deemed to be employment, since less than one-half of his services during the month constitutes employment. During another month A works 75 hours on the farm and 120 hours in the store. All of A's services during the month are deemed to be employment, since one-half or more of his services during the month constitutes employment.</P>

                <P>Employee C is employed as a maid by D, a medical doctor, whose home and office are located in the same building. C's services in the home are excepted as domestic service and do not constitute employment, and her services in the office constitute employment. She is paid each week. During a particular week C works 20 hours in the home and 20 hours in the office. All of C's services during that week are deemed to be employment, since one-half or more of her services during the week constitutes employment. During another week C works 22 hours in the home and 15 hours in the office. None of C's services during that week are deemed to be employment, since less than one-half of her services during the week constitutes employment.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(e) For purposes of this section, a “pay period” is the period (of not more than 31 consecutive calendar days) for which a payment of remuneration is ordinarily made to the employee by the person employing him. Thus, if the periods for which payments of remuneration are made to the employee by such person are of uniform duration, each such period constitutes a “pay period”. If, however, the periods occasionally vary in duration, the “pay period” is the period for which a payment of remuneration is ordinarily made to the employee by such person, even though that period does not coincide with the actual period for which a particular payment of remuneration is made. For example, if a person ordinarily pays a particular employee for each calendar week at the end of the week, but the employee receives a payment in the middle of the week for the portion of the week already elapsed and receives the remainder at the end of the week, the “pay period” is still the calendar week; or if, instead, that employee is sent on a trip by such person and receives at the end of the third week a single remuneration payment for 3 weeks' services, the “pay period” is still the calendar week.</P>
              <P>(f) If there is only one period (and such period does not exceed 31 consecutive calendar days) for which a payment of remuneration is made to the employee by the person employing him, such period is deemed to be a “pay period” for purposes of this section.</P>

              <P>(g) The rules set forth in this section do not apply (1) with respect to any services performed by the employee for the person employing him if the periods for which such person makes payments of remuneration to the employee vary to the extent that there is no period “for which a payment of remuneration is ordinarily made to the employee,” or (2) with respect to any services performed by the employee for the person employing him if the period for which a payment of remuneration is <PRTPAGE P="176"/>ordinarily made to the employee by such person exceeds 31 consecutive calendar days, or (3) with respect to any service performed by the employee for the person employing him during a pay period if any of such service is excepted by section 3306(c) (9) (see § 31.3306(c) (9)-1).</P>
              <P>(h) If during any period for which a person makes a payment of remuneration to an employee only a portion of the employee's services constitutes employment, but the rules prescribed in this section are not applicable, the tax attaches with respect to such services as constitute employment as defined in section 3306(c) (provided such person is an employer as defined in section 3306(a) and § 31.3306(a)-1).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 31.3306(i)-1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Who are employees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Every individual is an employee if the relationship between him and the person for whom he performs services is the legal relationship of employer and employee. (The word “employer” as used in this section only, notwithstanding the provisions of § 31.3306(a)-1, includes a person who employs one or more employees.)</P>
              <P>(b) Generally such relationship exists when the person for whom services are performed has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished. That is, an employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but how it shall be done. In this connection, it is not necessary that the employer actually direct or control the manner in which the services are performed; it is sufficient if he has the right to do so. The right to discharge is also an important factor indicating that the person possessing that right is an employer. Other factors characteristic of an employer, but not necessarily present in every case, are the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a place to work, to the individual who performs the services. In general, if an individual is subject to the control or direction of another merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is an independent contractor. An individual performing services as an independent contractor is not as to such services an employee. Individuals such as physicians, lawyers, dentists, veterinarians, construction contractors, public stenographers, and auctioneers, engaged in the pursuit of an independent trade, business, or profession, in which they offer their services to the public, are independent contractors and not employees.</P>
              <P>(c) Whether the relationship of employer and employee exists will in doubtful cases be determined upon an examination of the particular facts of each case.</P>
              <P>(d) If the relationship of employer and employee exists, the designation or description of the relationship by the parties as anything other than that of employer and employee is immaterial. Thus, if such relationship exists, it is of no consequence that the employee is designated as a partner, coadventurer, agent, independent contractor, or the like.</P>
              <P>(e) All classes or grades of employees are included within the relationship of employer and employee. Thus, superintendents, managers, and other supervisory personnel are employees. Generally, an officer of a corporation is an employee of the corporation. However, an officer of a corporation who as such does not perform any services or performs only minor services and who neither receives nor is entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, any remuneration is considered not to be an employee of the corporation. A director of a corporation in his capacity as such is not an employee of the corporation.</P>
              <P>(f) Although an individual may be an employee under this section, his services may be of such a nature, or performed under such circumstances, as not to constitute employment (see § 31.3306(c)-2).</P>

              <P>(3) Since the services described in this paragraph must be performed in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of the farm, services performed by employees of a commercial painting concern, for example, which contracts with a farmer to renovate his farm properties, do not constitute agricultural labor.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Services described in section 3306(k)(4).</E> (1)(i) Services performed by an employee in the employ of a farmer or a farmers' cooperative organization or group in the handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, grading, storing, or delivering to storage or to market or to a carrier for transportation to market, of any agricultural or horticultural commodity, other than fruits and vegetables (see paragraph (e)(2) of this section), produced by such farmer or farmer-members of such organization or group of farmers constitute agricultural labor, if such services are performed as an incident to ordinary farming operations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Generally services are performed “as an incident to ordinary farming operations” within the meaning of this paragraph if they are services of the character ordinarily performed by the employees of a farmer or of a farmers' cooperative organization or group as a prerequisite to the marketing, in its unmanufactured state, of any agricultural or horticultural commodity produced by such farmer or by the members of such farmers' organization or group. Services performed by employees of such farmer or farmers' organization or group in the handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, grading, storing, or delivering to storage or to market or to a carrier for transportation to market, of commodities produced by persons other than such farmer or members of such farmers' organization or group are not performed “as an incident to ordinary farming operations”.</P>

Moreover, since the services described in such subparagraphs must be rendered in the actual handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, grading, storing, or delivering to storage or to market or to a carrier for transportation to market, of the commodity, such services do not, for example, include services performed as stenographers, bookkeepers, clerks, and other office employees, even though such services may be in connection with such activities. However, to the extent that the services of such individuals are performed in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of a farm and are rendered in major part on a farm, they may be within the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Services on American vessel whose business is conducted by general agent of Secretary of Commerce.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Section 3306(n) and this section of the regulations apply with respect only to services performed by an officer or member of the crew of an American vessel (1) which is owned by or bareboat chartered to the United States, and (2) whose business is conducted by a general agent of the Secretary of Commerce. Whether services performed by such an officer or member of a crew under the above conditions constitute employment is determined under section 3306(c) and (n), but without regard to section 3306(c)(6). See § 31.3306(c)(6)-1, relating to services performed in the employ of the United States and instrumentalities thereof. If, without regard to section 3306(c)(6), such services constitute employment, they are not excepted from employment by reason of the fact that they are performed on or in connection with an American vessel which is owned by or bareboat chartered to the United States and whose business is conducted by a general agent of the Secretary of Commerce, that is, such services are not excepted from employment by section 3306(c)(6). For provisions relating to services performed within the United States and services performed outside the United States which constitute employment, see § 31.3306(c)-2.</P>
              <P>(b) The expression “officer or member of the crew” includes the master or officer in charge of the vessel, however designated, and every individual, subject to his authority, serving on board and contributing in any way to the operation and welfare of the vessel. Thus, the expression includes, for example, the master, mates, pilots, pursers, surgeons, stewards, engineers, firemen, cooks, clerks, carpenters, and deck hands.</P>
              <P>(c) An employee of the United States who performs services as an officer or member of the crew of an American vessel which is owned by or bareboat chartered to the United States and whose business is conducted by a general agent of the Secretary of Commerce shall be deemed, under section 3306(n), to be performing services for such general agent rather than for the United States. Any such general agent of the Secretary of Commerce is considered a legal entity in his capacity as such general agent, separate and distinct from his identity as a person employing individuals on his own account. Each such general agent who in his capacity as such qualifies as an employer under section 3306(a) is with respect to each calendar year for which he so qualifies subject to the tax imposed by section 3301, and to all the requirements imposed upon an employer as defined in section 3306(a) by the regulations in this part, with respect to services which constitute employment by reason of section 3306(n) and this section of the regulations.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of sections 3301, 3302, and 3306(b)(1), when two or more related corporations concurrently employ the same individual and compensate that individual through a common paymaster which is one of the related corporations for which the individual performs services, each of the corporations is considered to have paid only the remuneration it actually disburses to that individual (unless the disbursing corporation fails to remit the taxes due). Paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 31.3121(s)-1 contain rules defining related corporations, common paymasters, and concurrent employment, and rules for determining the liability of the other related corporations for employment taxes if the common paymaster fails to remit the taxes pursuant to sections 3102 and 3111, and for allocating these taxes among the related corporations. Those rules also apply to the tax under section 3301. For purposes of applying those rules to this <PRTPAGE P="180"/>section, references in those rules to section 3111 are considered references to sections 3301 and 3302, and references to section 3121 are considered references to section 3306.</P>

In determining the ultimate liability of a corporation, the credit for contributions to State unemployment funds that the corporation may claim under section 3302 is calculated as if each corporation were a separate employer.</P>

Thus, the general exceptions from Federal taxation granted by various statutes to certain instrumentalities of the United States without specific reference to the tax imposed by section 3301 or the corresponding section of prior law are rendered inoperative insofar as such exemptions relate to the tax imposed by section 3301.

              <SUBJECT>Wages.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) The term “wages” means all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer unless specifically excepted under section 3401(a) or excepted under section 3402(e).</P>
              <P>(2) The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is immaterial. Thus, salaries, fees, bonuses, commissions on sales or on insurance premiums, pensions, and retired pay are wages within the meaning of the statute if paid as compensation for services performed by the employee for his employer.</P>
              <P>(3) The basis upon which the remuneration is paid is immaterial in determining whether the remuneration constitutes wages. Thus, it may be paid on the basis of piecework, or a percentage of profits; and may be paid hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or annually.</P>
              <P>(4) Generally the medium in which remuneration is paid is also immaterial. It may be paid in cash or in something other than cash, as for example, stocks, bonds, or other forms of property. (See, however, § 31.3401(a)(11)-1, relating to the exclusion from wages of remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business, and § 31.3401(a)(16)-1, relating to the exclusion from wages of tips paid in any medium other than cash.) If services are paid for in a medium other than cash, the fair market value of the thing taken in payment is the amount to be included as wages. If the services were rendered at a stipulated price, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, such price will be presumed to be the fair value of the remuneration received. If a corporation transfers to its employees its own stock as remuneration for services rendered by the employee, the amount of such remuneration is the fair market value of the stock at the time of the transfer.</P>

              <P>(5) Remuneration for services, unless such remuneration is specifically excepted by the statute, constitutes wages even though at the time paid the relationship of employer and employee no longer exists between the person in whose employ the services were performed and the individual who performed them.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                <P>A is employed by R during the month of January 1955 and is entitled to receive remuneration of $100 for the services performed for R, the employer, during the month. A leaves the employ of R at the close of business on January 31, 1955. On February 15, 1955 (when A is no longer an employee of R), R pays A the remuneration of $100 which was earned for the services performed in January. The $100 is wages within the meaning of the statute.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Certain specific items</E>—(1) <E T="03">Pensions and retirement pay.</E> (i) In general, pensions and retired pay are wages subject to withholding. However, no withholding is required with respect to amounts paid to an employee upon retirement which are taxable as annuities under the provisions of section 72 or 403. So-called pensions awarded by one to whom no services have been rendered are mere gifts or gratuities and do not constitute wages. Those payments of pensions or other benefits by the Federal Government under title 38 of the United States Code which are excluded from gross income are not wages subject to withholding.</P>

              <P>(ii) Amounts received as retirement pay for service in the Armed Forces of <PRTPAGE P="182"/>the United States, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, or the Public Health Service or as a disability annuity paid under the provisions of section 831 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, as amended (22) U.S.C. 1081; 60 Stat. 1021), are subject to withholding unless such pay or disability annuity is excluded from gross income under section 104(a)(4), or is taxable as an annuity under the provisions of section 72. Where such retirement pay or disability annuity (not excluded from gross income under section 104(a)(4) and not taxable as an annuity under the provisions of section 72) is paid to a nonresident alien individual, withholding is required only in the case of such amounts paid to a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Puerto Rico.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Traveling and other expenses.</E> Amounts paid specifically—either as advances or reimbursements—for traveling or other bona fide ordinary and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer are not wages and are not subject to withholding. Traveling and other reimbursed expenses must be identified either by making a separate payment or by specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and expense allowances are combined in a single payment. For amounts that are received by an employee on or after July 1, 1990, with respect to expenses paid or incurred on or after July 1, 1990, see § 31.3401 (a)-4.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Vacation allowances.</E> Amounts of so-called “vacation allowances” paid to an employee constitute wages. Thus, the salary of an employee on vacation, paid notwithstanding his absence from work, constitutes wages.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Dismissal payments.</E> Any payments made by an employer to an employee on account of dismissal, that is, involuntary separation from the service of the employer, constitute wages regardless of whether the employer is legally bound by contract, statute, or otherwise to make such payments.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Deductions by employer from remuneration of an employee.</E> Any amount deducted by an employer from the remuneration of an employee is considered to be a part of the employee's remuneration and is considered to be paid to the employee as remuneration at the time that the deduction is made. It is immaterial that any act of Congress, or the law of any State or of Puerto Rico, requires or permits such deductions and the payment of the amounts thereof to the United States, a State, a Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision of any one or more of the foregoing.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Payment by an employer of employee's tax, or employee's contributions under a State law.</E> The term “wages” includes the amount paid by an employer on behalf of an employee (without deduction from the remuneration of, or other reimbursement from, the employee) on account of any payment required from an employee under a State unemployment compensation law, or on account of any tax imposed upon the employee by any taxing authority, including the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3201.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Remuneration for services as employee of nonresident alien individual or foreign entity.</E> The term “wages” includes remuneration for services performed by a citizen or resident (including, in regard to wages paid after February 28, 1979, an individual treated as a resident under section 6013 (g) or (h)) of the United States as an employee of a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation whether or not such alien individual or foreign entity is engaged in trade or business within the United States. Any person paying wages on behalf of a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation, not engaged in trade or business within the United States (including Puerto Rico as if a part of the United States), is subject to all the provisions of law and regulations applicable with respect to an employer. See § 31.3401(d)-1, relating to the term “employer”, and § 31.3401(a)(8)(C)-1, relating to remuneration paid for services performed by a citizen of the United States in Puerto Rico.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Amounts paid under accident or health plans</E>—(i) <E T="03">Amounts paid in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, <PRTPAGE P="183"/>1977</E>—(<E T="03">a</E>) <E T="03">In general.</E> Withholding is required on all payments of amounts includible in gross income under section 105(a) and § 1.105-1 (relating to amounts attributable to employer contributions), made in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1977, to an employee under an accident or health plan for a period of absence from work on account of personal injuries or sickness. Payments on which withholding is required by this subdivision are wages as defined in section 3401(a), and the employer shall deduct and withhold in accordance with the requirements of chapter 24 of subtitle C of the Code. Third party payments of sick pay, as defined in section 3402(o) and the regulations thereunder, are not wages for purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) <E T="03">Payments made by an agent of the employer. (1</E>) Payments are considered made by the employer if a third party makes the payments as an agent of the employer. The determining factor as to whether a third party is an agent of the employer is whether the third party bears any insurance risk. If the third party bears no insurance risk and is reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is an agent of the employer even if the third party is responsible for making determinations of the eligibility of individual employees of the employer for sick pay payments. If the third party is paid an insurance premium and not reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is not an agent of the employer, but the third party is a payor of third party sick pay for purposes of voluntary withholding from sick pay under sections 3402(o) and 6051(f) and the regulations thereunder. If a third party and an employer enter into an agency agreement as provided in paragraph (c) of § 31.6051-3 (relating to statements required in case of sick pay paid by third parties), that agency agreement does not make the third party an agent of the employer for purposes of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Payments made by agents subject to this paragraph are supplemental wages as defined in § 31.3402(g)-1, and are therefore subject to the rules regarding withholding tax on supplemental wages provided in § 31.3402(g)-1. For purposes of those rules, unless the agent is also an agent for purposes of withholding tax from the employee's regular wages, the agent may deem tax to have been withheld from regular wages paid to the employee during the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) This paragraph is only applicable to amounts paid on or after May 25, 1983 unless the agent actually withheld taxes before that date.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) <E T="03">Exceptions to withholding.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) Withholding is not required on payments that are specifically excepted under the numbered paragraphs of section 3401(a) (relating to the definition of wages), under section 3402(e) (relating to included and excluded wages), or under section 3402(n) (relating to employees incurring no income tax liability).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Withholding is not required on disability payments to the extent that the payments are excludable from gross income under section 105(d). In determining the excludable portion of the disability payments, the employer may assume that payments that the employer makes to the employee are the employee's sole source of income. This exception applies only if the employee furnishes the employer with adequate verification of disability. A certificate from a qualified physician attesting that the employee is permanently and totally disabled (within the meaning of section 105(d)) shall be deemed to constitute adequate verification. This exception does not affect the requirement that a statement (which includes any amount paid under section 105(d)) be furnished under either section 6041 (relating to information at source) or section 6051 (relating to receipts for employees) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amounts paid after December 31, 1955 and before January 1, 1977—(a) In general.</E> The term “wage continuation payment”, as used in this subdivision, means any payment to an employee which is made after December 31, 1955, and before January 1, 1977 under a wage continuation plan (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of § 1.105-4 and § 1.105-5 of Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations)) for a period of absence from work on account of personal injuries or sickness, to the extent such payment is attributable to contributions made by <PRTPAGE P="184"/>the employer which were not includable in the employee's gross income or is paid by the employer. Any such payment, whether or not excluded from the gross income of the employee under section 105(d), constitutes “wages” (unless specifically excepted under any of the numbered paragraphs of section 3401(a) or under section 3402(e) and withholding thereon is required except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8)(ii) (<E T="03">b</E>), (<E T="03">c</E>), and (<E T="03">d</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) <E T="03">Amounts paid before January 1, 1977, by employer for whom services are performed for period of absence beginning after December 31, 1963.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) Withholding is not required upon the amount of any wage continuation payment for a period of absence beginning after December 31, 1963, paid before January 1, 1977, to an employee directly by the employer for whom he performs services to the extent that such payment is excludable from the gross income of the employee under the provisions of section 105(d) in effect with respect to such payments, provided the records maintained by the employer—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Separately show the amount of each such payment and the excludable portion thereof, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Contain data substantiating the employee's entitlement to the exclusion provided in section 105(d) with respect to such amount, either by a written statement from the employee specifying whether his absence from work during the period for which the payment was made was due to a personal injury or to sickness and whether he was hospitalized for at least one day during this period; or by any other information which the employer reasonably believes establishes the employee's entitlement to the exclusion under section 105(d). Employers shall not be required to ascertain the accuracy of any written statement submitted by an employee in accordance with this subdivision (<E T="03">b)(1)(ii).</E>
              </P>
              <FP>For purposes of this subdivision (<E T="03">b)(1),</E> wage continuation payments reasonably expected by the employer to be made on behalf of the employer by another person shall be taken into account in determining whether the 75 percent test contained in section 105(d) is met and in computing the amount of any wage continuation payment made directly by the employer for whom services are performed by the employee which is within the $75 or $100 weekly rate of exclusion from the gross income of the employee provided in section 105(d). In making this latter computation, the amount excludable under section 105(d) shall be applied first against payments reasonably expected to be made on behalf of the employer by the other person and then, to the extent any part of the exclusion remains, against the payments made directly by the employer. In a case in which wage continuation payments are not paid at a constant rate for the first 30 calendar days of the period of absence, the determination of whether the 75 percent test contained in section 105(d) is met shall be based upon the length of the employee's absence as of the end of the period for which the payment by the employer is made, without regard to the effect which any further extension of such absence may have upon the excludability of the payment.</FP>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The computation of the amount of any wage continuation payment with repect to which the employer may refrain from withholding may be illustrated by the following examples:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>

                <P>A, an employee of B, normally works Monday through Friday and has a regular weekly rate of wages of $100. On Monday, November 5, 1974, A becomes ill, and as a result is absent from work for two weeks, returing to work on Monday, November 19, 1974. A is not hospitalized. Under B's noncontributory wage continuation plan, A receives no benefits for the first three working days of absence and is paid benefits directly by B at the rate of $85 a week thereafter ($34 for the last two days of the first week of absence and $85 for the second week of absence). No wage continuation payment is made by any other person. Since the benefits are entirely attributable to contributions to the plan by B, such benefits are wage continuation payments in their entirety. The wage continuation payments for the first seven calendar days of absence are not excludable from A's gross income because A was not hospitalized for at least one day during his period of absence, and therefore B must withhold with respect to such payments. Under section 105(a), the wage continuation payments attributable to absence after the first seven calendar days of absence are excludable to the extent that they do not exceed a rate of $75 a week. Under the principles stated in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of § 1.105-4 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), <PRTPAGE P="185"/>the wage continuation payments in this case are at a rate not in excess of 75 percent (<FR>119/200</FR> or 59.5 percent) of A's regular weekly rate of wages. Accordingly, B may refrain from withholding with respect to $75 of the wage continuation payment attributable to the second week of absence.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>Assume the facts in example 1 except that A is unable to return to work until Monday, February 11, 1975, and that, of the $85 a week of wage continuation payments $35 is paid directly by B and $50 is reasonably expected by B to be paid by C, an insurance company, on behalf of B. In such a case, both the $50 and the $35 payments constitute wage continuation payments and the amount of such payments which is attributable to the first 30 calendar days of absence is at a rate not in excess of 75 percent (<FR>323/440</FR> or 73.4 percent) of A's regular weekly rate of wages. Therefore, under section 105(d), the portion of such payments which is attributable to absence after the first seven calendar days of absence is excludable to the extent that it does not exceed a rate of $75 a week for the eighth through the thirtieth calendar day of absence and does not exceed a rate of $100 a week thereafter. B may refrain from withholding with repect to $25 a week (the amount by which the $75 maximum excludable amount exceeds the $50 reasonably expected by B to be paid by C) of his direct payments for the eighth through the thirtieth calendar day of absence. Thereafter, B may refrain from withholding with respect to the entire $35 paid directly by him since the maximum excludable amount ($100 a week) exceeds the total of payments made by B and payments which B reasonably expects will be made by C.</P>

In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as a reimbursement, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes when paid. In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as an advance, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes no later than the first payroll period following the payroll period in which the expenses with respect to which the advance was paid (i.e., the days or miles of travel) are substantiated.

              <P>(2) In general, services of a household nature in or about the club rooms or house of a local college club or local chapter of a college fraternity or sorority include services rendered by cooks, waiters, butlers, maids, janitors, laundresses, furnacemen, handymen, gardeners, housekeepers, and housemothers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cash remuneration for service not in the course of employer's trade or business.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Cash remuneration paid for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business performed by an employee for an employer in a calendar quarter is excepted from wages and hence is not subject to withholding unless—</P>
              <P>(1) The cash remuneration paid for such services performed by the employee for the employer in the calendar quarter is $50 or more; and</P>
              <P>(2) Such employee is regularly employed in the calendar quarter by such employer to perform such services.</P>
              <FP>Unless the tests set forth in both paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met, cash remuneration for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business is excluded from wages. (For provisions relating to the exclusion from wages of remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business, see § 31.3401(a)(11)-1.)</FP>

              <P>(b) The term “services not in the course of the employer's trade or business” includes services that do not promote or advance the trade or business of the employer. As used in this section, the term does not include service not in the course of the employer's trade or business performed on a farm operated for profit or domestic service in a private home, local college club, or local chapter of a college fraternity or sorority. Accordingly, this exception <PRTPAGE P="191"/>does not apply with respect to remuneration which is excepted from wages under section 3401(a)(2) or section 3401(a)(3) (see §§ 31.3401(a)(2)-1 and 31.3401(a)(3)-1, respectively). Remuneration paid for service performed for a corporation does not come within the exception.</P>
              <P>(c) The test relating to cash remuneration of $50 or more is based on the remuneration earned during a calendar quarter rather than on the remuneration paid in a calendar quarter. However, for purposes of determining whether the test is met, it is also required that the remuneration be paid, although it is immaterial when the remuneration is paid. Furthemore, in determining whether $50 or more has been paid for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business, only cash remuneration for such service shall be taken into account. The term “cash remuneration” includes checks and other monetary media of exchange. Remuneration paid in any other medium, such as lodging, food, or other goods or commodities, is disregarded in determining whether the cash-remuneration test is met.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this exception, an individual is deemed to be regularly employed by an employer during a calendar quarter only if—</P>
              <P>(1) Such individual performs service not in the course of the employer's trade or business for such employer for some portion of the day on at least 24 days (whether or not consecutive) during such calendar quarter; or</P>
              <P>(2) Such individual was regularly employed (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) by such employer in the performance of service not in the course of the employer's trade or business during the preceding calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(e) In determining whether an employee has performed service not in the course of the employer's trade or business on at least 24 days during a calendar quarter, there shall be counted as one day—</P>
              <P>(1) Any day or portion thereof on which the employee actually performs such service; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any day or portion thereof on which the employee does not perform service of the prescribed character but with respect to which cash remuneration is paid or payable to the employee for such service, such as a day on which the employee is sick or on vacation.</P>
              <FP>An employee who on a particular day reports for work and, at the direction of his employer, holds himself in readiness to perform service not in the course of the employer's trade or business shall be considered to be engaged in the actual performance of such service on that day. For purposes of this exception, a day is a continuous period of 24 hours commencing at midnight and ending at midnight.</FP>

The term “employee” as used in the preceding sentence includes not <PRTPAGE P="192"/>only an employee who is a citizen or resident of the United States but also an employee who is a nonresident alien individual. The term “employee” also includes an officer. An organization designated by the President through appropriate Executive order as entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided in the International Organizations Immunities Act may enjoy the benefits of the exclusion from wages with respect to remuneration paid for services performed for such organization prior to the date of the issuance of such Executive order, if (i) the Executive order does not provide otherwise and (ii) the organization is a public international organization in which the United States participates, pursuant to a treaty or under the authority of an act of Congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for such participation, at the time such services are performed.</P>

This exception applies to personnel engaged in railroad, bus, truck, ferry, steamboat, aircraft, or other transportation services and applies whether the employer is a domestic or foreign entity.

              <P>(b) Remuneration paid to nonresident aliens who are residents of a contiguous country (Canada or Mexico) and who enter and leave the United States at frequent intervals is not excepted from wages under section 3401(a)(6).

              <P>(c) Remuneration paid to a nonresident alien individual for services performed in Puerto Rico for an employer (other than the United States or any agency thereof) is excepted from wages and hence is not subject to withholding, even though such alien individual is a resident of Puerto Rico at the time when such services are performed. Wages paid for services performed by a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Puerto Rico are subject to withholding if such services are performed as an employee of the United States or any agency thereof. The place of performance of such services is immaterial, provided such alien individual is a resident of Puerto Rico at the time of performance of the services. Wages representing retirement pay for services in the Armed Forces of the United States, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, or the Public Health Service, or a disability annuity paid under the provisions of section 831 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1081; 60 Stat. 1021), are subject to withholding, under the limitations specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of § 31.3401(a)-1, in the case of an alien resident of Puerto Rico.</P>

See §§ 1.872-2 and 1.1441-4 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). A nonresident alien individual who is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (J) includes an alien individual admitted to the United States as an “exchange visitor” under section 201 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1446).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Remuneration excluded from gross income under section 911.</E> (1) (i) Remuneration paid for services performed outside the United States for an employer (other than the United States or any agency thereof) by a citizen of the United States does not constitute wages and hence is not subject to withholding, if at the time of payment it is reasonable to believe that such remuneration will be excluded from gross income under the provisions of section 911. The reasonable belief contemplated by the statute may be based upon any evidence reasonably sufficient to induce such belief, even though such evidence may be insufficient upon closer examination by the district director or the courts finally to establish that the remuneration is excludable from gross income under the provisions of section 911. The reasonable belief shall be based upon the application of section 911 and the regulations thereunder in Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).</P>
              <P>(ii) Remuneration paid by an employer to an employee constitutes wages, and hence is subject to withholding only to the extent that the remuneration is expected to exceed the aggregate amount which is excludable from the employee's gross income under section 911(a). For amounts paid after December 31, 1984, the determination of the amount subject to withholding shall be made by applying the excludable amount, on a pro rata basis, to each payment of remuneration to the employee. For this purpose, an employer is not required to ascertain information with respect to amounts received by his employee from any other source; but, if the employer has such information, he shall take it into account in determining whether the earned income of the employee is in excess of the applicable limitation. For purposes of section 911(d)(5) and § 1.911-2(c), relating to an employee who states to the authorities of a foreign country that he is not a resident of that country, the employer is not required to ascertain whether such a statement has been made; but if an employer knows that such a statement has been made, he shall presume that the employee is not a bona fide resident of that country, unless the employer also knows that the authorities of the foreign country have determined, notwithstanding the statement that the employee is a resident of that country. For purposes of section 911(d)(1) or § 1.911-2(a) relating to the definition of a qualified individual, the reasonable belief contemplated by the statute may be based on a presumption as set forth in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph. For purposes of sections 911(a)(2) and 911(c)(2) and § 1.911-4(b) and (d)(1), relating to the housing cost amount exclusion and the definition of housing expenses, the reasonable belief contemplated by the statute may be based on the presumption set forth in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) The employer may, in the absence of cause for a reasonable belief to the contrary, presume that an employee will maintain a tax home in a foreign country or countries and be a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries, within the meaning of section 911(d)(1), for an uninterrupted period which includes each taxable year of the employee, or applicable portion thereof, in respect of which the employee properly executes and delivers to the employer a statement that the employee meets or will meet the requirement of § 1.911-2(a) relating to maintaining a tax home and a bona fide residence in a foreign country for the taxable year. This statement must set forth the facts alleged as the basis for this determination and contain a declaration by the employee that the statement is made under the penalties of perjury. Sample forms of acceptable statements may be obtained by writing to the Foreign Operations District, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20225 (Form IO-673).<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If the employer was entitled to presume for the two consecutive taxable years immediately preceding an employee's current taxable year that such employee was a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period which includes such preceding taxable years, he may, if such employee is residing in a foreign country on the first day of such current taxable year, presume, in the absence of cause for a reasonable belief to the contrary, and without obtaining from the employee the statement prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, that the employee will be a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries in such current taxable year.</P>
              <P>(3) The employer may, in the absence of cause for a reasonable belief to the contrary, presume that an employee will maintain a tax home in a foreign country or countries and be present in a foreign country or countries during at least 330 full days during any period of twelve consecutive months, within the meaning of section 911(d)(1), and that such period includes each taxable year of the employee, or applicable portion thereof, in respect of which the employee properly executes and delivers to the employer a statement that the employee meets or will meet the requirements of § 1.911-2(a) relating to maintaining a tax home and being physically present in a foreign country for the taxable year. This statement must set forth the facts alleged as the basis for this determination and contain a declaration by the employee that the statement is made under the penalties of perjury. Sample forms of acceptable statements may be obtained by writing to the Foreign Operations District, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20225 (Form IO-673).</P>
              <P>(4) The employer may, in the absence of cause for a reasonable belief to the contrary, presume that an employee's housing cost amount will be the amount shown on a statement properly executed and delivered to the employer. This statement must set forth the employee's estimation of the following items: housing expenses (as defined in § 1.911-4(b)), the housing cost amount exclusion (as defined in § 1.911-4(d)(1)), and the qualifying period (as defined in § 1.911-2(a)). The statement must contain a declaration by the employee that it is made under the penalties of perjury. Sample forms of acceptable statements may be obtained by writing to the Foreign Operations District, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20225 (IO-673). The employer may not rely on a statement from an employee if the employer, based on his or her knowledge of housing costs in the vicinity of the employee's tax home (as defined in § 1.911-2(b)), believes the employee's housing expenses are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Remuneration subject to withholding of income tax under law of a foreign country or a possession of the United States.</E> (1) Remuneration paid for services performed in a foreign country or in a possession of the United States for an employer (other than the United States or any agency thereof) by a citizen of the United States does not constitute wages and hence is not subject to withholding, if at the time of the payment of such remuneration the employer is required by the law of any foreign country or of any possession of the United States to withhold income tax upon such remuneration. This paragraph, insofar as it relates to remuneration paid for services performed in a possession of the United States, applies only with respect to remuneration paid on or after August 9, 1955.</P>
              <P>(2) Remuneration is not exempt from withholding under this paragraph if the employer is not required by the law of a foreign country or of a possession of the United States to withhold income tax upon such remuneration. Mere agreements between the employer and the employee whereby the estimated income tax of a foreign country or of a possession of the United States is withheld from the remuneration in anticipation of actual liability under the law of such country or possession will not suffice.</P>

              <P>(3) The exemption from withholding provided by this paragraph does not apply by reason of withholding of income tax pursuant to the law of a territory of the United States, of a political subdivision of a possession of the United States, or of a political subdivision of a foreign state.<PRTPAGE P="199"/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Remuneration paid for services performed by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry, or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order, is excepted from wages and hence is not subject to withholding.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Service by a minister in the exercise of his ministry.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, service performed by a minister in the exercise of his ministry includes the ministration of sacerdotal functions and the conduct of religious worship, and the control, conduct, and maintenance of religious organizations (including the religious boards, societies, and other integral agencies of such organizations), under the authority of a religious body constituting a church or church denomination. The following rules are applicable in determining whether services performed by a minister are performed in the exercise of his ministry:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether service performed by a minister constitutes the conduct of religious worship or the ministration of sacerdotal functions depends on the tenents and practices of the particular religious body constituting his church or church denomination.</P>
              <P>(2) Service performed by a minister in the control, conduct, and maintenance of a religious organization relates to directing, managing, or promoting the activities of such organization. Any religious organization is deemed to be under the authority of a religious body constituting a church or church denomination if it is organized and dedicated to carrying out the tenents and principles of a faith in accordance with either the requirements or sanctions governing the creation of institutions of the faith. The term “religious organization” has the same meaning and application as is given to the term for income tax purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) (i) If a minister is performing service in the conduct of religious worship or the ministration of sacerdotal functions, such service is in the exercise of his ministry whether or not it is performed for a religious organization.</P>

              <P>(ii) The rule in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

              <P>(4) (i) If a minister is performing service for an organization which is operated as an integral agency of a religious organization under the authority of a religious body constituting a church or church denomination, all service performed by the minister in the conduct of religious worship, in the ministration of sacerdotal functions, or in the control, conduct, and maintenance of such organization (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) is in the exercise of his ministry.</P>

N University is neither a religious organization nor operated as an integral agency of a religious organization. M is not performing the service for N pursuant to an assignment or designation by his ecclesiastical superiors. The service performed by M for N University is not in the exercise of his ministry.

Thus, for example, service performed by an individual as a chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States is considered to be performed by a commissioned officer in his capacity as such, and not by a minister in the exercise of his ministry. Similarly, service performed by an employee of a State as a chaplain in a State prison is considered to be performed by a civil servant of the State and not by a minister in the exercise of his ministry.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Services of individuals under age 18.</E> Remuneration for services performed by an employee under the age of 18 in the delivery or distribution of newspapers, or shopping news, not including delivery or distribution (as, for example, by a regional distributor) to any point for subsequent delivery or distribution, is excepted from wages and hence is not subject to withholding. Thus, remuneration for services performed by an employee under the age of 18 in making house-to-house delivery or sale of newspapers or shopping news, including handbills and other similar types of advertising material, is excepted from wages. The remuneration is excepted irrespective of the form or method thereof. Remuneration for incidental services by the employee who makes the house-to-house delivery, such as services in assembling newspapers, is considered to be within the exception. The exception continues only during the time that the employee is under the age of 18.</P>

The remuneration is excepted whether or not the employee is guaranteed a minimum amount or remuneration, or is entitled to be credited with the unsold newspapers or magazines turned back. Moreover, the remuneration is excepted without regard to the age of the employee. Remuneration for services performed other than at the time of sale to the ultimate consumer is not within the exception. Thus, remuneration for services of a regional distributor which are antecedent to but not immediately part of the sale to the ultimate consumer is not within the exception. However, remuneration for incidental services by the employee who makes the sale to the ultimate consumer, such as services in assembling newspapers or in taking newspapers or magazines to the place of sale, is considered to be within the exception.</P>

              <P>(a) An amount paid to or on behalf of an employee after March 4, 1964, either as an advance or a reimbusement, specifically for moving expenses incurred or expected to be incurred is excepted from wages, and hence is not subject to withholding, if (and to the extent that) at the time of payment it is reasonable to believe that a corresponding deduction is or will be allowable to the employee under section 217. The reasonable belief contemplated by the statute may be based upon any evidence reasonably sufficient to induce such belief, even though such evidence may be insufficient upon closer examination by the district director or the courts finally to establish that a deduction is allowable under section 217. The reasonable belief shall be based upon the application of section 217 and the regulations thereunder in Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). When used in this section, the term “moving expenses” has the same meaning as when used in section 217. See § 1.6041-2(a) in Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), relating to return of information as to payments to employees, and § 31.6051-1(e), relating to the reporting of reimbursements of or payments of certain moving expenses.</P>

Tips received by an employee in any medium other than cash, such as passes, tickets, or other goods or commodities do not constitute wages. If an employee in any calendar month performs services for two or more employers and receives tips in the course of his employment by each employer, the $20 test is to be applied separately with respect to the cash tips received by the employee in respect of his services for each employer and not to the total cash tips received by the employee during the month. As to the time tips are deemed paid, see § 31.3401(f)-1. For provisions relating to the treatment of tips received by an employee prior to 1966, see paragraph (b)(11) of § 31.3401(a)-1.</FP>

              <P>(a) Remuneration for services performed on or after December 31, 1954, by an individual on a boat engaged in catching fish or other forms of aquatic <PRTPAGE P="205"/>animal life (hereinafter “fish”) is excepted from wages and hence is not subject to withholding if—</P>

              <P>(b) The requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not satisfied if there exists an agreement with the boat's (or boats') owner or operator by which the individual's remuneration is determined partially or fully by a factor not dependent on the size of the catch. For example, if a boat is operated under a remuneration arrangement, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> a union contract, which specifies that crew members, in addition to receiving a share of the catch, are entitled to an hourly wage for repairing nets, regardless of whether this wage is actually paid, then all the crew members covered by the arrangement are entitled to receive cash remuneration other than as a share of the catch and are not excepted from employment by section 3121(b)(20).</P>

              <P>(d) During the same return period, service performed by a crew member may be excepted from employment by section 3121(b)(20) and this section for one voyage and not so excepted on a subsequent voyage on the same or on a different boat.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payroll period.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">payroll period</E> means the period of service for which a payment of wages is ordinarily made to an employee by his employer. It is immaterial that the wages are not always paid at regular intervals. For example, if an employer ordinarily pays a particular employee for each calendar week at the end of the week, but if for some reason the employee in a given week receives a payment in the middle of the week for the portion of the week already elapsed and receives the remainder at the end of the week, the payroll period is still the calendar week; or if, instead, that employee is sent on a 3-<PRTPAGE P="206"/>week trip by his employer and receives at the end of the trip a single wage payment for three weeks' services, the payroll period is still the calendar week, and the wage payment shall be treated as though it were three separate weekly wage payments.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of section 3402, an employee can have but one payroll period with respect to wages paid by any one employer. Thus, if an employee is paid a regular wage for a weekly payroll period and in addition thereto is paid supplemental wages (for example, bonuses) determined with respect to a different period, the payroll period is the weekly payroll period. For computation of tax on supplemental wage payments, see § 31.3402(g)-1.</P>
              <P>(c) The term <E T="03">payroll period</E> also means the period of accrual of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for which a payment of such benefits is ordinarily made. Thus if benefits are ordinarily accrued and paid on a monthly basis, the payroll period is deemed to be monthly.</P>
              <P>(d) The term <E T="03">miscellaneous payroll period</E> means a payroll period other than a daily, weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual payroll period.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Employee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">employee</E> includes every individual performing services if the relationship between him and the person for whom he performs such services is the legal relationship of employer and employee. The term includes officers and employees, whether elected or appointed, of the United States, a State, Territory, Puerto Rico, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing.</P>
              <P>(b) Generally the relationship of employer and employee exists when the person for whom services are performed has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished. That is, an employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but how it shall be done. In this connection, it is not necessary that the employer actually direct or control the manner in which the services are performed; it is sufficient if he has the right to do so. The right to discharge is also an important factor indicating that the person possessing that right is an employer. Other factors characteristic of an employer, but not necessarily present in every case, are the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a place to work to the individual who performs the services. In general, if an individual is subject to the control or direction of another merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is not an employee.</P>
              <P>(c) Generally, physicians, lawyers, dentists, veterinarians, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, auctioneers, and others who follow an independent trade, business, or profession, in which they offer their services to the public, are not employees.</P>
              <P>(d) Whether the relationship of employer and employee exists will in doubtful cases be determined upon an examination of the particular facts of each case.</P>
              <P>(e) If the relationship of employer and employee exists, the designation or description of the relationship by the parties as anything other than that of employer and employee is immaterial. Thus, if such relationship exists, it is of no consequence that the employee is designated as a partner, coadventurer, agent, independent contractor, or the like.</P>

              <P>(f) All classes or grades of employees are included within the relationship of employer and employee. Thus, superintendents, managers and other supervisory personnel are employees. Generally, an officer of a corporation is an employee of the corporation. However, an officer of a corporation who as such does not perform any services or performs only minor services and who neither receives nor is entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, any remuneration is not considered to be an employee of the corporation. A director of <PRTPAGE P="207"/>a corporation in his capacity as such is not an employee of the corporation.</P>
              <P>(g) The term <E T="03">employee</E> includes every individual who receives a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit which is treated under paragraph (b)(14) of § 31.3401(a)-1 as if it were wages.</P>
              <P>(h) Although an individual may be an employee under this section, his services may be of such a nature, or performed under such circumstances, that the remuneration paid for such services does not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3401(a).</P>

              <P>(b) It is not necessary that the services be continuing at the time the wages are paid in order that the status of employer exist. Thus, for purposes of withholding, a person for whom an individual has performed past services for which he is still receiving wages from such person is an <E T="03">employer.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) An employer may be an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust, an estate, a joint-stock company, an association, or a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization, group or entity. A trust or estate, rather than the fiduciary acting for or on behalf of the trust or estate, is generally the employer.</P>
              <P>(d) The term <E T="03">employer</E> embraces not only individuals and organizations engaged in trade or business, but organizations exempt from income tax, such as religious and charitable organizations, educational institutions, clubs, social organizations and societies, as well as the governments of the United States, the States, Territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, including their agencies, instrumentalities, and political subdivisions.</P>
              <P>(e) The term <E T="03">employer</E> also means (except for the purpose of the definition of <E T="03">wages</E>) any person paying wages on behalf of a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation, not engaged in trade or business within the United States (including Puerto Rico as if a part of the United States).</P>

              <P>(f) If the person for whom the services are or were performed does not have legal control of the payment of the wages for such services, the term <E T="03">employer</E> means (except for the purpose of the definition of <E T="03">wages</E>) the person having such control. For example, where wages, such as certain types of pensions or retired pay, are paid by a trust and the person for whom the services were performed has no legal control over the payment of such wages, the trust is the <E T="03">employer.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(g) The term <E T="03">employer</E> also means a person making a payment of a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit which is treated under paragraph (b)(14) of § 31.3401(a)-1 as if it were wages. For example, if supplemental unemployment compensation benefits are paid from a trust which was created under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the trust shall generally be deemed to be the employer. However, if the person making such payment is acting solely as an agent for another person, the term <E T="03">employer</E> shall mean such other person and not the person actually making the payment.</P>

              <P>(h) It is a basic purpose to centralize in the employer the responsibility for withholding, returning, and paying the tax, and for furnishing the statements required under section 6051 and § 31.6051-1. The special definitions of the term <E T="03">employer</E> in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section are designed solely to meet special or unusual situations. They are not intended as a departure from the basic purpose.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirement of withholding.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Section 3402 provides alternative methods, at the election of the employer, for use in computing the amount of income tax to be collected at source on wages. Under the percentage method of withholding (see § 31.3402(b)-1), the employer is required to deduct and withhold a tax computed in accordance with the provisions of section 3402(a). Under the wage bracket method of withholding (see § 31.3402(c)-1), the employer is required to deduct and withhold a tax determined in accordance with the provisions of section 3402(c). The employer may elect to use the percentage method, the wage bracket method, or certain other methods (see § 31.3402(h) (4)-1). Different methods may be used by the employer with respect to different groups of employees.</P>
              <P>(b) The employer is required to collect the tax by deducting and withholding the amount thereof from the employee's wages as and when paid, either actually or constructively. Wages are constructively paid when they are credited to the account of or set apart for an employee so that they may be drawn upon by him at any time although not then actually reduced to possession. To constitute payment in such a case, the wages must be credited to or set apart for the employee without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and must be made available to him so that they may be drawn upon at any time, and their payment brought within his own control and disposition.</P>

              <P>(c) Except as provided in sections 3402 (j) and (k) (see §§ 31.3402(j)-1 and 31.3402(k)-1, relating to noncash remuneration paid to retail commission salesman and to tips received by an employee in the course of his employment, respectively), an employer is required to deduct and withhold the tax notwithstanding the wages are paid in something other than money (for example, wages paid in stocks or bonds; <PRTPAGE P="209"/>see § 31.3401 (a)-1) and to pay over the tax in money. If wages are paid in property other than money, the employer should make necessary arrangements to insure that the amount of the tax required to be withheld is available for payment in money.</P>
              <P>(d) For provisions relating to the circumstances under which tax is required to be deducted and withheld from certain amounts received under accident and health plans, see paragraph (b)(8) of § 31.3401(a)-1.</P>
              <P>(e) As a matter of business administration, certain of the mechanical details of the withholding process may be handled by representatives of the employer. Thus, in the case of an employer having branch offices, the branch manager or other representative may actually, as a matter of internal administration, withhold the tax or prepare the statements required under section 6051. Nevertheless, the legal responsibility for withholding, paying, and returning the tax and furnishing such statements rests with the employer. For provisions relating to statements under section 6051, see § 31.6051-1.</P>
              <P>(f) The amount of any tax withheld and collected by the employer is a special fund in trust for the United States. See section 7501.</P>

Where the withholding is computed under the rules applicable to a miscellaneous payroll period, the wages and the amounts shown in the applicable table must be placed on a comparable basis. This may be accomplished by reducing the wages paid for the period to a daily basis by dividing the total wages by the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the period. The amount of the tax shown in the applicable table as the tax required to be withheld from the wages, as so reduced to a daily basis, should then be multiplied by the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the period.</P>

An employee may also be entitled under section 3402(m) to withholding exemptions with respect to withholding allowances (see § 31.3402(m)-1).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Withholding exemptions to which an employee is entitled in respect to his spouse.</E> (1) A married employee, whose spouse is an employee receiving wages, is entitled to claim any withholding exemption to which his spouse is entitled under paragraph (b) of this section, unless the spouse has in effect a withholding exemption certificate claiming such withholding exemption. A married employee, whose spouse is not an employee receiving wages, is entitled to claim any withholding exemption to which his spouse would be entitled under paragraph (b) of this section if the spouse were an employee receiving wages.

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>Assume that both the husband and wife have attained the age of 65 and are employees receiving wages. Each spouse is entitled under paragraph (b) of this section to claim 2 withholding exemptions in respect of himself or herself. Either spouse may claim, in addition to the withholding exemptions to which he or she is entitled in respect of himself or herself, any withholding exemption to which the other spouse is entitled under such paragraph (b) of this section but does not claim on a withholding exemption certificate.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that only the husband is an employee receiving wages. The husband is entitled to claim 4 withholding exemptions, that is, the 2 withholding exemptions to which he is entitled in respect of himself and the 2 withholding exemptions to which his spouse would be entitled under paragraph (b) of this section if she were an employee receiving wages.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(2) In determining the number of withholding exemptions to which an employee is entitled for himself and his spouse on any day, the employee's status as a single person or a married person and, if married, whether a withholding exemption is claimed by his spouse, shall be determined as of such day. However, in the case of an employee whose spouse dies in the taxable year of the employee which begins in, or with, the calendar year in which the spouse dies, any withholding exemption which would be allowable to the employee in respect of such spouse, if living and not an employee receiving wages, may be claimed by the employee for that portion of the calendar year which occurs after his spouse's death. For provisions applicable in the case of an employee whose taxable year is not a calendar year, and whose spouse dies in that portion of the calendar year which precedes the first day of the taxable year of the employee which begins in the calendar year, see paragraph (b) of § 31.3402(f)(2)-1. An employee legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance or an employee who is a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2 and the regulations thereunder) shall not be entitled to any withholding exemptions in respect of his spouse.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Withholding exemptions to which an employee is entitled in respect of dependents.</E> Subject to the limitations stated in this paragraph, an employee shall be entitled on any day to a withholding exemption for each individual who may reasonably be expected to be his dependent for his taxable year beginning in, or with, the calendar year in which such day falls. For purposes of the withholding exemption for an individual who may reasonably be expected to be a dependent, the following rules shall apply:</P>

              <P>(1) The determination that an individual may or may not reasonably be expected to be a dependent shall be made on the basis of facts existing at <PRTPAGE P="214"/>the beginning of the day for which a withholding exemption for such individual is to be claimed. The individual in respect of whom an exemption is claimed by an employee must, on the day in question, be in existence and be within one of the categories listed in section 152(a), which defines the term “dependent”. However, a withholding exemption for a dependent who dies continues for the portion of the calendar year which occurs after the dependent's death, except that, in the case of an employee whose taxable year is not a calendar year, the withholding exemption does not continue for a dependent, within the meaning of section 152(a) (9) or (10), whose death occurs before the first day of the employee's taxable year beginning in the calendar year of death.</P>
              <P>(2) The determination that an individual may or may not reasonably be expected to be a dependent shall be made for the taxable year of the employee in respect of which amounts deducted and withheld in the calendar year in which the day in question falls are allowed as a credit. In general, amounts deducted and withheld during any calendar year are allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year which begins in, or with, such calendar year. Thus, in order for an employee to be able to claim for a calendar year a withholding exemption with respect to a particular individual as a dependent there must be a reasonable expectation that the employee will be allowed an exemption with respect to such individual under section 151(e) for his taxable year which begins in, or with, such calendar year.</P>
              <P>(3) For the employee to be entitled on any day of the calendar year to a withholding exemption for an individual as a dependent, such individual must on such day—</P>
              <P>(i) Be an individual referred to in one of the numbered paragraphs in section 152(a),</P>
              <P>(ii) Reasonably be expected to receive over one-half of his support, within the meaning of section 152, from the employee in the calendar year, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Either (<E T="03">a</E>) reasonably be expected to have gross income of less than the amount determined pursuant to § 1.151-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) applicable to the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins, or (<E T="03">b</E>) be a child (son, stepson, daughter, stepdaughter, adopted son, or adopted daughter) of the employee who (<E T="03">1</E>) will not have attained the age of 19 at the close of the calendar year or (<E T="03">2</E>) is a student as defined in section 151.</P>
              <P>(4) An employee is not entitled to claim a withholding exemption for an individual otherwise reasonably expected to be a dependent of the employee if such individual is not a citizen of the United States, unless such individual (i) is at any time during the calendar year a resident of the United States (including, in regard to wages paid after February 28, 1979, and individual treated as a resident under section 6013 (g) or (h)) Canada, Mexico, the Canal Zone, or the Republic of Panama, or (ii) is a child of the employee born to him, or legally adopted by him, in the Philippine Islands before January 1, 1956, and the child is a resident of the Republic of the Philippines, and the employee was a member of the Armed Forces of the United States at the time the child was born to him or legally adopted by him.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional withholding exemption to which an employee is entitled in respect of the standard deduction.</E> After November 30, 1986, an employee is entitled to one additional withholding exemption unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee is married (as determined under section 143) and the employee's spouse is an employee receiving wages subject to withholding, or</P>
              <P>(2) The employee has withholding exemption certificates in effect with respect to more than one employer.</P>

              <FP>These restrictions do not apply if the combined wages of the employee and the spouse (if any) from other than one employer is less than the amount specified in the instructions to Form W-4 <PRTPAGE P="215"/>or W-4A (Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate).</FP>

              <SUBJECT>Withholding exemption certificates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">On commencement of employment.</E> On or before the date on which an individual commences employment with an employer, the individual shall furnish the employer with a signed withholding exemption certificate relating to his marital status and the number of withholding exemptions which he claims, which number shall in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled, or, if the statements described in § 31.3402(n)-1 are true with respect to an individual, he may furnish his employer with a signed withholding exemption certificate which contains such statements. For form and contents of such certificates, see § 31.3402(f)(5)-1. The employer is required to request a withholding exemption certificate from each employee, but if the employee fails to furnish such certificate, such employee shall be considered as a single person claiming no withholding exemptions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Change in status which affects calendar year.</E> (1) If, on any day during the calendar year, the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the number of withholding exemptions claimed by him on the withholding exemption certificate then in effect, the employee must within 10 days after the change occurs furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which must in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled on such day. The number of withholding exemptions to which an employee is entitled decreases, for example, for any one of the following reasons:</P>

              <P>(i) The employee's wife (or husband) for whom the employee has been claiming a withholding exemption (<E T="03">a</E>) is divorced or legally separated from the employee, or (<E T="03">b</E>) claims her (or his) own withholding exemption on a separate certificate.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of an employee whose taxable year is not a calendar year, the employee's wife (or husband) for whom the employee has been claiming a withholding exemption dies in that portion of the calendar year which precedes the first day of the taxable year of the employee which begins in the calendar year in which the spouse dies.</P>
              <P>(iii) The employee finds that no exemption for his taxable year which begins in, or with, the current calendar year will be allowable to him under section 151(e) in respect of an individual claimed as a dependent on the employee's withholding exemption certificate.</P>
              <P>(iv) It becomes unreasonable for the employee to believe that his wages for an estimation year will not be more, or that the determinable additional amounts for each item under § 31.3402(m)-1 for an estimation year will not be less, than the corresponding figure used in connection with a claim by him under section 3402 (m) of a withholding allowance to such an extent that the employee would no longer be entitled to such withholding allowance.</P>
              <P>(v) It becomes unreasonable for an employee who has in effect a withholding exemption certificate on which he claims a withholding allowance under section 3402(m), computed on the basis of the preceding taxable year, to believe that his wages and the determinable additional amounts for each item under § 31.3402(m)-1 in such preceding taxable year or in his present taxable year will entitle him to such withholding allowance in the present taxable year.</P>

              <P>(2) If, on any day during the calendar year, the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is more than the number of withholding exemptions claimed by him on the withholding exemption certificate then in effect, the employee may furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate on which the employee must in no event claim more than the number of withholding exemptions to which he is entitled on such day.<PRTPAGE P="216"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) If, on any day during the calendar year, the statements described in § 31.3402(n)-1 are true with respect to an employee, such employee may furnish his employer with a withholding exemption certificate which contains such statements.</P>
              <P>(4) If, on any day during the calendar year, it is not reasonable for an employee, who has furnished his employer with a withholding exemption certificate which contains the statements described in § 31.3402(n)-1, to anticipate that he will incur no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A (as defined in § 31.3402(n)-1) for his current taxable year, the employee must within 10 days after such day furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate which does not contain such statements. If, on any day during the calendar year, it is not reasonable for such an employee whose liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A is determined on a basis other than the calendar year to so anticipate with respect to his taxable year following his current taxable year, the employee must furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate which does not contain such statements within 10 days after such day or on or before the first day of the last month of his current taxable year, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Change in status which affects next calendar year.</E> (1) If, on any day during the calendar year, the number of exemptions to which the employee will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, entitled under sections 151 and 3402(m) for his taxable year which begins in, or with, the next calendar year is different from the number to which the employee is entitled on such day, the following rules shall be applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) If such number is less than the number of withholding exemptions claimed by the employee on a withholding exemption certificate in effect in such day, the employee must, on or before December 1 of the year in which the change occurs, unless such change occurs in December, furnish his employer with a new withholding exemption certificate reflecting the decrease in the number of withholding exemptions. If the change occurs in December, the new certificate must be furnished within 10 days after the change occurs. The number of exemptions to which an employee is entitled for his taxable year which begins in, or with, the next calendar year decreases, for example, for any of the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The spouse or a dependent of the employee dies.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The employee finds that is not reasonable to expect that an individual claimed as a dependent on the employee's withholding exemption certificate will qualify as a dependent of the employee for such taxable year.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) It becomes unreasonable for an employee who has in effect a withholding exemption certificate on which he claims a withholding allowance under section 3402(m) to believe that his wages and the determinable additional amounts for each item under § 31.3402(m)-1 for his taxable year which begins in, or with, the next calendar year will entitle him to such withholding allowance for such taxable year.</P>
              <P>(ii) If such number is greater than the number of withholding exemptions claimed by the employee on a withholding exemption certificate in effect on such day, the employee may, on or before December 1 of the year in which such change occurs, unless such change occurs in December, furnish his employer with a new withholding exemption certificate reflecting the increase in the number of withholding exemptions. If the change occurs in December, the certificate may be furnished on or after the date on which the change occurs.</P>

              <P>(2) If, on any day during the calendar year, it is not reasonable for an employee, who has furnished his employer with a withholding exemption certificate which contains the statements described in § 31.3402(n)-1 and whose liability for such tax is determined on a calendar-year basis, to anticipate that he will incur no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A (as defined in § 3l.3402(n)-1) for his taxable year which begins with the next calendar year, the employee must furnish his employer with a new withholding exemption certificate which does not contain such statements, on or before <PRTPAGE P="217"/>December 1 of the first-mentioned calendar year. If it first becomes unreasonable for the employee to so anticipate in December, the new certificate must be furnished within 10 days after the day on which it first becomes unreasonable for the employee to so anticipate.</P>
              <P>(3) Before December 1 of each year, every employer should request each of his employees to file a new withholding exemption certificate for the ensuing calendar year, in the event of change in the employee's exemption status since the filing of his latest certificate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inclusion of account number on withholding exemption certificate.</E> Every individual to whom an account number has been assigned shall include such number of any withholding exemption certificate filed with an employer. For provisions relating to the obtaining of an account number, see § 31.6011 (b)-2.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Invalid withholding exemption certificates.</E> Any alteration of or unauthorized addition to a withholding exemption certificate shall cause such certificate to be invalid; see paragraph (b) of § 31.3402(f)(5)-1 for the definitions of alteration and unauthorized addition. Any withholding exemption certificate which the employee clearly indicates to be false by an oral statement or by a written statement (other than one made on the withholding exemption certificate itself) made by him to the employer on or before the date on which the employee furnishes such certificate is also invalid. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “employer” includes any individual authorized by the employer either to receive withholding exemption certificates, to make withholding computations, or to make payroll distributions. If an employer receives an invalid withholding exemption certificate, he shall consider it a nullity for purposes of computing withholding; he shall inform the employee who submitted the certificate that it is invalid, and shall request another withholding exemption certificate from the employee. If the employee who submitted the invalid certificate fails to comply with the employer's request, the employer shall withhold from the employee as from a single person claiming no exemptions (see § 31.3402 (f)(2)-1(a)); if, however, a prior certificate is in effect with respect to the employee, the employer shall continue to withhold in accordance with the prior certificate.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Applicability of withholding exemption certificate to qualified State individual income taxes.</E> The withholding exemption certificate shall be use for purposes of withholding with respect to qualified State individual income taxes as well as Federal tax. For provisions relating to the withholding exemption certificate with respect to such State taxes, see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulation on Procedure and Administration).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Submission of certain withholding exemption certificates and notice of the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted</E>—(1) <E T="03">Submission of certain withholding exemption certificates</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employer must submit to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a copy of any currently effective withholding exemption certificate as directed in a written notice to the employer from the IRS or as directed in published guidance.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Notice to submit withholding exemption certificates.</E> A notice to the employer to submit withholding exemption certificates may relate either to one or more named employees, to one or more reasonably segregable units of the employer, or to withholding exemption certificates under certain specified criteria. The notice will designate the IRS office where the copies of the withholding exemption certificates must be submitted. Alternatively, upon notice from the IRS, the employer must make available for inspection by an IRS employee withholding exemption certificates received from one or more named employees, from one or more reasonably segregable units of the employer, or from employees who have furnished withholding exemption certificates under certain specified criteria.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Published guidance.</E> Employers may also be required to submit copies of withholding exemption certificates under certain specified criteria when directed to do so by the IRS in published guidance. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term published guidance means a revenue procedure or <PRTPAGE P="218"/>notice published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Withholding after submission of withholding exemption certificate.</E> After a copy of a withholding exemption certificate has been submitted to the IRS under this paragraph (g)(1), the employer must withhold tax on the basis of the withholding exemption certificate, if the withholding exemption certificate meets the requirements of § 31.3402(f)(5)-1. However, the employer may not withhold on the basis of the withholding exemption certificate if the certificate must be disregarded based on a notice of the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted under the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted</E>—(i) <E T="03">Notice to employer.</E> The IRS may notify the employer in writing that the employee is not entitled to claim a complete exemption from withholding or more than the maximum number of withholding exemptions specified by the IRS in the written notice. The notice will also specify the applicable marital status for purposes of calculating the required amount of withholding. The notice will specify the IRS office to be contacted for further information. The notice of maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted may be issued if—</P>
              <P>(A) The IRS determines that a copy of a withholding exemption certificate submitted under paragraph (g)(1) of this section or otherwise provided to the IRS contains a materially incorrect statement or determines, after a request to the employee for verification of the statements on the certificate, that the IRS lacks sufficient information to determine if the certificate is correct.</P>
              <P>(B) The IRS otherwise determines that the employee is not entitled to claim a complete exemption from withholding and is not entitled to claim more than a specified number of withholding exemptions.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Notice to employee.</E> If the IRS provides a notice to the employer under this paragraph (g)(2), the IRS will also provide the employer with a similar notice for the employee (employee notice) that identifies the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted and specifies the marital status to be used for calculating the required amount of withholding. The employee notice will also indicate the process by which the employee can provide additional information to the IRS for purposes of determining the appropriate number of withholding exemptions and/or modifying the specified marital status. The IRS will also mail a similar notice to the employee's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2 of this chapter. If the IRS is unable to determine a last known address for the employee, the IRS will use other available information as appropriate to mail the notice to the employee.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requirement to furnish.</E> If the employee is employed by the employer as of the date of the notice, the employer must furnish the employee notice to the employee within 10 business days of receipt. The employer may follow any reasonable business practice to furnish the copy of the notice to the employee. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(iii), the determination of whether an employee is employed as of the date of the notice is based on all the facts and circumstances, including whether the employer has treated the employment relationship as terminated for other purposes. An employee that is not performing services for the employer as of the date of the notice is employed by the employer as of the date of the notice for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(iii) if—</P>
              <P>(A) The employer pays wages with respect to prior employment to the employee subject to income tax withholding on or after the date specified in the notice;</P>
              <P>(B) The employer reasonably expects the employee to resume the performance of services for the employer within twelve months of the date of the notice; or</P>

              <P>(C) The employee is on a bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed twelve months or the employee retains a right to reemployment with the employer under an applicable statute or by contract.<PRTPAGE P="219"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Requirement to notify the IRS.</E> If the employer is not required to furnish the notice to the employee under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the employer must send a written response to the IRS office designated in the notice indicating that the employee is not employed by the employer.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Requirement to withhold based on the notice.</E> If the employer is required to furnish the employee notice to the employee under paragraph (g)(2)(iii), then the employer must withhold tax on the basis of the maximum number of withholding exemptions and the marital status specified in the notice for any wages paid after the date specified in the notice, except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2)(vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), and (x) of this section. The employer must withhold tax in accordance with the notice as of the date specified in the notice, which shall be no earlier than 45 calendar days after the date of the notice.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Employment resumes after twelve months.</E> If the employer is required to furnish the employee notice to the employee only pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and the employee resumes the performance of services for the employer more than 12 months after the date of the notice, then the employer is not required to withhold based on the notice.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Requirement to withhold based on an existing Form W-4.</E> If a withholding exemption certificate is in effect with respect to the employee before the employer receives a notice of the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted under this paragraph (g)(2), the employer must continue to withhold tax in accordance with the existing withholding exemption certificate, rather than on the basis of the notice, if the existing withholding exemption certificate does not claim complete exemption from withholding and claims a marital status, a number of withholding exemptions, and any additional withholding that results in more withholding than would result from applying the marital status and number of withholding exemptions specified in the notice.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Modification notice.</E> After issuing the notice specifying the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted and the marital status, the IRS may issue a subsequent notice that modifies the original notice (modification notice). The modification notice may change the marital status and/or the number of withholding exemptions permitted. The employer must withhold based on the modification notice as of the date specified in the modification notice.</P>
              <P>(ix) <E T="03">Requirement to withhold after termination of employment.</E> If the employee is employed as of the date of the notice under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section but the employer or employee terminates the employment relationship after the date of the notice, the employer must continue to withhold based on the maximum number of withholding exemptions and the marital status specified in the notice or a modification notice if any wages subject to income tax withholding are paid with respect to the prior employment after such date. Furthermore, the employer must withhold based on the notice or modification notice if the employee resumes an employment relationship with the employer within 12 months after the termination of the employment relationship. Whether the employment relationship is terminated is based on all the facts and circumstances.</P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Requirement to withhold based on new Form W-4.</E> The employee may furnish a new withholding exemption certificate after the employer receives a notice or modification notice from the IRS of the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted under this paragraph (g)(2).</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Employee requests more withholding.</E> If the employee furnishes a new withholding exemption certificate after the employer receives the notice or modification notice, the employer must withhold tax on the basis of that new certificate only if the new certificate does not claim complete exemption from withholding and claims a marital status, a number of withholding exemptions, and any additional withholding that results in more withholding than would result under the notice or modification notice.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Employee requests less withholding.</E> If the employee furnishes a new withholding exemption certificate after the <PRTPAGE P="220"/>employer receives the notice or modification notice, the employer must disregard the new certificate and withhold on the basis of the notice or modification notice if the employee claims complete exemption from withholding or claims a marital status, a number of withholding exemptions, and any additional withholding that results in less withholding than would result under the notice or modification notice. If the employee wants to put a new certificate into effect that results in less withholding than that required under the notice or modification notice, the employee must contact the IRS. The employer must withhold on the basis of the notice or modification notice unless the IRS subsequently notifies the employer to withhold based on the new certificate.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Definition of employer.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term employer includes any person authorized by the employer to receive withholding exemption certificates, to make withholding computations, or to make payroll distributions.</P>

Employer Z receives a notice from the IRS in Year 1 that identifies the maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted and specifies the marital status for Employee F. Employer Z must furnish the employee notice to Employee F within 10 business days of receipt. Employer Z reasonably believes all the remuneration paid to Employee F in Year 1 is excluded from Employee F's gross income under section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code. Since section 3401(a)(8)(B) excludes such remuneration from wages for income tax withholding purposes, Employer X does not have to withhold on such remuneration, notwithstanding the maximum number of exemptions permitted and marital status specified in the notice. In Year 2, Employee F returns to the United States to perform <PRTPAGE P="221"/>services. Employer Z does not reasonably believe any part of Employee F's remuneration paid in Year 2 is excluded from Employee F's gross income under section 911. Rather, Employer Z reasonably believes that remuneration paid to Employee F in Year 2 is subject to income tax withholding.

A withholding exemption certificate must be prepared in accordance with the instructions and regulations applicable thereto, and must set forth fully and clearly the data that is called for therein. Blank copies of paper Forms W-4 will be supplied to employers upon request to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). An employer may also download and print Form W-4 from the IRS Internet site at <E T="03">www.irs.gov.</E> In lieu of the prescribed form, employers may prepare and use a form the provisions of which are identical with those of the prescribed form, but only if employers also provide employees with all the tables, instructions, and worksheets contained in the Form W-4 in effect at that time, and only if employers comply with all revenue procedures relating to substitute forms in effect at that time.</P>
              <P>(2) Employers are prohibited from accepting a substitute form developed by an employee, and the employee submitting such form will be treated as failing to furnish a withholding exemption certificate.

              <P>(1) An alteration of a withholding exemption certificate is any deletion of the language of the jurat or other similar provision of such certificate by which the employee certifies or affirms the correctness of the completed certificate, or any material defacing of such certificate;</P>

In addition, the design and operation of the electronic system, including access procedures, must make it reasonably certain that the person accessing the system and filing the Form W-4 is the employee identified in the form.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Same information as paper Form W-4.</E> The electronic filing must provide the employer with exactly the same information as the paper Form W-4.</P>

The electronic program must inform the employee that he or she must make the declaration contained in the jurat and that the declaration is made by signing the Form W-4. The instructions and the language of the jurat must immediately follow the employee's income tax withholding selections and immediately precede the employee's electronic signature.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Electronic signature.</E> The electronic signature must identify the employee filing the electronic Form W-4 and authenticate and verify the filing. For this purpose, the terms “authenticate” and “verify” have the same meanings as they do when applied to a written signature on a paper Form W-4. An electronic signature can be in any form that satisfies the foregoing requirements. The electronic signature must be the final entry in the employee's Form W-4 submission.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Copies of electronic Forms W-4.</E> Upon request by the Internal Revenue Service, the employer must supply a hardcopy of the electronic Form W-4 and a statement that, to the best of the employer's knowledge, the electronic Form W-4 was filed by the named employee. The hardcopy of the electronic Form W-4 must provide exactly the same information as, but need not be a facsimile of, the paper Form W-4.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Supplemental wage payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general and withholding on supplemental wages in excess of $1,000,000</E>—(1) <E T="03">Determination of supplemental wages and regular wages</E>—(i) <E T="03">Supplemental wages.</E> An employee's remuneration may consist of regular wages and supplemental wages. Supplemental wages are all wages paid by an employer that are not regular wages. Supplemental wages include wage payments made without regard to an employee's payroll period, but also may include payments made for a payroll period. Examples of wage payments that are included in supplemental wages include reported tips (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section), overtime pay (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section), bonuses, back pay, commissions, wages paid under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements, nonqualified deferred compensation includible in wages, wages paid as noncash fringe benefits, sick pay paid by a third party as an agent of the employer, amounts that are includible in gross income under section 409A, income recognized on the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, wages from imputed income for health coverage for a non-<PRTPAGE P="225"/>dependent, and wage income recognized on the lapse of a restriction on restricted property transferred from an employer to an employee. Amounts that are described as supplemental wages in this definition are supplemental wages regardless of whether the employer has paid the employee any regular wages during either the calendar year of the payment or any prior calendar year. Thus, for example, if the only wages that an employer has ever paid an employee are payments of noncash fringe benefits and income recognized on the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, such payments are classified as supplemental wages.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Regular wages.</E> As distinguished from supplemental wages, regular wages are amounts that are paid at a regular hourly, daily, or similar periodic rate (and not an overtime rate) for the current payroll period or at a predetermined fixed determinable amount for the current payroll period. Thus, among other things, wages that vary from payroll period to payroll period (such as commissions, reported tips, bonuses, or overtime pay) are not regular wages, except that an employer may treat tips as regular wages under paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section and an employer may treat overtime pay as regular wages under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Amounts that are not wages subject to income tax withholding.</E> If an amount of remuneration is not wages subject to income tax withholding, it is neither regular wages nor supplemental wages. Thus, for example, income from the disqualifying dispositions of shares of stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of statutory stock options, as described in section 421(b), is not included in regular wages or supplemental wages.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Optional treatment of overtime pay as regular wages.</E> Employers may treat overtime pay as regular wages rather than supplemental wages. For this purpose, <E T="03">overtime pay</E> is defined as any pay required to be paid pursuant to federal (Fair Labor Standards Act), state, or local governmental laws at a rate higher than the normal wage rate of the employee because the employee has worked hours in excess of the number of hours deemed to constitute a normal work week or work day.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Optional treatment of tips as regular wages.</E> Employers may treat tips as regular wages rather than supplemental wages. For this purpose, tips are defined as including all tips which are reported to the employer pursuant to section 6053.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Amount to be withheld.</E> The calculation of the amount of the income tax withholding with respect to supplemental wage payments is provided for under paragraph (a)(2) through (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Mandatory flat rate withholding.</E> If a supplemental wage payment, when added to all supplemental wage payments previously made by one employer (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) to an employee during the calendar year, exceeds $1,000,000, the rate used in determining the amount of withholding on the excess (including any excess which is a portion of a supplemental wage payment) shall be equal to the highest rate of tax applicable under section 1 for such taxable years beginning in such calendar year. This flat rate shall be applied without regard to whether income tax has been withheld from the employee's regular wages, without allowance for the number of withholding allowances claimed by the employee on Form W-4, “Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate,” without regard to whether the employee has claimed exempt status on Form W-4, without regard to whether the employee has requested additional withholding on Form W-4, and without regard to the withholding method used by the employer. Withholding under this paragraph (a)(2) is mandatory flat rate withholding.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Certain persons treated as one employer</E>—(i) <E T="03">Persons under common control.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all persons treated as a single employer under subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 shall be treated as one employer.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Agents.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any payment made to an employee by a third party acting as an agent for the employer (regardless of whether such person shall have been designated as an agent <PRTPAGE P="226"/>pursuant to section 3504) shall be considered as made by the employer except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Treatment of certain items in determining applicability of mandatory flat rate withholding</E>—(i) <E T="03">Optional treatment of compensation not subject to income tax withholding.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, employers may determine whether an employee has received $1,000,000 of supplemental wages during a calendar year by including in supplemental wages amounts includible in income but not subject to withholding that are reported as wages, tips, other compensation on Form W-2.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Allocation of salary reduction deferrals.</E> In allocating salary reduction deferral amounts excludable from wages for purposes of determining whether the employer has paid $1,000,000 of supplemental wages under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, employers must allocate such salary reduction deferral amounts to the type of compensation (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, gross amounts of regular wage payments or gross amounts of supplemental wage payments) actually being deferred.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Optional de minimis exception for certain payments by agents.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if an agent makes total wage payments (including regular wages and supplemental wages) of less than $100,000 to an individual during any calendar year, an employer or other agent may disregard such payments in determining whether the individual has received $1,000,000 of supplemental wages during the calendar year, and such agent need not consider whether the individual has received other supplemental wages in determining the amount of income tax to be withheld from the payments. An employer may not avail itself of this exception if the employer is making payments to the employee using five or more agents and a principal effect of such use of agents is to reduce the applicability of mandatory flat rate withholding to the employee. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if an agent makes total wage payments of $100,000 or more to an individual during any calendar year, the entire amount of supplemental wages paid by the agent during the calendar year to the employee must be taken into account (by other agents of the employer that make total wage payments to the employee of $100,000 or more, by the agent, and by the employer for which the agent is acting) in determining whether the employee has received $1,000,000 of supplemental wages.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Treatment of supplemental wage payment exceeding $1,000,000 cumulative threshold.</E> In the case of a supplemental wage payment that, when added to all supplemental wage payments previously made by the employer to the employee in the calendar year, results in the employee having received in excess of $1,000,000 supplemental wages for the calendar year, the employer is required to impose withholding under paragraph (a)(2) of this section only on the portion of the payment that is in excess of $1,000,000 (taking into account all prior supplemental wage payments during the year). However, an employer may subject the entire amount of such supplemental wage payment to the withholding imposed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Withholding on supplemental wages that are not subject to mandatory flat rate withholding.</E> To the extent that paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to a supplemental wage payment (or a portion of a payment), the amount of the tax required to be withheld on the supplemental wages when paid shall be determined under the rules provided in paragraphs (a)(6) and (7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Aggregate procedure for withholding on supplemental wages</E>—(i) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The employer is required to determine withholding upon supplemental wages under this paragraph (a)(6) if paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to the payment or portion of the payment and if paragraph (a)(7) of this section may not be used with respect to the payment. In addition, employers have the option of using this paragraph (a)(6) to calculate withholding with respect to a supplemental wage payment, if paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to the payment, but if paragraph (a)(7) of this section could be used with respect to the payment.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Provided this procedure applies under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of <PRTPAGE P="227"/>this section, the supplemental wages, if paid concurrently with wages for a payroll period, are aggregated with the wages paid for such payroll period. If not paid concurrently, the supplemental wages are aggregated with the wages paid or to be paid within the same calendar year for the last preceding payroll period or for the current payroll period, if any. The amount of tax to be withheld is determined as if the aggregate of the supplemental wages and the regular wages constituted a single wage payment for the regular payroll period. The withholding method used by the employer with respect to regular wages would then be used to calculate the withholding on this single wage payment and the employer would take into consideration the Form W-4 submitted by the employee. This procedure is the aggregate procedure for withholding on supplemental wages.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Optional flat rate withholding on supplemental wages</E>—(i) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The employer may determine withholding upon supplemental wages under this paragraph (a)(7) if three conditions are met—</P>
              <P>(A) Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to the payment or the portion of the payment;</P>
              <P>(B) The supplemental wages are either not paid concurrently with regular wages or are separately stated on the payroll records of the employer; and</P>
              <P>(C) Income tax has been withheld from regular wages of the employee during the calendar year of the payment or the preceding calendar year.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> The determination of the tax to be withheld under paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section is made without reference to any payment of regular wages, without allowance for the number of withholding allowances claimed by the employee on Form W-4, and without regard to whether the employee has requested additional withholding on Form W-4. Withholding under this procedure is optional flat rate withholding.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Rate applicable for purposes of optional flat rate withholding.</E> Provided the conditions of paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section have been met, the employer may determine the tax to be withheld—</P>
              <P>(A) From supplemental wages paid after April 30, 1966, and prior to January 1, 1994, by using a flat percentage rate of 20 percent;</P>
              <P>(B) From supplemental wages paid after December 31, 1993, and on or before August 6, 2001, by using a flat percentage rate of 28 percent;</P>
              <P>(C) From supplemental wages paid after August 6, 2001, and on or before December 31, 2001, by using a flat percentage rate of 27.5 percent;</P>
              <P>(D) From supplemental wages paid after December 31, 2001, and on or before May 27, 2003, by using a flat percentage rate of 27 percent;</P>
              <P>(E) From supplemental wages paid after May 27, 2003, and on or before December 31, 2004, by using a flat percentage rate of 25 percent; and</P>
              <P>(F) From supplemental wages paid after December 31, 2004, by using a flat percentage rate of 28 percent (or the corresponding rate in effect under section 1(i)(2) for taxable years beginning in the calendar year in which the payment is made).</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Examples.</E> For purposes of these examples, it is assumed that the rate for purposes of mandatory flat rate withholding for 2007 is 35 percent, and the rate for purposes of optional flat rate withholding for 2007 is 25 percent. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (a):
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>(i) Employee A is an employee of three entities (X, Y, and Z) that are treated as a single employer under section 52(a) or (b). In 2007, X pays regular wages to A on a monthly payroll period for services performed for X, Y, and Z. The regular wages are paid on the third business day of each month. Income tax is withheld from the regular wages of A during the year. A receives only the following supplemental wage payments during 2007 in addition to the regular wages paid by X—</P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(A) A bonus of $600,000 from X on March 15, 2007;</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(B) A bonus of $2,300,000 from Y on November 15, 2007; and</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(C) A bonus of $10,000 from Z on December 31, 2007.</FP>
                <P>(ii) In this <E T="03">Example 1</E>, the $600,000 bonus from X is a supplemental wage payment. The withholding on the $600,000 payment from X could be determined under either paragraph (a)(6) or (7) of this section because income tax has been withheld from the regular wages of A. If X elects to use the aggregate <PRTPAGE P="228"/>procedure under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the amount of withholding on the supplemental wages would be based on aggregating the supplemental wages and the regular wages paid by X either for the current or last payroll period and treating the total of the regular wages paid by X and the $600,000 supplemental wages as a single wage payment for a regular payroll period. The withholding method used by the employer with respect to regular wages would then be used to calculate the withholding on this single wage payment, and the employer would take into consideration the Form W-4 furnished by the employee.</P>
                <P>(iii) In this <E T="03">Example 1</E>, the $2,300,000 bonus from Y is a supplemental wage payment. To calculate the withholding on the $2,300,000 supplemental wage payment from Y, the $600,000 of supplemental wages X has already paid to A in 2007 must be taken into account because X and Y are treated as the same employer under section 52(a) or (b). Thus, the withholding on the first $400,000 of the payment (i.e., the cumulative supplemental wages not in excess of $1,000,000) is computed separately from the withholding on the remaining $1,900,000 of the payment (i.e., the amount of the cumulative supplemental wages in excess of $1,000,000). With respect to the first $400,000, the withholding could be computed under either paragraph (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, because income tax has been withheld from the regular wages of the employee. If Y elected to withhold income tax using paragraph (a)(7) of this section, Y would withhold on the $400,000 component at 25 percent (pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(iii)(F) of this section), which would result in $100,000 tax withheld. The remaining $1,900,000 of the bonus would be subject to mandatory flat rate withholding at the maximum rate of tax in effect under section 1 for 2007 (35%) without regard to the Form W-4 submitted by A. The amount withheld from the $1,900,000 would be $665,000. The withholding on the first component and the withholding on the second component then would be added together to determine the total income tax withholding on the supplemental wage payment from Y. Alternatively, under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, Y could treat the entire $2,300,000 bonus payment as subject to mandatory flat rate withholding at the maximum rate of tax (35%), in which case the amount to be withheld would be 35 percent of $2,300,000, or $805,000.</P>
                <P>(iv) The $10,000 bonus paid from Z is also a supplemental wage payment. To calculate the withholding on the $10,000 bonus, the $2,900,000 in cumulative supplemental wages already paid to A in 2007 by X and Y must be taken into account because X, Y, and Z are treated as a single employer. The entire $10,000 bonus would be subject to mandatory flat rate withholding at the maximum rate of tax in effect under section 1 for 2007. The income tax required to be withheld on this payment would be 35 percent of $10,000 or $3,500.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>Employees B and C work for employer M. Each employee receives a monthly salary of $3,000 in 2007. As a result of the withholding allowances claimed by B, there has been no income tax withholding on the regular wages M pays to B during either 2007 or 2006. In contrast, M has withheld income tax from regular wages M pays to C during 2007. Together with the monthly salary check paid in December 2007 to each employee, M includes a bonus of $2,000, which is the only supplemental wage payment each employee receives from M in 2007. The bonuses are separately stated on the payroll records of M. Because M has withheld no income tax from B's regular wages during either the calendar year of the $2,000 bonus or the preceding calendar year, M cannot use optional flat rate withholding provided under paragraph (a)(7) of this section to calculate the income tax withholding on B's $2,000 bonus. Consequently, M must use the aggregate procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(6) of this section to calculate the income tax withholding due on the $2,000 bonus to B. With respect to the bonus paid to C, M has the option of using either the aggregate procedure provided under paragraph (a)(6) of this section or the optional flat rate withholding provided under paragraph (a)(7) of this section to calculate the income tax withholding due.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>

                <P>(i) Employee D works as an employee of Corporation R. Corporations R and T are treated as a single employer under section 52(a) or (b). R makes regular wage payments to Employee D of $200,000 on a monthly basis in 2007, and income tax is withheld from those wages. R pays D a bonus for his services as an employee equal to $3,000,000 on June 30, 2007. Unrelated company U pays D sick pay as an agent of the employer R and such sick pay is supplemental wages pursuant to § 31.3401(a)-1(b)(8)(i)(<E T="03">b</E>)(<E T="03">2</E>). U pays D $50,000 of sick pay on October 31, 2007. Corporation T decides to award bonuses to all employees of R and T, and pays a bonus of $100,000 to D on December 31, 2007. D received no other payments from R, T, or U.</P>
                <P>(ii) In chronological summary, D is paid the following wages other than the regular monthly wages paid by R:</P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(A) June 30, 2007—$3,000,000 (bonus from R);</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(B) October 31, 2007—$50,000 (sick pay from U); and</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(C) December 31, 2007—$100,000 (bonus from T).</FP>
                <P>(iii) In this <E T="03">Example 3</E>, each payment of wages other than the regular monthly wage payments from R is considered to be supplemental wages for purposes of withholding <PRTPAGE P="229"/>under § 31.3402(g)-1(a)(2). The amount of regular wages from R is irrelevant in determining when mandatory flat rate withholding on supplemental wages must be applied.</P>
                <P>(iv) Because income tax has been withheld on D's regular wages, income tax may be withheld on $1,000,000 of the $3,000,000 bonus paid on June 30, 2007, under either paragraph (a)(6) or (7) of this section. If R elects to use optional flat rate withholding provided under paragraph (a)(7)(iii)(F) of this section, withholding would be calculated at 25 percent of the $1,000,000 portion of the payment and would be $250,000.</P>
                <P>(v) Income tax withheld on the following supplemental wage payments (or portion of a payment) as follows is required to be calculated at the maximum rate in effect under section 1, or 35 percent in 2007—</P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(A) $2,000,000 of the $3,000,000 bonus paid by R on June 30, 2007; and</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(B) all of the $100,000 bonus paid by T on December 31, 2007.</FP>
                <P>(vi) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, because the total wage payments made by U, an agent of the employer, to D are less than $100,000, U is permitted to determine the amount of income tax to be withheld without regard to other supplemental wage payments made to the employee. Income tax withholding on the $50,000 in sick pay may be determined under either paragraph (a)(6) or (7) of this section. If U elects to withhold income tax at the flat rate provided under paragraph (a)(7)(iii)(F) of this section, withholding on the $50,000 of sick pay would be calculated at 25 percent of the $50,000 payment and would be $12,500. Alternatively, U may choose to take account of the $3,000,000 in supplemental wages paid by the employer during 2007 prior to payment of the $50,000 sick pay, and withholding on the $50,000 of sick pay could be calculated applying the mandatory flat rate of 35 percent, resulting in withholding of $17,500 on the $50,000 payment.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4.</HD>
                <P>(i) Employer J has decided it wants to grant its employee B a $1,000,000 net bonus (after withholding) to be paid in 2007. Employer J has withheld income tax from the regular wages of the employee. Employer J has made no other supplemental wage payments to B during the year.</P>
                <P>(ii) This <E T="03">Example 4</E> requires grossing up the supplemental wage payment to determine the gross wages necessary to result in a net payment of $1,000,000. If the employer elected to use optional flat rate withholding, the first $1,000,000 of the wages would be subject to 25 percent withholding. However, any wages above that, including amounts representing gross-up payments, would be subject to mandatory 35 percent withholding. The withholding applicable to the first $1,000,000 (i.e., $250,000) would thus be required to be grossed-up at a 35 percent rate to determine the gross wage amount in excess of $1,000,000. Thus, the wages in excess of $1,000,000 would be equal to $250,000 divided by .65 (computed by subtracting .35 from 1) or $384,615.38. Thus the total supplemental wage payment, taking into account income tax withholding only (and not Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes), to B would be $1,384,615.38, and the total withholding with respect to the payment if Employer J elected optional flat rate withholding with respect to the first $1,000,000, would be $384,615.38.</P>

Company X pays 45 percent, Company Y pays 35 percent and Company Z pays 20 percent of such expenses. The amount of tax required to be withheld on the wages paid to persons employed in the central agency should be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. In such event, Company X is liable as an employer for the return and payment of 45 percent of the tax required to be withheld, Company Y is liable for the return and payment of 35 percent of the tax and Company Z is liable for the return and payment of 20 percent of the tax.

If an adjustment is required, the additional tax required to be withheld may be deducted upon any payment of wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer during the quarter and within the first 30 days following the quarter or from funds turned over by the employee to the employer for such purpose within such period.

                <P>On July 1, 1970, A, a single person who is on a weekly payroll period and claims one exemption, receives wages of $100 from X Co., his employer. X Co. multiplies the weekly wage of $100 by 52 weeks to determine an annual wage of $5,200. It then subtracts $650 for A's withholding exemption and arrives at a balance of $4,550. The applicable table in section 3402(a) for annual payroll periods indicates that the amount of tax to be withheld thereon is $376 plus $314.50 (17 percent of excess over $2,700), or a total of $690.50. The annual tax of $690.50, when divided by 52 to arrive at the portion thereof attributable to the weekly payroll period, equals $13.28. X Co. may, if it chooses, withhold $13.28 rather than the amount specified in section 3402 (a) or (c) for a weekly payroll period.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Combined FICA and income tax withholding.</E> In addition to the methods authorized by paragraph (a) of this section, an employer may determine the <PRTPAGE P="234"/>amount of tax to be deducted and withheld under section 3402 upon a payment of wages to an employee by using tables prescribed by the Commissioner which combine the amounts of tax to be deducted under sections 3102 and 3402. Such tables shall provide for the deduction of the sum of such amounts, computed on the basis of the midpoints of the wage brackets in the tables prescribed under section 3402(c). The portion of such sum which is to be treated as the tax deducted and withheld under section 3402 shall be the amount obtained by subtracting from such sum the amount of tax required to be deducted by section 3102. Such tables may be used only with respect to payments which are wages under both sections 3121(a) and 3401(a).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Part-year employment method of withholding</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> In addition to the methods authorized by other paragraphs of this section, in the case of part-year employment (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) of an employee who determines his liability for tax under subtitle A of the Code on a calendar-year basis and who has in effect a request that the amount of tax to be withheld from his wages be computed according to the part-year employment method described in this paragraph, the employer may determine the amount of tax to be deducted and withheld upon a payment of wages made to the employee on or after January 5, 1973, by taking the following steps:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Add the amount of wages to be paid to the employee for the current payroll period to the total amount of wages paid by the employer to the employee for all preceding payroll periods included in the current term of continuous employment (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) of the employee by the employer;</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Divide the aggregate amount of wages computed in Step 1 by the total of the number of payroll periods to which that amount relates plus the equivalent number of payroll periods (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) in the employee's term of continuous unemployment immediately preceding the current term of continuous employment, such term of continuous unemployment to be exclusive of any days prior to the beginning of the current calendar year;</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Step 3.</E> Determine the total amount of tax that would have been required to be deducted and withheld under section 3402 if the average amount of wages (as computed in Step 2) had been paid to the employee for the number of payroll periods determined in Step 2 (including the equivalent number of payroll periods); and</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Step 4.</E> Determine the excess, if any, of the amount of tax computed in Step 3 over the total amount of tax already deducted and withheld by the employer from wages paid to the employee for all payroll periods during the current term of continuous employment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <FP>The use of the method described in this paragraph does not preclude the employee from claiming additional withholding allowances pursuant to section 3402(m) or the standard deduction allowance pursuant to section 3402(f)(1)(G).</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Equivalent number of payroll periods.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, the equivalent number of payroll periods shall be determined by dividing the number of calendar days contained in the current payroll period into the number of calendar days between the later of (i) the day certified by the employee as his last day of employment prior to his current term of continuous employment during the calendar year in which such term commenced, or (ii) the last day of the calendar year immediately preceding the current calendar year, and the first day of the current term of continuous employment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “calendar days” includes holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays. In determining the equivalent number of payroll periods, any fraction obtained in the division described in the first sentence of this subparagraph shall be disregarded. An employee paid for a miscellaneous payroll period shall be considered to have a daily payroll period for purposes of this subparagraph. In a case in which an employee is paid for a daily or miscellaneous payroll period and the employer elects under Circular E to compute the tax to be withheld as if the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week were paid for a weekly period, the employer shall determine the equivalent number of payroll periods for purposes of the computation of the tax to be withheld for the calendar week on the basis of a weekly payroll period (notwithstanding the fact that a <PRTPAGE P="235"/>determination of the equivalent number of payroll periods for purposes of the computation of the tax to be withheld upon wages paid for daily or miscellaneous payroll periods within such calendar week has been made on the basis of a daily or miscellaneous payroll period).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Term of continuous employment.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, a term of employment is continuous if it is either a single term of employment or two or more consecutive terms of employment with the same employer. A term of continuous employment begins on the first day on which any services are performed by the employee for the employer for which compensation is paid or payable. Such term ends on the earlier of (i) the last day during the current term of continuous employment on which any services are performed by the employee for the employer, or (ii) if the employee performs no services for the employer for a period of more than 30 calendar days, the last day preceding such period on which any services are performed by the employee for the employer. For example, a professional athlete who signs a contract on December 31, 1973, to perform services from July 1 through December 31 for the calendar years 1974, 1975, and 1976 has a new term of employment beginning each July 1 and accordingly may qualify for use of the part-year withholding method in each of such years. Likewise, a term of continuous employment is not broken by a temporary layoff of no more than 30 days. On the other hand, when an employment relationship is actually terminated the term of continuous employment is ended even though a new employment relationship is established with the same employer within 30 days. A “term of continuous employment” includes all days on which an employee performs any services for an employer and includes days on which services are not performed because of illness or vacation, or because such days are holidays or are regular days off (such as Saturdays and Sundays, or days off in lieu of Saturdays and Sundays), or other days for which the employee is not scheduled to work. For example, an employee who is employed 2 days a week for the same employer from March 1 through December 31 has a term of continuous employment of 306 days.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Part-year employment.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, “part-year employment” means one or more terms of continuous employment with all employers which term or terms will not aggregate more than 245 days within a calendar year. For example, A graduates from college in May and was not employed from January through May. A accepts a permanent position with X Co., beginning June 1. Since the total duration of A's term of continuous employment will, during the current calendar year, not exceed 245 days it does qualify as part-year employment for purposes of this section.</P>
              <FP>If, however, A had also worked for Y Co. from December 15 of the previous year through February 5 of the current calendar year, the total duration of A's terms of continuous employment will, during the current calendar year, exceed 245 days (36 days (January 1 through February 5) plus 214 days (June 1 through December 31) equals 250 days). This year's employment does not therefore qualify as part-year employment for purposes of this section.</FP>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Employee's request.</E> (i) An employee's request that his employer withhold according to the part-year employment method shall be in writing and in such form as the employer may prescribe. Such request shall be made under the penalties of perjury and shall contain the following information—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The last day of employment (if any) by any employer prior to the current term of continuous employment during the calendar year in which such term commenced.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) A statement that the employee reasonably anticipates that he will be employed for an aggregate of no more than 245 days in all terms of continuous employment during the current calendar year, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) The employee uses a calendar-year accounting period.
              </P>

              <FP>An employee's request furnished to his employer pursuant to this section shall be effective, and may be acted upon by his employer, with respect to wages paid after the furnishing of such request, and shall cease to be effective with respect to any wages paid on or <PRTPAGE P="236"/>after the beginning of the payroll period during which the current calendar year will end.</FP>

              <P>(ii) If, on any day during the calendar year, any of the anticipations stated by the employee in his statement provided pursuant to subdivision (i)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this subparagraph becomes unreasonable, the employee shall revoke the request described in this subparagraph before the end of the payroll period during which it becomes unreasonable. The revocation shall be effective as of the beginning of the payroll period during which it is made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Remuneration other than in cash for service performed by retail commission salesman.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) An employer, in computing the amount to be deducted and withheld as tax in accordance with section 3402, may, at his election, disregard any wages paid, after August 9, 1955, in a medium other than cash for services performed for him by an employee if (i) the noncash remuneration is paid for services performed by the employee as a retail commission salesman and (ii) the employer ordinarily pays the employee remuneration solely by way of cash commissions for services performed by him as a retail commission salesman.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 3402(j) and this section are not applicable with respect to wages paid to the employee that are subject to withholding under § 31.3402(g)-1(a)(2). Section 3402(j) and this section are not applicable with respect to noncash wages paid to a retail commission salesman for services performed by him in a capacity other than as such a salesman. Such sections are not applicable with respect to noncash wages paid by an employer to an employee for services performed as a retail commission salesman if the employer ordinarily pays the employee remuneration other than by way of cash commissions for such services. Thus, noncash remuneration may not be disregarded in computing the amount to be deducted and withheld in a case where the employee, for services performed as a retail commission salesman, is paid both a salary and cash commissions on sales, or is ordinarily paid in something other than cash (stocks, bonds, or other forms of property) notwithstanding that the amount of remuneration paid to the employee is measured by sales.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Retail commission salesman.</E> For purposes of section 3402(j) and this section, the term “retail commission salesman” includes an employee who is engaged in the solicitation of orders at retail, that is, from the ultimate consumer, for merchandise or other products offered for sale by his employer. The term does not include an employee salesman engaged in the solicitation on behalf of his employer of orders from wholesalers, retailers, or others, for merchandise for resale. However, if the salesman solicits orders for more than one principal, he is not excluded from the term solely because he solicits orders from wholesalers or retailers on behalf of one or more principals. In such case the salesman may be a retail commission salesman with respect to services performed for one or more principals and not with respect to services performed for his other principals.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Noncash remuneration.</E> The term “noncash remuneration” includes remuneration paid in any medium other than cash, such as goods or commodities, stocks, bonds, or other forms of property. The term does not include checks or other monetary media of exchange.</P>

(For provisions relating to the treatment of tips as wages, see §§ 3401(a)(16) and 3401(f).) The employer shall make the withholding by deducting or causing to be deducted the amount of the tax from wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the <PRTPAGE P="238"/>control of the employer or other funds turned over by the employee to the employer (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section). For purposes of this section the terms “wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer” means, with respect to a payment of wages, an amount equal to wages as defined in section 3401(a) except that tips and noncash remuneration which are wages are not included, less the sum of—</P>
              <P>(i) The tax under section 3101 required to be collected by the employer in respect of wages as defined in section 3121(a) (exclusive of tips);</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> An employer is required to deduct and withhold the tax on tips which constitute wages only in respect of those tips which are reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a). The employer is responsible for the collection of the tax on tips reported to him only to the extent that the emloyer can, during the period beginning at the time the written statement is submitted to him and ending at the close of the calendar year in which the statement was submitted, collect the tax by deducting it or causing it to be deducted as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Furnishing of funds to employer.</E> If the amount of the tax in respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) exceeds the wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer from which the employer is required to withhold the tax in respect of such tips, the employee may furnish to the employer, within the period specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an amount of money equal to the amount of such excess.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Less than $20 of tips.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if an employee furnishes to his employer a written statement—</P>
              <P>(1) Covering a period of less than 1 month, and</P>
              <P>(2) The statement is furnished to the employer prior to the close of the 10th day of the month following the month in which the tips were actually received by the employee, and</P>
              <P>(3) The aggregate amount of tips reported in the statement and in all other statements previously furnished by the employee covering periods within the same month is less than $20, and such statements, collectively, do not cover the entire month,</P>
              <FP>the employer may deduct amounts equivalent to the tax on such tips from wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer or other funds turned over by the employee to the employer. For provisions relating to the repayment to an employee, or other disposition, of amounts deducted from an employee's remuneration in excess of the correct amount of tax, see § 31.6413(a)-1. (As to the exclusion from wages of tips of less than $20, see § 31.3401(a)(16)-1.)</FP>

                <FP>W does not turn over any funds to R. R should satisfy the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3402 out of W's $40 wage as follows: The taxes imposed with respect to the regular wage (a total of $74l) should be satisfied first. The taxes imposed with respect to tips are to be withheld only out of “wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer” as that phrase is defined in §§ 31.3102-3(a)(1) and 31.3402(k)-1(a)(1). The amount of such wages under the control of employer in this example is $31.39, or $40, less the amounts applied in satisfaction of the Federal and State withholding taxes imposed with respect to the regular $40 wage ($8.61). This $31.39 is applied first in satisfaction of the tax under section 3101 with respect to tips ($7.04) in the balance of $24.35 is applied in partial satisfaction of the withholding of income tax at source under section 3402 with respect to tips. The amount of the tax with respect to tips under section 3402 which remains unsatisfied ($3.95) should be withheld from wages under the control of the employer the following week.</FP>

              <P>(ii) If an employee who has in effect a withholding exemption certificate indicating that he is a married person, is considered married solely because of the application of subparagraph (2)(ii) of paragraph (c) of this section, and his spouse died during the taxable year which precedes by 2 years the current taxable year, the employee must, on or before December 1 of the current taxable year, furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate indicating that he is a single person. Such certificate shall not, however become effective until the next calendar year (see paragraph (c) of § 31.3402(f)(3)-1).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> An employee may claim, with respect to wages paid after <PRTPAGE P="241"/>December 31, 1981, a number of withholding allowances determined in accordance with this section. In order to receive the benefit of such allowances, the employee must have in effect with his employer a withholding exemption certificate claiming such allowances.</P>

              <P>(ii) For the credit for tax withheld at source on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and on tax-free covenant bonds under section 32,</P>
              <P>(iii) That the employee may claim the credit for certain uses of gasoline and special fuels under section 39 only to the extent the employee has not filed for a quarterly tax refund of the credit on Form 843,</P>
              <P>(iv) That the employee may claim the credit for earned income under section 43 only to the extent the employee has not filed for advance payments of the credit on Form W-5, and</P>
              <P>(v) For the credit for overpayment of tax under section 45,</P>
              <P>(3) The estimated trade and business deductions of employees described in section 62 (2) and allowed by Part VI of Subchapter B of Chapter 1,</P>
              <P>(4) The estimated deduction for payments to pension, profit-sharing, annuity, and bond purchase plans of self-employed individuals described in section 62(7) and allowed by section 404 and section 405(c),</P>
              <P>(5) The estimated deduction for penalties forfeited because of premature withdrawal of funds from time savings accounts or deposits described in section 62(12) and allowed by section 165,</P>

              <P>(7) The estimated deduction for net operating loss carryovers under section 172,</P>
              <P>(8) The estimated deduction for alimony, etc., payments under section 215,</P>
              <P>(9) The estimated deduction for moving expenses under section 217 but only to the extent that the amount of such deduction is not excluded from the definition of wages by section 3401(a)(15),</P>
              <P>(10) The estimated deduction for certain retirement savings under section 219 but only to the extent that the amount of such deduction is not excluded from the definition of wages by section 3401(a)(12)(D),</P>
              <P>(11) The estimated deduction for two-earner married couples under section 221,</P>
              <P>(12) The estimated net losses from schedules C (Profit or (Loss) From Business or Profession), D (Capital Gains and Losses), E (Supplemental Income Schedule), and F (Farm Income and Expenses) of Form 1040 and from the last line of Part II of Form 4797 (Supplemental Schedule of Gains and Losses),</P>
              <P>(13) The estimated amount of decrease of tax due attributable to income averaging under sections 1301 through 1305.</P>
              <FP>The employee must first use these items ((1) through (13) of this paragraph (b)) to eliminate any payment of estimated tax (as defined in section 6015(d)). Only amounts of these items remaining after the employee has done this may be taken into account in determining the number of withholding allowances the employee may claim.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Estimated.</E> The term “estimated” as used in this section to modify the terms “deduction”, “deductions”, “credits”, “losses”, and “amount of decrease” means with respect to an employee the aggregate dollar amount of a particular item that the employee reasonably expects will be allowable to him for the estimation year under the section of the Code specified for each item. In no event shall that amount exceed the sum of:</P>

              <P>(i) The amount shown for that particular item on the income tax return that the employee has filed for the taxable year preceding the estimation year (or, if such return has not yet been filed, then the income tax return that the employee filed for the taxable year preceding such year), which <PRTPAGE P="242"/>amount the employee also reasonably expects to show on the income tax return for the estimation year, plus</P>
              <P>(ii) The determinable additional amounts for each item for the estimation year.</P>
              <FP>The determinable additional amounts are amounts that are not included in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and that are demonstrably attributable to indentifiable events during the estimation year or the preceding year. Amounts are demonstrably attributable to identifiable events if they relate to payments already made during the estimation year, to binding obligations to make payments (including the payment of taxes) during the year, and to other transactions or occurrences, the implementation of which has begun and is verifiable at the time the employee files a withholding exemption certificate claiming withholding allowances relating thereto. The estimation year is the taxable year including the day on which the employee files the withholding exemption certificate with his employer, except that if the employee files the withholding exemption certificate with his employer and specifies on the certificate that the certificate is not to take effect until a specified future date, the estimation year shall be the taxable year including that specified future date. It is not reasonable for an employee to include in his or her withholding computation for the estimation year any amount that is shown for a particular item on the income tax return that the employee has filed for the taxable year preceding the estimation year (or, if such return has not yet been filed, then the income tax return that the employee filed for the taxable year preceding such year) and that has been disallowed by the Service as part of a proposed adjustment described in § 601.103(b) (relating to examination and determination of tax liability) and § 601.105(b) (relating to examination of returns).</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Amount of decrease of tax due.</E> The term “amount of decrease of tax due” as used in paragraph (b)(13) of this section means:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of tax that the taxpayer would owe on his taxable income without using Schedule G (Form 1040), minus</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of tax that the taxpayer would owe on his taxable income using Schedule G (Form 1040).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Itemized deductions.</E> The term “itemized deductions” as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section has the same meaning as ascribed thereto by section 63(f) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Computing allowances.</E> (1) The employee shall compute the number of allowances he may claim for the items specified in paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with the tables and instructions on Form W-4.</P>
              <P>(2) If the employee:</P>
              <P>(i) Pays or accrues amounts demonstrably attributable to identifiable events (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) that are:</P>
              <P>(A) Interest attributable to ownership of real property and deductible under section 163(a), or</P>
              <P>(B) Taxes deductible under section 164(a)(1), or</P>
              <P>(C) Interest or taxes deductible under section 216(a), and</P>
              <P>(ii) Is obligated to pay or accrue such amounts for at least 2 years subsequent to the estimation year,</P>
              <FP>then the employee may compute the portion of estimated itemized deductions attributable to such amounts for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section by multiplying the total of such amounts to be paid or accrued in the estimation year by 12 and by then dividing that result by the number of months from the 1st month in the estimation year in which the employee pays or accrues such amounts through the last month of the estimation year. If such amounts decrease during the term of obligation, the employee must, at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year, recompute the number of allowances being claimed as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the employee uses the computation described in this subparagraph (2), the employee may not request that his employer withhold on the basis of the employee's cumulative wages as provided in § 31.3402 (h)(3)-1.</FP>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>

                <P>Employee A, an unmarried, calendar-year basis taxpayer, files his income tax return for 2005 on April 10, 2006. A has adjusted gross income of $5,000 and is not liable for any income tax. He had $180 of income tax withheld during 2005. A anticipates that <PRTPAGE P="244"/>his gross income for 2006 will be approximately the same amount, and that he will not incur income tax liability for that year. On April 20, 2006, A commences employment and furnishes his employer a withholding exemption certificate certifying that he incurred no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for 2005, and that he anticipates that he will incur no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for 2006. A's employer shall not deduct and withhold on payments of wages made to A on or after April 20, 2006. Under § 31.3402(f)(4)-2(c), unless A furnishes a new withholding exemption certificate certifying the statements described in paragraph (a) of this section to his employer, his employer is required to deduct and withhold upon payments of wages to A made after February 15, 2007.</P>

                <P>Assume the facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 1</E> except that A had been employed by his employer prior to April 20, 2006, and had furnished his employer a withholding exemption certificate prior to furnishing the withholding exemption certificate certifying the statements described in paragraph (a) of this section on April 20, 2006. Under section 3402(f)(3)(B)(i), his employer would be required to give effect to the new withholding exemption certificate no later than the beginning of the first payroll period ending (or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period) on or after May 20, 2006. However, under section 3402(f)(3)(B)(ii), his employer could, if it chose, make the new withholding exemption certificate effective with respect to any payment of wages made on or after April 20, 2006, and before the effective date mandated by section 3402(f)(3)(B)(i). Under § 31.3402(f)(4)-2(c), unless A furnishes a new withholding exemption certificate certifying the statements described in § 31.3402(n)-1(a) to his employer, his employer is required to deduct and withhold upon payments of wages to A made after February 15, 2007.</P>

Also, periodic payments to an individual who is retired before the normal retirement age for reasons of disability, to which the provisions of section 105(d) apply, shall be deemed to be an annuity for purposes of this section. A lump-sum payment (including a total distribution under section 72(n)) is not an annuity.</P>
              <P>(2) The term “payee” means an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States and who receives an annuity payment.</P>
              <P>(3) The term “payor” means a person making an annuity payment except that, if the person making the payment is acting soley as an agent for another person, the term “payor” shall mean such other person and not the person actually making the payment. For example, if a bank makes an annuity payment only as agent for an employees' trust, the trust shall be deemed to be the “payor.” Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any person who, under section 3401(a) (5) or (8), would not be required to deduct and withhold the tax under section 3402 if the annuity payment were remuneration for services shall not be considered a “payor.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>Extension of withholding to sick pay.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Under section 3402(o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and this section, the payee (as defined in <PRTPAGE P="247"/>paragraph (h)(2) of this section) of sick pay (as defined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section) may request the payor (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) of the sick pay to withhold income tax with respect to payments of sick pay made on or after May 1, 1981. If such a request is made, the payor must deduct and withhold as requested.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Manner of making request.</E> A payee who wishes a payor to deduct and withhold income tax from sick pay shall file a written request with the payor to deduct and withhold a specific whole dollar amount (subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section) from each sick pay payment. The request shall be made on Form W-4S in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto, and shall set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. In lieu of Form W-4S, payors may prepare and use a form the provisions of which are identical to those of Form W-4S. The payee must include his social security account number in the request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amount requested to be withheld.</E> The payee shall request that the payor withhold a specific whole dollar amount. The specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $20 per weekly payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay computed on a daily basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $4 per daily payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a biweekly basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $40 per 2 week payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a semimonthly basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $44 per semimonthly payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a monthly basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $88 per monthly payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a basis other than weekly, daily, biweekly, semi-monthly, or monthly, the specific whole dollar amount shall be the equivalent of at least $4 per day, assuming a 5 day work week of 8 hours per day (40 hours total) in each 7 day calendar week. In the case of a payment which is greater or less than a full payment, the amount withheld is to bear the same relation to the specific whole dollar amount requested to be withheld as such payment bears to a full payment. For example, assume an individual receives sick pay of $100 per week and requests that $25 per week be withheld for taxes. After 4 full weeks of absence, the individual returns to work on a Wednesday (having been absent on sick leave Monday and Tuesday). For the week the individual returns to work, the individual would be entitled to $40 of sick pay, $10 of which would be withheld for taxes. The payor may, at his option, permit the payee to request that the payor withhold a specific percentage from each payment. The specific percentage shall be at least 10 percent. If the payor so opts, the payor must also accept requests under the whole dollar method. If the amount requested to be withheld under either the whole dollar method or the optional percentage method reduces the net amount of a sick pay payment received by the payee to below $10, no income tax shall be withheld from that payment by the payor.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">When request takes effect.</E> The payor must deduct and withhold the amount specified in the request with respect to payments made more than 7 days after the date on which the request is received by the payor. At the election of the payor, the request may take effect before this deadline.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Duration and termination of request.</E> A request under this section shall continue in effect until changed or terminated. The payee may change the request by filing a new written request that meets all of the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The new request shall take effect as specified in paragraph (d) of this section and the old request shall be deemed terminated when the new request takes effect. The payee may terminate the request by furnishing the payor a signed written notice of termination containing both a request to terminate withholding and all the information contained in the request to withhold. This written notice of termination shall take effect with respect to payments made more than 7 days after the date on which the notice of termination is received by the payor. At the election of the payor, the request may take effect before this deadline.<PRTPAGE P="248"/>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) (i) The term “sick pay” means any payment made to an individual which does not constitute wages (determined without regard to section 3402(o) and this section), which is paid to an employee pursuant to a plan to which the employer is a party, and which constitutes remuneration or a payment in lieu of remuneration for any period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work on account of personal injuries or sickness. The term “personal injuries or sickness” shall have the same meaning as ascribed thereto by section 105(a) and the regulations thereunder. The term “sick pay” does not include any amounts either excludable from gross income under section 104(a) (1), (2), (4) or (5) or section 105(b) or (c) or paid under section 3402(o)(1)(B). The term “sick pay” does not include amounts paid under a plan if all amounts paid under the plan are paid to individuals who are described in the first sentence of section 105(d)(4) (relating to the definition of permanent and total disability) and the regulations thereunder. Amounts paid under any other plan shall be deemed to be paid for a period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work. For sick pay paid in 1981 only, however, the payor may opt not to follow the rules of the two preceding sentences but to follow instead the rule that an employee is temporarily absent if his absence is not described in section 105(d)(4) (relating to the definition of permanent and total disability) and the regulations thereunder. An employer is not a party to the plan if the plan is a contract between only employees and a third party payor or the employer makes no contributions to provide sick pay benefits under the plan, even if the employer withholds amounts from the employees' salaries and pays the amounts over to the third party payor.</P>

                <P>Employee A works for P Company and Employee B works for Q Company. P Company has contracted with R Insurance Company for R to pay P's employees the equivalent of their normal wages when they are temporarily absent from work because of sickness or personal injury. Q Company has neither entered into such a contract, nor will it make such payments directly from it own funds. B consequently goes to S Insurance Company and purchases directly an insurance policy which will pay him the equivalent of his normal wages when he is unable to work because of sickness or personal injury. Both A and B are subsequently temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injuries. A receives payments from R and B receives payments from S. Neither the payments made by R to A nor the payments made by S to B constitute wages (determined without regard to section 3402(o) and this section). A may request that R withhold income taxes under section <PRTPAGE P="249"/>3402(o) and this section from the payments he receives because the payments are sick pay as defined in section 3402(o) and this section.

                <P>X Company contracts with Y Insurance Company for Y to pay X's employees the equivalent of their normal wages when they are temporarily absent from work because of sickness or personal injury. Y computes the amount to be paid and determines the date payment is to be made for each of X's employees. Y then instructs Z Bank to issue a check for that amount on that date. Y reimburses Z for the amount of the check plus Z's administrative costs. Under these circumstances, Z is the agent of Y and Y is the payor under section 3402(o) and this section.</P>

                <P>V Company contracts with W Company for W to pay V's employees the equivalent of their normal wages when they are temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injury. Under the contractual arrangement, V advises W of the wages normally paid to each of V's employees. V tells W when an employee of V is temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injury, and W computes the amount to be paid the employee and makes payments of sick pay to the employee during the period of the employee's absence. V subsequently reimburses W for the amount of those payments and pays W a fee for W's services. Under these circumstances, W is acting solely as the agent of V, and a payee may not request under section 3402(o) and these regulations that W withhold income taxes from his payments. However, see section 3401 and the regulations thereunder for the obligation of V to withhold income taxes from the payments that W makes as the agent of V, which are not excluded from income under section 105 and the regulations thereunder and which are wages under section 3401 and the regulations thereunder. See also § 31.3402(g)-1 (relating to supplemental wage payments) for the conditions under which a flat percentage rate of withholding may be used.</P>

However, either the employer or the employee may terminate the agreement prior to the end of such period by furnishing a signed written notice to the other. Unless the employer and employee agree to an earlier termination date, the notice shall be effective with respect to the first payment of an amount in respect of which the agreement is in effect which is made on or after the first “status determination date” (January 1, May 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year) that occurs at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is furnished.

              <SUBJECT>Extension of withholding to certain gambling winnings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Withholding obligation</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Every person, including the Government of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of any of the foregoing making any payment of “winnings subject to withholding” (defined in paragraph (b) of the section) must deduct and withhold a tax in an amount equal to the product of the third lowest rate of tax applicable under section 1(c) and the payment. The tax must be deducted and withheld upon payment of the winnings by the person making the payment (“payer”). See paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for a special rule relating to the time for making deposits of withheld amounts and filing the return with respect to those amounts. Any person receiving a payment of winnings subject to withholding must furnish the payer a statement as required in paragraph (d) of this section. Payers of winnings subject to withholding must file a return with the Internal Revenue Service and furnish a statement to the payee as required in paragraph (e) of this section. With respect to reporting requirements for certain payments of gambling winnings not subject to withholding, see section 6041 and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The tax imposed under section 3402(q)(1) and this section shall not apply (i) with respect to a payment of winnings which is made to a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation under the circumstances described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section or (ii) with respect to a payment <PRTPAGE P="252"/>of winnings from a slot machine play, or a keno or bingo game.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Winnings subject to withholding</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Winnings subject to withholding means any payment from—</P>
              <P>(i) A wager placed in a State-conducted lottery (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) but only if the proceeds from the wager exceed $5,000;</P>
              <P>(ii) A wager placed in a sweepstakes, wagering pool, or lottery other than a State-conducted lottery but only if the proceeds from the wager exceed $5,000; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other wagering transaction (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) but only if the proceeds from the wager:</P>
              <P>(A) Exceed $5,000; and</P>
              <P>(B) Are at least 300 times as large as the amount of the wager.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Total proceeds subject to withholding.</E> If proceeds from the wager qualify as winnings subject to withholding, then the total proceeds from the wager, and not merely amounts in excess of $5,000, are subject to withholding.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions; special rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rules for determining amount of proceeds from a wager</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The amount of proceeds from a wager is the amount paid with respect to the wager, less the amount of the wager.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amount of the wager in the case of horse races, dog races, and jai alai.</E> In the case of a wagering transaction with respect to horse races, dog races, or jai alai, all wagers placed in a single parimutuel pool and represented on a single ticket are aggregated and treated as a single wager for purposes of determining the amount of the wager. A ticket in the case of horse races, dog races, or jai alai is a written or electronic record that the payee must present to collect proceeds from a wager or wagers.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Amount paid with respect to a wager</E>—(A) <E T="03">Identical wagers.</E> Amounts paid with respect to identical wagers are treated as paid with respect to a single wager for purposes of calculating the amount of proceeds from a wager. Two or more wagers are identical wagers if winning depends on the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the same event or events; the wagers are placed with the same payer; and, in the case of horse races, dog races, or jai alai, the wagers are placed in the same parimutuel pool. Wagers may be identical wagers even if the amounts wagered differ as long as the wagers are otherwise treated as identical wagers under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A). Tickets purchased in a lottery generally are not identical wagers, because the designation of each ticket as a winner generally would not be based on the occurrence of the same event, for example, the drawing of a particular number.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Non-monetary proceeds.</E> In determining the amount paid with respect to a wager, proceeds which are not money are taken into account at the fair market value.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Periodic payments.</E> Periodic payments, including installment payments or payments which are to be made periodically for the life of a person, are aggregated for purposes of determining the amount paid with respect to the wager. The aggregate amount of periodic payments to be made for a person's life is based on that person's life expectancy. See §§ 1.72-5 and 1.72-9 of this chapter for rules used in computing the expected return on annuities. For purposes of determining the amount subject to withholding, the first periodic payment must be reduced by the amount of the wager.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Wager placed in a State-conducted lottery.</E> The term “wager placed in a State-conducted lottery” means a wager placed in a lottery conducted by an agency of a State acting under authority of State law provided that the wager is placed with the State agency conducting such lottery or with its authorized employees or agents. This term includes wagers placed in State-conducted lotteries in which the amount of winnings is determined by a parimutuel system.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other wagering transaction.</E> The term “other wagering transaction” means any wagering transaction other than one in a lottery, sweepstakes, or wagering pool. This term includes a wagering transaction in a parimutuel pool with respect to horse races, dog races, or jai alai.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Certain payments to nonresident aliens or foreign corporations.</E> A payment <PRTPAGE P="253"/>of winnings that is subject to withholding tax under section 1441(a) (relating to withholding on nonresident aliens) or 1442(a) (relating to withholding on foreign corporations) is not subject to the tax imposed by section 3402(q) and this section when the payee is a foreign person, as determined under the rules of section 1441(a) and the regulations thereunder. A payment is treated as being subject to withholding tax under section 1441(a) or 1442(a) notwithstanding that the rate of such tax is reduced (even to zero) as may be provided by an applicable treaty with another country. However, a reduced or zero rate of withholding of tax must not be applied by the payer in lieu of the rate imposed by sections 1441 and 1442 unless the person receiving the winnings has provided to the payer the documentation required by § 1.1441-6 of this chapter to establish entitlement to treaty benefits.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Gambling winnings treated as payments by employer to employee.</E> (i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii), for purposes of sections 3403 and 3404 and the regulations thereunder and for purposes of so much of subtitle F (except section 7205) and the regulations thereunder as relate to chapter 24, payments to any person of winnings subject to withholding under this section shall be treated as if they are wages paid by an employer to an employee.</P>

              <P>(ii) Solely for purposes of applying the deposit rules under 6302(c) and the return requirement of section 6011, the withholding from winnings shall be deemed to have been made no earlier than at the time the winner's identity is known to the payer. Thus, for example, winnings from a State-conducted lottery are subject to withholding when actually or constructively paid, whichever is earlier; however, the time for depositing the withheld taxes and filing a return with respect thereto shall be determined by reference to the date on which the winner's identity is known to the State, if such date is later than the date on which the winnings are actively or constructively paid. If a payer's obligation to pay winnings terminates other than by payment, all liabilities and requirements resulting from the requirement that the payer deduct and withhold with respect to such winnings shall also terminate.
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Statement furnished by payee</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Each person who is making a payment subject to withholding under this section must obtain from the payee a statement described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Contents of statement.</E> Each person who is to receive a payment of winnings subject to withholding under this section must furnish the payer a statement on Form W-2G or 5754 (whichever is applicable) made under the penalties of perjury containing—</P>
              <P>(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the winner accompanied by a declaration that no other person is entitled to any portion of such payment, or</P>
              <P>(ii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payee and of every person entitled to any portion of the payment.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Multiple payments.</E> If more than one payment of winnings subject to withholding is to be made with respect to a single wager, for example in the case of an annuity, the payee is required to furnish the payer a statement with respect to the first payment only, provided that the other payments are taken into account in a return required by paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Reliance on statement for identical wagers.</E> If the payee furnishes the statement which may be required pursuant to § 1.6011-3 of this chapter (regarding the requirement of a statement from payees of certain gambling winnings), indicating that the payee (and any other persons entitled to a portion of the winnings) is entitled to winnings from identical wagers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, and indicating the amount of the winnings, if any, then the payer may rely upon the statement in determining the total amount of proceeds from the wager under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Return of payer</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Every person making payment of winnings for which a statement is required under paragraph (d) of this section must file a return on Form W-2G at the Internal Revenue Service location designated in the instructions to the form on or before February 28 <PRTPAGE P="254"/>(March 31 if filed electronically) of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the payment of winnings is made. The return required by this paragraph (e) need not include the statement by the payee required by paragraph (d) of this section and, therefore, need not be signed by the payee, provided the statement is retained by the payer as long as its contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. In addition, the return required by this paragraph (e) need not contain the information required by paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section provided the information is obtained with respect to the payee and retained by the payer as long as its contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. For payments to more than one winner, a separate Form W-2G, which in no event need be signed by the winner, must be filed with respect to each such winner. Each Form W-2G must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payer;</P>
              <P>(ii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the winner;</P>

              <P>(v) Except with respect to winnings from a wager placed in a State-conducted lottery, a general description of the two types of identification (as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section), one of which must have the payee's photograph on it (except in the case of tribal member identification cards in certain circumstances as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), that the payer relied on to verify the payee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;</P>
              <P>(vi) The amount of winnings from identical wagers; and</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Identification.</E> The following items are treated as identification for purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) Government-issued identification (for example, a driver's license, passport, social security card, military identification card, tribal member identification card issued by a federally-recognized Indian tribe, or voter registration card) in the name of the payee; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,” signed by the payee that includes the payee's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and other information required by the form. A Form W-9 is not acceptable for this purpose if the payee has modified the form (other than pursuant to instructions to the form) or if the payee has deleted the jurat or other similar provisions by which the payee certifies or affirms the correctness of the statements contained on the form.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Special rule for tribal member identification cards.</E> A tribal member identification card need not contain the payee's photograph to meet the identification requirement described in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section if—</P>
              <P>(i) The payee is a member of a federally-recognized Indian tribe;</P>
              <P>(ii) The payee presents the payer with a tribal member identification card issued by a federally-recognized Indian tribe stating that the payee is a member of such tribe; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The payer is a gaming establishment (as described in § 1.6041-10(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter) owned or licensed (in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 2710) by the tribal government that issued the tribal member identification card referred to in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Transmittal form.</E> Persons making payments of winnings subject to withholding must use Form 1096 to transmit Forms W-2G to the Internal Revenue Service.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Furnishing a statement to the payee.</E> Every payer required to make a return under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must also make and furnish to each payee, with respect to each payment of winnings subject to withholding, a written statement that contains the information that is required to be included on the return under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

                <P>A purchases a lottery ticket for $1 in the State W lottery from an authorized agent of State W. On February 1, 1977, the drawing is held and A wins $5,001. Since the proceeds of the wager ($5,001—$1) are not greater than $5,000, State W is not required to withhold or deduct any amount from A's winnings.</P>

                <P>C purchases a lottery ticket for $1. On June 1, 1979, the lottery drawing is held and C wins the grand prize of $50,000, payable $500 monthly. The payer must deduct and withhold tax at a rate of 20% from each payment of winnings. Therefore, $99.80 must be withheld from the first monthly payment to B ($500−$1) × 20% = $99.80) and $100 ($500 × 20%) must be withheld from each monthly payment thereafter.</P>

                <P>Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C wins an automobile rather than the grand prize. The fair market value of the automobile on the date on which it is made available to C is $10,000. The payer must deduct and withhold a tax of $2,000 (($10,001−$1) × 20%). This may be accomplished, for example, if C pays $2,000 to the payer. Alternatively, if the payer, as part of the prize, pays all taxes required to be duducted and withheld, the payer must deduct and withhold tax not only on the fair market value of the automobile less the wager, but also on the taxes it pays that are required to be deducted and withheld. This results in a pyramiding of taxes requiring the use of an algebraic formula. Under this formula, the payer must deduct and withhold a tax of 25 percent of the fair market value of the automobile less the wager ($2,500) and, in addition, the payer must indicate on Form W-2G the amount of such winnings as $12,501 ($10,001 + 25%($10,001−$1)).</P>

It is actuarially determined that, on January 3, 1977, D's life expectancy is 5 years. Based on that determination, the proceeds from the wager paid to D on or after January 3, 1977, will exceed $5,000. Therefore, State Y must deduct and withhold $20 from each monthly payment made on or after January 3, 1977. (None of such payments is reduced by the amount of the wager because the amount of the wager was offset by the first payment of winnings which was made before January 3, 1977)).</P>

The person holding the winning ticket is entitled to proceeds of $100,000 payable either as a lump sum upon demand or $10,000 a year for 10 years. Under State law, the winning ticket must be presented to an authorized agent of State X before February 1, 1978. Until the ticket is presented, State X does not know the identity of the winner. On December 1, 1977, H, the winner, presents the winning ticket to an authorized agent of the State X lottery. The winnings are constructively paid to H on February 1, 1977. Since H, has the option of receiving the entire proceeds upon demand, State X is required to deduct and withhold $20,000 ($100,000 × 20%) from the proceeds of H's winnings on February 1, 1977; but for purposes of determining the time at which the deposit and inclusion on Form 941 of these taxes is to be made, the withholding shall be deemed to have beem made on December 1, 1977.</P>

                <P>(i) B places a $15 bet at the cashier window at the racetrack for horse A to win the fifth race at the racetrack that day. After placing the first bet, B gains confidence in horse A's prospects to win and places an additional $40 bet at the cashier window at the racetrack for horse A to win the fifth race, receiving a second ticket for this second bet. Horse A wins the fifth race, and B wins a total of $5,500 (100 to 1 odds) on those bets. The $15 bet and the $40 bet are identical wagers under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section because winning on both bets depended on the occurrence of the same event and the bets are placed in the same parimutuel pool with the same payer. This is true regardless of the fact that the amount of the wager differs in each case.</P>
                <P>(ii) B cashes the tickets at different cashier windows. Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section and § 1.6011-3, B completes a Form W-2G indicating that the amount of winnings is from identical wagers and provides the form to each cashier. The payments by each cashier of $1,500 and $4,000 are less than the $5,000 threshold for withholding, but under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, identical wagers are treated as paid with respect to a single wager for purposes of determining the proceeds from a wager. The payment is not subject to withholding or reporting because although the proceeds from the wager are $5,445 ($1,500 + $4,000 − $55), the proceeds from the wager are not at least 300 times as great as the amount wagered ($55 × 300 = $16,500).</P>

                <P>B makes two $1,000 bets in a single “show” pool for the same jai alai game, one bet on Player X to show and one bet on Player Y to show. A show bet is a winning bet if the player comes in first, second, or third in a single game. The bets are placed at the same time at the same cashier window, and B receives a single ticket showing both bets. Player X places second in the game, and Player Y does not place first, second, or third in the game. B wins $8,000 from his bet on Player X. Because winning on both bets does not depend on the occurrence of the same event, the bets are not identical bets under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. However, pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the amount of the wager is the aggregate amount of both wagers ($2,000) because the bets were placed in a single parimutuel pool and reflected on a single ticket. The payment is not subject to withholding or reporting because although the proceeds from the wager are $6,000 ($8,000 − $2,000), the proceeds from the wager are not at least 300 times as great as the amount wagered ($2,000 × 300 = $600,000).</P>

B wins $5,040 from one of the selected combinations. Pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the amount of the wager is $120, not $20 for the single winning combination of the six combinations played. The payment is not subject to withholding under section 3402(q) because the proceeds from the wager are $4,920 ($5,040 − $120), which is below the section 3402(q) withholding threshold.</P>

All Pick 6 bets on those races at that racetrack are part of a single parimutuel pool from which Pick 6 winning bets are paid. B wins $5,020 from one of his Pick 6 bets. Pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the bets are not aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of the wager because the bets are reflected on separate tickets. Assuming that the applicable rate is 25%, the racetrack must deduct and withhold $1,252 (($5,020 − $12) × 25%) because the amount of the proceeds of $5,008 ($5,020 − $12) is greater than $5,000 and is at least 300 times as great as the amount wagered ($12 × 300 = $3,600).

Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the bets are not identical bets. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the bets are not aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of the wager for either payment because they are not wagers in the same parimutuel pool.

              <SUBJECT>Withholding on distributions of Indian gaming profits to tribal members.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) (1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Section 3402(r)(1) requires every person, including an Indian tribe, making a payment to a member of an Indian tribe from the net revenues of any class II or class III gaming activity, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 2703, conducted or licensed by such tribe to deduct and withhold from such payment a tax in an amount equal to such payment's proportionate share of the annualized tax, as that term is defined in section 3402(r)(3).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Withholding tables.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the amount of a payment's proportionate share of the annualized tax shall be determined under the applicable table provided by the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Annualized amount of payment.</E> Section 3402(r)(5) provides that payments shall be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A payment may be placed on an annualized basis by multiplying the amount of the payment by the total number of payments to be made in a calendar year. For example, a monthly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount of the payment by 12. Similarly, a quarterly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount of the payment by 4.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Alternate withholding procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any procedure for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under section 3402(r) may be used, provided that the amount of tax deducted and withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the Commissioner under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the election of an Indian tribe, the amount to be deducted and withheld under section 3402(r) shall be determined in accordance with this alternate procedure.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Method of election.</E> It is sufficient for purposes of making an election under this paragraph (a)(4) that an Indian tribe evidence the election in any reasonable way, including use of a particular method. Thus, no written election is required.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional withholding permitted.</E> Consistent with the provisions of section 3402(p), a tribal member and a tribe may enter into an agreement to provide for the deduction and withholding of additional amounts from payments in order to satisfy the anticipated tax liability of the tribal member. The agreement may be made in a manner similar to that described in § 31.3402(p)-1 (with respect to voluntary withholding agreements between employees and employers).</P>

                <P>Q-1: What are the withholding requirements under section 3405 for distributions from qualified plans and section 403(b) annuities?</P>
                <P>A-1: (a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Section 3405(c), added by UCA, provides that any designated distribution that is an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in section 402(f)(2)(A)) from a qualified plan or a section 403(b) annuity is subject to income tax withholding at the rate of 20 percent unless the distributee of the eligible rollover distribution elects to have the distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover. See § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-2 of this chapter for the definition of a qualified plan and § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter for the definition of a section 403(b) annuity. For purposes of section 3405 and this section, with respect to a distribution from a qualified plan, an eligible retirement plan is a trust qualified under section 401(a), an annuity plan described in section 403(a), or an individual retirement plan (as described in § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-2 of this chapter). For purposes of section 3405 and this section, with respect to a distribution from a section 403(b) annuity, an eligible retirement plan is an annuity contract, a custodial account, a retirement income account described in section 403(b), or an individual retirement plan. If a designated distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution, it is subject to the elective withholding provisions of section 3405(a) and (b) and § 35.3405-1 of this chapter and is not subject to the mandatory withholding provisions of section 3405(c) and this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Application of other statutory provisions.</E> See § 1.401(a)(31)-1 of this chapter concerning the requirements and the procedures for electing a direct rollover under section 401(a)(31). See section 402(c)(2) and (4), and § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-3 through Q&amp;A-10 and Q&amp;A-14 of this chapter for rules to determine what constitutes an eligible rollover distribution. See § 1.402(f)-1, Q&amp;A-1 through Q&amp;A-3 and § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter concerning the notice that must be provided to a distributee, within a reasonable period of time before making an eligible rollover distribution. See § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter for guidance concerning the rollover provisions and direct rollover requirements for distributions from annuities described in section 403(b).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Effective date</E>—(1) <E T="03">Statutory effective date</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Section 3405(c), as added by UCA, applies to eligible rollover distributions made on or after January 1, 1993, even if the employee's employment with the employer maintaining the plan terminated before January 1, 1993 and even if the eligible rollover distribution is part of a series of payments that began before January 1, 1993.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Special rule for governmental section 403(b) annuities.</E> Section 522 of UCA provides a special effective date for governmental section 403(b) annuities. This special effective date appears in § 1.403(b)-2T of this chapter (as it appeared in the April 1, 1995 edition of 26 CFR part 1).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Regulatory effective date.</E> This section applies to eligible rollover distributions made on or after October 19, 1995. For eligible rollover distributions made on or after January 1, 1993 and before October 19, 1995, § 31.3405(c)-1T (as it appeared in the April 1, 1995 edition of 26 CFR part 1), applies. However, for any distribution made on or after January 1, 1993 but before October 19, 1995, a plan administrator or payor may comply with the withholding requirements of section 3405(c) by substituting any or all provisions of this section for the corresponding provisions of § 31.3405(c)-1T, if any.</P>
                <P>Q-2: May a distributee elect under section 3405(c) not to have Federal income tax withheld from an eligible rollover distribution?</P>
                <P>A-2: No. The 20-percent income tax withholding imposed under section 3405(c)(1) applies to an eligible rollover distribution unless the distributee elects under section 401(a)(31) to have the eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover. See § 1.401(a)(31)-1 and § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter for provisions concerning the requirement that a distributee of an eligible rollover distribution be permitted to elect a distribution in the form of a direct rollover.</P>
                <P>Q-3: May a distributee be permitted to elect to have more than 20-percent Federal income tax withheld from an eligible rollover distribution?</P>
                <P>A-3: Yes. Under section 3402(p), a distributee of an eligible rollover distribution and the plan administrator or payor are permitted to enter into an agreement to provide for withholding in excess of 20 percent from an eligible rollover distribution. Any agreement must be made in accordance with applicable forms and instructions. However, no request for withholding will be effective between the plan administrator or payor and the distributee until the plan administrator or payor accepts the request by commencing to withhold from the amounts with respect to which the request was made. An agreement under section 3402(p) shall be effective for such period as the plan administrator or payor and the distributee mutually agree upon. However, either party to the agreement may terminate the agreement prior to the end of such period by furnishing a signed written notice to the other.</P>

                <P>Q-4: Who has responsibility for complying with section 3405(c) relating to the 20-percent <PRTPAGE P="260"/>income tax withholding on eligible rollover distributions?</P>
                <P>A-4: Section 3405(d) generally requires the plan administrator of a qualified plan and the payor of a section 403(b) annuity to withhold under section 3405(c)(1) an amount equal to 20 percent of the portion of an eligible rollover distribution that the distributee does not elect to have paid in a direct rollover. When an amount is paid under a qualified plan distributed annuity contract as defined in § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-10 of this chapter, the payor is treated as the plan administrator. See Q&amp;A-13 of this section concerning eligible rollover distributions from a qualified plan distributed annuity contract.</P>
                <P>Q-5: May the plan administrator shift the withholding responsibility to the payor and, if so, how?</P>
                <P>A-5: Yes. The plan administrator may shift the withholding responsibility to the payor by following the procedures set forth in § 35.3405-1, Q&amp;A E-2 through E-5 of this chapter (relating to elective withholding on pensions, annuities and certain other deferred income) with appropriate adjustments, including the plan administrator's identification of amounts that constitute required minimum distributions.</P>
                <P>Q-6: How does the 20-percent withholding requirement under section 3405(c) apply if a distributee elects to have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover and to have the remainder of that distribution paid to the distributee?</P>
                <P>A-6: If a distributee elects to have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover and to receive the remainder of the distribution, the 20-percent withholding requirement under section 3405(c) applies only to the portion of the eligible rollover distribution that the distributee receives and not to the portion that is paid in a direct rollover.</P>
                <P>Q-7: Will the plan administrator be subject to liability for tax, interest, or penalties for failure to withhold 20 percent from an eligible rollover distribution that, because of erroneous information provided by a distributee, is not paid to an eligible retirement plan even though the distributee elected a direct rollover?</P>
                <P>A-7: (a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If the plan administrator reasonably relied on adequate information provided by the distributee (as described in paragraph (b) of this Q&amp;A), the plan administrator will not be subject to liability for taxes, interest, or penalties for failure to withhold income tax from an eligible rollover distribution solely because the distribution is paid to an account or plan that is not an eligible retirement plan (as defined, with respect to distributions from qualified plans, in section 402(c)(8)(B) and § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-2 of this chapter and, with respect to a distributions from section 403(b) annuities, in § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter.) Although the plan administrator is not required to verify independently the accuracy of information provided by the distributee, the plan administrator's reliance on the information furnished must be reasonable. For example, it is not reasonable for the plan administrator to rely on information that is clearly erroneous on its face.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Adequate information.</E> The plan administrator has obtained from the distributee adequate information on which to rely in making a direct rollover if the distributee furnishes to the plan administrator: the name of the eligible retirement plan; a representation that the recipient plan is an individual retirement plan, a qualified plan, or a section 403(b) annuity, as appropriate; and any other information that is necessary in order to permit the plan administrator to accomplish the direct rollover by the means it has selected. This information must include any information needed to comply with the specific requirements of § 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&amp;A-3 and Q&amp;A-4 of this chapter. For example, if the direct rollover is to be made by mailing a check to the trustee of an individual retirement account, the plan administrator must obtain, in addition to the name of the individual retirement account and the representation described above, the name and address of the trustee of the individual retirement account.</P>
                <P>Q-8: Is an eligible rollover distribution that is paid to a qualified defined benefit plan subject to 20-percent withholding?</P>
                <P>A-8: No. If an eligible rollover distribution is paid in a direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan within the meaning of section 402(c)(8), including a qualified defined benefit plan, it is reasonable to believe that the distribution is not includible in gross income pursuant to section 402(c)(1). Accordingly, pursuant to section 3405(e)(1)(B), the distribution is not a designated distribution and is not subject to 20-percent withholding.</P>
                <P>Q-9: If property other than cash, employer securities, or plan loans is distributed, how is the 20-percent income tax withholding required under section 3405(c) accomplished?</P>
                <P>A-9: When all or a portion of an eligible rollover distribution subject to 20-percent income tax withholding under section 3405(c) consists of property other than cash, employer securities, or plan loan offset amounts, the plan administrator or payor must apply § 35.3405-1, Q&amp;A F-2 of this chapter and may apply § 35.3405-1, Q&amp;A F-3 of this chapter in determining how to satisfy the withholding requirements.</P>

                <P>Q-10: What assumptions may a plan administrator make regarding whether a benefit is an eligible rollover distribution for purposes of determining the amount of a distribution that is subject to 20-percent mandatory withholding?<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
                </P>
                <P>A-10: (a) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of determining the amount of a distribution that is subject to 20-percent mandatory withholding, a plan administrator may make the assumptions described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q&amp;A in determining the amount of a distribution that is an eligible rollover distribution and a designated distribution. Section 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&amp;A-18 of this chapter provides assumptions for purposes of complying with section 401(a)(31). See § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-15 of this chapter concerning the effect of these assumptions for purposes of section 402(c).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">$5,000 death benefit.</E> A plan administrator may assume that a distribution that qualifies for the $5,000 death benefit exclusion under section 101(b) is the only death benefit being paid with respect to a deceased employee that qualifies for that exclusion. Thus, in such a case, the plan administrator may assume that the distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution to the extent that it would be excludible from gross income based on this assumption.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Required minimum distributions.</E> The plan administrator is permitted to determine the amount of the minimum distribution required to satisfy section 401(a)(9)(A) for any calendar year by assuming that there is no designated beneficiary.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Valuation of property.</E> In the case of a distribution that includes property, in calculating the amount of the distribution for purposes of applying section 3405(c), the value of the property may be determined in accordance with § 35.3405-1, Q&amp;A F-1 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>Q-11: Are there special rules for applying the 20-percent withholding requirement to employer securities and a plan loan offset amount distributed in an eligible rollover distribution?</P>
                <P>A-11: Yes. The maximum amount to be withheld on any designated distribution (including any eligible rollover distribution) under section 3405(c) must not exceed the sum of the cash and the fair market value of property (excluding employer securities) received in the distribution. The amount of the sum is determined without regard to whether any portion of the cash or property is a designated distribution or an eligible rollover distribution. For purposes of this rule, any plan loan offset amount, as defined in § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-9 of this chapter, is treated in the same manner as employer securities. Thus, although employer securities and plan loan offset amounts must be included in the amount that is multiplied by 20-percent, the total amount required to be withheld for an eligible rollover distribution is limited to the sum of the cash and the fair market value of property received by the distributee, excluding any amount of the distribution that is a plan loan offset amount or that is distributed in the form of employer securities. For example, if the only portion of an eligible rollover distribution that is not paid in a direct rollover consists of employer securities or a plan loan offset amount, withholding is not required. In addition, if a distribution consists solely of employer securities and cash (not in excess of $200) in lieu of fractional shares, no amount is required to be withheld as income tax from the distribution under section 3405 (including section 3405(c) and this section). For purposes of section 3405 and this section, employer securities means securities of the employer corporation within the meaning of section 402(e)(4)(E)(ii).</P>
                <P>Q-12: How does the mandatory withholding rule apply to net unrealized appreciation from employer securities?</P>
                <P>A-12: An eligible rollover distribution can include net unrealized appreciation from employer securities, within the meaning of section 402(e)(4), even if the net unrealized appreciation is excluded from gross income under section 402(e)(4). However, to the extent that it is excludable from gross income pursuant to section 402(e)(4), net unrealized appreciation is not a designated distribution pursuant to section 3405(e)(1)(B) because it is reasonable to believe that it is not includable in gross income. Thus, to the extent that net unrealized appreciation is excludable from gross income pursuant to section 402(e)(4), net unrealized appreciation is not included in the amount of an eligible rollover distribution that is subject to 20-percent withholding.</P>
                <P>Q-13: Does the 20-percent withholding requirement apply to eligible rollover distributions from a qualified plan distributed annuity contract?</P>
                <P>A-13: The 20-percent withholding requirement applies to eligible rollover distributions from a qualified plan distributed annuity contract as defined in Q&amp;A-10 of § 1.402(c)-2 of this chapter. In the case of an eligible rollover distribution from such an annuity contract, the payor is treated as the plan administrator for purposes of section 3405. See § 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&amp;A-17 of this chapter concerning the direct rollover requirements that apply to distributions from such an annuity contract and see § 1.402(c)-2, Q&amp;A-10 of this chapter concerning the treatment of distributions from such annuity contracts as eligible rollover distributions.</P>
                <P>Q-14: Must a payor or plan administrator withhold tax from an eligible rollover distribution for which a direct rollover election was not made if the amount of the distribution is less than $200?</P>

                <P>A-14: No. However, all eligible rollover distributions received within one taxable year of the distributee under the same plan must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached. If the plan administrator or payor does not know at the time of the first distribution (that is less <PRTPAGE P="262"/>than $200) whether there will be additional eligible rollover distributions during the year for which aggregation is required, the plan administrator need not withhold from the first distribution. If distributions are made within one taxable year under more than one plan of an employer, the plan administrator or payor may, but need not, aggregate distributions for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached. However, once the $200 threshold has been reached, the sum of all payments during the year must be used to determine the applicable amount to be withheld from subsequent payments during the year.</P>
                <P>Q-15: If eligible rollover distributions are made from a qualified plan, who has responsibility for making the returns and reports required under these regulations?</P>
                <P>A-15: Generally, the plan administrator, as defined in section 414(g), is responsible for maintaining the records and making the required reports with respect to eligible rollover distributions from qualified plans. However, if the plan administrator fails to keep the required records and make the required reports, the employer maintaining the plan is responsible for the reports and returns.</P>
                <P>Q-16: What eligible rollover distributions must be reported on Form 1099-R?</P>
                <P>A-16: Each eligible rollover distribution, including each eligible rollover distribution that is paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover, must be reported on Form 1099-R in accordance with the instructions for Form 1099-R. For purposes of the reporting required under section 6047(e), a direct rollover is treated as a distribution that is immediately rolled over to an eligible retirement plan. Distributions that are not eligible rollover distributions are subject to the reporting requirements set forth in § 35.3405-1 of this chapter and applicable forms and instructions.</P>
                <P>Q-17: Must the plan administrator, trustee or custodian of the eligible retirement plan report amounts received in a direct rollover?</P>
                <P>A-17: (a) <E T="03">Individual retirement plan.</E> If a distributee elects to have an eligible rollover distribution paid to an individual retirement plan in a direct rollover, the eligible rollover distribution is reported on Form 5498 as a rollover contribution to the individual retirement plan, in accordance with the instructions for Form 5498.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Qualified plan or section 403(b) annuity.</E> If a distributee elects to have an eligible rollover distribution paid to a qualified plan or section 403(b) annuity, the recipient plan or annuity is not required to report the receipt of the rollover contribution.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Timing</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If backup withholding is required under section 3406 on a reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)), the payor must withhold at the time it makes the payment to the payee or to the payee's account that is subject to withholding. Amounts are considered paid when they are credited to the account of, or made available to, the payee. Amounts are not considered paid solely because they are posted (e.g., an informational notation on the payee's passbook) if they are not actually credited to the payee's account or made available to the payee. See paragraph (c) of this section for the timing of withholding by a middleman.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rules for dividends.</E> For purposes of section 3406 and this section—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Record date earlier than payment date.</E> In the case of stock for which the record date is earlier than the payment date, the dividends are considered paid on the payment date.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Dividends paid in corporate reorganizations.</E> In the case of a corporate reorganization, if a payee is required to exchange stock held in the former corporation for stock in the new corporation before the dividends that have been paid with respect to the stock in the new corporation will be provided to the payee, the dividend is considered paid on the date the payee actually exchanges the stock and receives the dividend.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amounts reportable under section 6045</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, in the case of a transaction reportable under section 6045 (except in the case of forward contracts (including foreign currency contracts), regulated futures contracts, and security short sales), the obligation to withhold under section 3406 arises on the date the sale is entered on the books of the broker or the date the exchange occurs as provided in § 1.6045-1(f)(3) of this chapter. A broker (in its capacity as payor) is not required, however, to satisfy its withholding liability until payment is made. See § 31.3406(b)(3)-2(b)(2) for special rules applicable to forward contracts (including foreign currency contracts), regulated futures contracts, and security short sales.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule for interest accrued on bonds.</E> For purposes of determining the time that interest is considered paid and subject to withholding under section 3406 when bonds are sold between interest payment dates, the portion of the sales price representing interest accrued to the date of sale is considered a portion of a reportable payment of gross proceeds under section 6045 (provided that the accrued interest is not tax-exempt as described in section 103(a), relating to certain governmental obligations), and is not considered to be a payment of interest for purposes of section 6049.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Middlemen</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A person that is a middleman and is a person defined in § 31.3406(a)-2(b) or in the section on information reporting to which the payment relates must withhold <PRTPAGE P="268"/>under section 3406 at the time the reportable payment is received by or credited to the middleman. If the middleman makes or credits the reportable payment to the payee prior to the middleman's receipt of the corresponding payment, the middleman may withhold at the time the reportable payment is made or credited to the payee.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule for common trust funds.</E> A common trust fund (as defined in section 584) must withhold either—</P>
              <P>(i) At the time the reportable payment is received by or credited to the common trust fund as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) On the date on which the assets of the common trust fund are valued; or</P>
              <P>(iii) At the time the common trust fund pays or credits the reportable payment to a participant of the common trust fund.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Special rule for certain grantor trusts.</E> For grantor trusts described in § 31.3406(a)-2(b)(1) or (2), reportable payments made to the trust are treated as paid by the trust to each grantor, in an amount equal to the distribution made by the trust to each grantor, on the date that the reportable payment is paid to the trust (except for gross proceeds reportable under section 6045). Paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies to a grantor trust making a payment of gross proceeds under section 6045 subject to withholding under section 3406. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) a husband and wife filing a joint return are considered to be one grantor.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Original issue discount subject to backup withholding.</E> The amount of original issue discount, treated as interest, subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6049, but is limited to the amount of cash paid. In addition, if an original issue discount obligation, subject to reporting under section 6045, is sold prior to maturity and with respect to the seller a condition exists for imposing withholding under section 3406 on the gross proceeds, then withholding under § 31.3406(b)(3)-2 applies to the gross proceeds of the sale reportable under section 6045, and not to the amount of any original issue discount includible in the gross income of the seller for the calendar year of the sale. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.<PRTPAGE P="269"/>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount subject to backup withholding and time when backup withholding is imposed with respect to short-term obligations.</E> In the case of an obligation with a fixed maturity date not exceeding one year from the date of issue (a short-term obligation), withholding under section 3406 applies to any payment of original issue discount on the obligation includible in the gross income of the holder to the extent of the cash amount of the payment. See § 1.1273-1 of this chapter to determine the amount of original issue discount on a short-term obligation. See § 1.446-2(e)(1) of this chapter to determine the amount of a payment treated as original issue discount.</P>

The price established by the subsequent holder must then be treated as the original issue price for purposes of computing the amount of the original issue discount subject to withholding under section 3406. The price of a short-term obligation may be established by confirmation receipt or other record of a similar type or, if the obligation is redeemed by or through the person from whom the obligation was purchased or otherwise obtained, by the records of the person from whom or through whom the obligation was purchased or otherwise obtained. The subsequent holder is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the price determined under this paragraph (c)(1)(i) is correct.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> A payor may elect to disregard the price at which the subsequent holder purchased or otherwise obtained the obligation if the payor's computer or recordkeeping system on which the details of the obligation are stored is not able to accept that price without significant manual intervention.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Subsequent holder unable (or not permitted) to establish purchase price.</E> If a subsequent holder fails (or is unable, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) to establish the purchase price of the obligation, then the person redeeming the obligation must determine the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 as though the obligation had been purchased by the holder on the date of issue. If the person redeeming the obligation is the issuer of the obligation, then the issuer must determine the amount subject to withholding from its records. If a person other than the issuer of the obligation redeems the obligation and the obligation is listed in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212, List of Original Issue Discount Obligations, that person must determine the amount subject to withholding by using the issue price indicated in Publication 1212.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Transferred obligation.</E> If a short-term obligation is transferred, no part of the purchase price is considered a reportable interest payment under section 6049. Withholding under section 3406 applies, however, to the gross proceeds of the sale of the obligation if the transfer is subject to reporting under section 6045 and a condition exists for imposing withholding. For the rules regarding withholding for amounts subject to reporting under section 6045, see § 31.3406(b)(3)-2.</P>

The amount required to be withheld must not exceed the amount of the cash payment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Registered long-term obligations with cash payments prior to maturity.</E> In the case of a long-term obligation in registered form that provides for cash payments prior to maturity, withholding under section 3406 applies at the time cash payments are made to the sum of the amounts of qualified stated interest and original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder <PRTPAGE P="270"/>for the calendar year in which the cash payments are made. The amount required to be withheld at the time of any cash payment, however, must not exceed the amount of the cash payment. If more than one cash payment is made during a calendar year, the tax that is required to be withheld with respect to original issue discount must be allocated among all the expected cash payments in the ratio that each cash payment bears to the total of the expected cash payments.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Transferred registered long-term obligations with payments prior to maturity.</E> In the case of a long-term obligation that is transferred after its issuance from the original holder, the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a subsequent holder is the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of all holders during the calendar year (without regard to any amount paid by a subsequent holder at the time of transfer). If the person redeeming the obligation at maturity is the issuer of the obligation, the issuer must determine the amount subject to withholding through its records by treating the holder as if he were the original holder. If a person redeeming the obligation at maturity is a person other than the issuer of the obligation, and the obligation is listed in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212, List of Original Issue Discount Obligations, the person must determine the amount subject to withholding by using the issue price indicated in Publication 1212.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payments at maturity.</E> At maturity of the obligation, withholding applies to the sum of any qualified stated interest payment made at maturity and the total amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder during the calendar year of maturity. The amount required to be withheld at the time of the cash payment, however, must not exceed the amount of the cash payment.</P>

Hence, withholding applies to the entire amount of the distribution. If a payor is able reasonably to estimate under section 6042 and § 1.6042-3(c) of this chapter the portion of a distribution that is not a dividend, however, the payor must not withhold on that portion (which is not considered a dividend).

              <P>(ii) The payor has no reasonable basis to expect that the proportion of the distribution that is not a dividend will be substantially different for the current year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reinvested dividends.</E> In the case of a dividend paid pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan, withholding under section 3406 applies, pursuant to § 31.3406(a)-4(a), at the time and to the amount made available to the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account. At the discretion of the payor, withholding under section 3406 need not be applied to any excess of the fair market value of the shares of stock received by the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account over the purchase price of the shares (including shares acquired by the shareholder at a discount in connection with the dividend distribution) or to any fee that is paid by the payor in the nature of a broker's fee for purchase of the stock or service charge for maintenance of <PRTPAGE P="272"/>the shareholder's account. The payor must, however, treat any excess amounts and fees on a consistent basis for each calendar year.</P>

The amount subject to withholding with respect to broker reporting is the amount of gross proceeds (as determined under § 1.6045-1(d)(5) of this chapter).

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Forward contracts, including foreign currency contracts, and regulated futures contracts</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If a customer is subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a forward contract (subject to information reporting under § 1.6045-1(c)(5) of this chapter), including a foreign currency contract (as defined in section 1256(g)(2)), or a regulated futures contract (as defined in section 1256(g)(1)), or with respect to an account through which those contracts are disposed of or acquired, the broker must withhold on both of the following amounts:</P>
              <P>(A) All cash or property withdrawn from the account by the customer during the relevant year; and</P>

For this purpose, the acceptance of a warehouse receipt or other taking of delivery to close a contract is in connection with the closing of a contract only if the property acquired is disposed of by the close of the seventh trading day following the trading day that the customer takes delivery under the contract. In addition, making delivery to close a contract is in connection with the closing of a contract only if the broker is able to determine that the property used to close the contract was acquired no earlier than the seventh trading day prior to the trading day on which delivery is made. Withdrawals do not include repayments of debt incurred in connection with making or taking delivery that meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2). Withdrawals also do not include payments of commissions, fees, transfers of cash from the account to another futures <PRTPAGE P="274"/>account that is subject to this paragraph (b)(2) or cash withdrawals traceable to dispositions of property other than futures (not including profit on the contract separately reportable under § 1.6045-1(c)(5)(i)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this chapter).</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Security sales made through a margin account.</E> The amount described in paragraph (a) of this section that is subject to withholding under section 3406 in the case of a security sale made through a margin account (as defined in 12 CFR part 220 (Regulation T)) is the gross proceeds (as defined in § 1.6045-1(d)(5) of this chapter) of the sale. The amount required to be withheld with respect to the sale, however, is limited to the amount of cash available for withdrawal by the customer immediately after the settlement of the sale. For this purpose, the amount available for withdrawal by the customer does not include amounts required to satisfy margin maintenance under Regulation T, rules and regulations of the National Association of Securities Dealers and national securities exchanges, and generally applicable self-imposed rules of the margin account carrier.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Security short sales</E>—(i) <E T="03">Amount subject to backup withholding.</E> The amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a short sale of securities is the gross proceeds (as defined in § 1.6045-1(d)(5) of this chapter) of the short sale. At the option of the broker, however, the amount subject to withholding may be the gain upon the closing of the short sale (if any); consequently, the obligation to withhold under section 3406 would be deferred until the closing transaction. A broker may use this alternative method of determining the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a short sale only if at the time the short sale is initiated, the broker expects that the amount of gain realized upon the closing of the short sale will be determinable from the broker's records. If, due to events unforeseen at the time the short sale was initiated, the broker is unable to determine the basis of the property used to close the short sale, the property must be assumed for this purpose to have a basis of zero.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Time of backup withholding.</E> The determination of whether a short seller is subject to withholding under section 3406 must be made on the date of the initiation or closing, as the case may be, or on the date that the initiation or closing, as the case may be, is entered on the broker's books and records.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Fractional shares.</E> A broker is not required to withhold under section 3406 with respect to a sale of a fractional share of stock resulting in less than $20 of gross proceeds (as described in § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(x) of this chapter).</P>

In the case of payments made in settlement of third party network transactions, the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 is determined without regard to the exception for de minimis payments by third party settlement organizations in section 6050W(e) and the associated regulations.</P>

Under paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.6050W-1, X must report the amount of $100, the amount of the transaction on Day 1, without any reduction for fees or any other amount, as the gross amount of this reportable payment transaction on the annual information return filed under paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.6050W-1. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X's obligation, if any, to backup withhold arises on Day 1, the backup withholding obligation must be satisfied on Day 2, and the amount subject to backup withholding is $100 (the gross amount of the reportable payment transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.6050W-1)).</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions for backup withholding when there are no funds available</E>—(i) <E T="03">Backup withholding from an alternative source.</E> In the event there are no funds available in the source with respect to which there exists a liability to withhold under section 3406 with respect to the payee, the payor may withhold under section 3406 from another source maintained by the payee with the payor. The source from which the tax is withheld under section 3406 must be payable to at least one of the persons listed on the account subject to withholding. If the account or source is not payable exclusively to the same person or persons listed on the account subject to withholding under section 3406, then the payor must obtain a written statement from all other persons to whom the account or source is payable authorizing the payor to withhold under section 3406 from the alternative <PRTPAGE P="276"/>account or source.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payor of reportable interest or dividends (as described in section 3406(b)(2)) or of royalties (as described in section 3406(b)(3)(E)) may elect not to withhold from a payment that does not exceed $10 and that on an annualized basis does not exceed $10 (see paragraph (c) of this section). A broker or barter exchange may elect not to withhold on gross proceeds of $10 or less without regard to the annualization requirement. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Manner of making the election.</E> The election not to withhold from payments that do not exceed $10 can be made only for payments described in paragraph (a) of this section. The election may be made on a payment-by-payment basis.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">How to annualize</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> To annualize a reportable interest payment, dividend payment, or royalty payment, a payor must calculate what the amount of the payment would be if it were paid for a 1-year period (instead of the period for which it actually is paid). The annualized amount is determined by dividing the amount of the payment by the number of days in the period for which it is being paid and then multiplying that result by the number of days in the year. If the annualized amount is $10 or less, the payor may elect not to withhold on that payment regardless of whether more than $10 may be or has been paid to the payee in other reportable payments during the calendar year. Conversely, if the annualized amount is more than $10, withholding applies even if $10 or less is actually paid to the payee during the calendar year. For purposes of computing the annualized amount, the payor may assume that February always consists of 28 days and that the year always consists of 360 days. For amounts that are deposited with a payor in a new account or certificate between the dates on which the payor customarily pays or credits interest, the payor may assume that the period for which the interest is paid is the payor's customary period for paying or crediting interest.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special aggregation rule for reportable interest and dividends.</E> If a payor maintains records that reflect multiple holdings of one payee and the payor makes an aggregate payment of reportable interest or dividends (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) with respect to those multiple holdings (such as a dividend check that reflects payment on all stock owned by the payee), the payor must annualize the aggregate payment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exception for window transactions and original issue discount.</E> A payor is not required to annualize payments <PRTPAGE P="277"/>made in window transactions (as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b)) or payments of original issue discount. With respect to a window transaction, however, the payor is required to aggregate all payments made in the same transaction (e.g., payments made with respect to coupons or obligations presented for payment at the same time as described in § 1.6049-4(e)(4) of this chapter).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> Withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) applies to any reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) made with respect to an account of a payee if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies a payor under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), and the payor is required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to identify that account. After receiving the notice and identifying accounts, the payor must notify the payee, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that withholding due to notified payee underreporting has started. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the period for which withholding due to notified payee underreporting is required. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules concerning notices that the Internal Revenue Service will send to a payee before notifying a payor that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules that a payee can use to prevent withholding due to notified payee underreporting from starting or to stop it once it has started. Paragraph (h) of this section provides special rules for joint accounts of payees who have filed a joint return. See section 6682 for the penalties that may apply to a payee subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notified payee underreporting. Notified payee underreporting</E> means that the Internal Revenue Service has—</P>
              <P>(i) Determined that there was a payee underreporting (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section);</P>
              <P>(ii) Mailed at least four notices under paragraph (f)(1) of this section to the payee (over a period of at least 120 days) with respect to the underreporting; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Assessed any deficiency attributable to the underreporting in the case of any payee who has filed a return.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payee underreporting</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general. Payee underreporting</E> means that the Internal Revenue Service has determined, for a taxable year, that—</P>
              <P>(A) A payee failed to include in the payee's return of tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for that year any portion of a reportable interest or dividend payment required to be shown on that tax return; or</P>
              <P>(B) A payee may be required to file a return for that year and to include a reportable interest or dividend payment in the return, but failed to file the return.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Payments included in making payee underreporting determination.</E> The determination of whether there is payee underreporting is made by treating as reportable interest or dividend payments, all payments of dividends reported under section 6042, all patronage dividends reported under section 6044, and all interest and original issue discount reported under section 6049, regardless of whether withholding due to notified payee underreporting applies to those payments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice to payors regarding backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies a payor that a payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, the payor must—</P>
              <P>(i) Identify any accounts of the payee under the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Notify the payee and withhold under section 3406 on reportable interest or dividend payments made with respect to any identified account under the rules of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional requirements for payors that are also brokers</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A <PRTPAGE P="278"/>broker must notify the payor of a readily tradable instrument that the payee of the instrument is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting if—</P>
              <P>(A) The broker (in its capacity as a payor) receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that a payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting and the broker is required to identify an account of the payee under paragraph (c)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) The payee subsequently acquires the instrument from the broker through the same account; and</P>
              <P>(C) The acquisition of the instrument occurs after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the broker receives the notice (or on any earlier date that the broker may begin applying this paragraph (c)(2) after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Transfer out of street name.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), an acquisition includes a transfer of an instrument out of street name into the name of the registered owner (i.e., the payee).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Method of providing notice.</E> A broker must provide the notice required under this paragraph (c)(2) to the payor of the instrument with the transfer instructions for the acquisition. See § 31.3406(d)-4(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Termination of obligation to provide information.</E> The obligation of a broker to provide notice to payors under this paragraph (c)(2) terminates simultaneously with the termination of the broker's obligation to withhold (in its capacity as payor) due to notified payee underreporting on reportable interest or dividends made with respect to the account.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payor identification of accounts of the payee subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general</E>—(A) <E T="03">Notice from the Internal Revenue Service.</E> If a payor receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor must identify, exercising reasonable care, all accounts using the same taxpayer identification number for information reporting purposes as the one provided in the notice. The notice may provide, however, that the payor need only identify the account or accounts corresponding to any account number or designation and related taxpayer identification number used for information reporting purposes as that listed on the notice.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Notice from a broker.</E> If a payor receives a notice from a broker under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the payor is not required to identify any account other than the account identified in the notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exercise of reasonable care.</E> If an account identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section contains a customer identifier that can be used to retrieve systemically any other accounts that use the same taxpayer identification number for information reporting purposes, the payor must identify all accounts that can be so retrieved. Otherwise, a payor is considered to exercise reasonable care in identifying accounts subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) if the payor searches any computer or other recordkeeping system for the region, division, or branch that serves the geographic area in which the payee's mailing address is located and that was established (or is maintained) to reflect reportable interest or dividend payments.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Newly opened accounts.</E> (A) In general, a new account is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) if the payee provides to the payor a Form W-9 (or other acceptable substitute) on which the payor may reasonably rely (within the meaning of § 31.3406(h)-3(e)(2) without regard to § 31.3406(h)-3(e)(2)(v)), unless the payor has actual knowledge (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) that the statements made on the form are not true.</P>
              <P>(B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a payor is considered to have actual knowledge that a payee's statement that the payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) is not true if—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The employee or individual agent of the payor who receives the payee's certification knows that the statement is not true;<PRTPAGE P="279"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In conducting the investigation, if any, required by paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the payor identifies any other accounts of the payee that are already subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) In the course of processing the certification or in administering an account to which a certification relates, the payor discovers that the payor was previously notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and no notice was received to stop withholding pursuant to section 3406(c)(3) prior to the time of the discovery.</P>
              <P>(C) Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C), a payor is not required to investigate whether the statements made on the Form W-9 described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section are true. If, however, in opening a new account, the payor relies on the same Form W-9 (or appropriate substitute) that it relied on previously in opening another account, the payor must investigate whether any such existing account is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). Similarly, if the payor utilizes a universal account system described in the first sentence of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, and in opening a new account the payor searches its records to determine whether the new account should be identified under an existing identifier (because the payee has existing accounts with the payor), the payor must investigate whether any existing accounts identified with the same identifier are subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice from payors of backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If a payor receives notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is required to identify an account under paragraph (c)(3) of this section as an account of the payee, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section that withholding due to notified payee underreporting has started.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> The payor must send the notice required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the payee no later than 15 days after the date that the payor makes the first payment subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. The payor must send the notice by first-class mail to the payee at the payee's last known address. The notice to the payee required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section must state—</P>
              <P>(i) That the Internal Revenue Service has given notice that the payee has underreported reportable interest or dividends;</P>
              <P>(ii) That, as a result of the underreporting, the payor is required under section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code to withhold 31 percent of reportable interest or dividend payments made to the payee;</P>
              <P>(iii) The date that the payor started (or plans to start) withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C);</P>
              <P>(iv) The account number or numbers that are subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting;</P>
              <P>(v) That the payee must obtain a determination from the Internal Revenue Service in order to stop the withholding due to notified payee underreporting; and</P>
              <P>(vi) That while the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, the payee may not certify to a payor making reportable interest or dividend payments (or to a broker acquiring a readily tradable instrument for the payee) that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified underreporting.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Period during which backup withholding is required</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If a payor receives notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor must impose withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) on all reportable interest or dividend payments with respect to any account of the payee required to be identified under paragraph (c)(3) of this section made after the close of the 30th business day after the day on which the payor receives that notice and before the stop date (as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). A payor may choose to start withholding under this paragraph (e)(1) at any time during the 30-business-day <PRTPAGE P="280"/>period described in the preceding sentence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Stop withholding</E>—(i) <E T="03">When no underreporting exists or undue hardship exists</E>—(A) <E T="03">Stop date.</E> In the case of a determination under paragraph (g)(3) (i) or (iii) of this section that no underreporting exists or that an undue hardship exists, the stop date is the day that is 30 days after the earlier of—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The date on which the payor receives written notification from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (g) of this section that withholding is to stop; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The date on which the payor receives a copy of the written certification provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (g) of this section that withholding is to stop.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Acceleration of stop date.</E> A payor may choose to stop withholding at any time during the 30-day period described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">When underreporting is corrected or bona fide dispute exists.</E> In the case of a determination under paragraph (g)(3) (ii) or (iv) of this section that the underreporting has been corrected or that a bona fide dispute exists, the stop date occurs on the first day of January (immediately following a period of at least twelve months ending on October 15 of any calendar year in which the determination has been made) or if later, the stop date determined under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Dormant accounts.</E> The requirement that a payor withhold under this paragraph (e) on reportable interest or dividend payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—</P>
              <P>(i) The date that the most recent reportable interest or dividend payment was made with respect to that account; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The date that the payor received notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice to payees from the Internal Revenue Service</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice period.</E> After the Internal Revenue Service determines under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that payee underreporting exists, the Internal Revenue Service will mail to the payee at least four notices over a period of at least 120 days (the notice period) before payors will be notified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. The notices may be accompanied by, or incorporated in, other notices provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payee subject to backup withholding.</E> After the Internal Revenue Service provides the notices described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will send notices to payors under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless—</P>
              <P>(i) A payee obtains a determination under paragraph (g) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a payee who has filed a tax return, the Internal Revenue Service has not assessed the deficiency attributable to the underreporting.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Disclosure of names of payors and brokers.</E> Pursuant to section 3406(c)(5) the Internal Revenue Service may require a payee subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting to disclose the names of all the payee's payors of reportable interest or dividend payments and the names of all of the brokers with whom the payee has accounts which may involve reportable interest or dividend payments. To the extent required in the request from the Internal Revenue Service, the payee must also provide the payee's account numbers and other information necessary to identify the payee's accounts.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Backup withholding certification.</E> After a payee receives a final notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the payee is not permitted to certify to any payor or broker, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C), until the payee receives the certification from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (g) of this section advising the payee that the payee is no longer subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). A final notice will contain the information described in this paragraph (f)(4). See sections 6682 and 7205(b) for civil and criminal penalties for making a false certification.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Determination by the Internal Revenue Service that backup withholding <PRTPAGE P="281"/>should not start or should be stopped</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payee may prevent withholding due to notified payee underreporting from starting, or stop the withholding once it has started, by requesting and receiving a determination from the Internal Revenue Service under one or more of the provisions of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Following its review of a request for a determination under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will either make the determination or provide the payee with a written report informing the payee that the request for determination is being denied and the reasons for the denial. If a determination is made during the notice period (as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting with respect to any taxable year for which a determination was made. If a determination is made after the notice period, the Internal Revenue Service will, at the time prescribed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, provide written certification to a payee that withholding is to stop, and will notify payors who were contacted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section to stop withholding. A broker who (in its capacity as payor) under this paragraph (g)(1) receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a copy of the certification provided to a payee by the Internal Revenue Service is not required to provide a corresponding notice to any payors whom the broker has previously notified under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Date notice to stop backup withholding will be provided</E>—(i) <E T="03">Underreporting corrected or bona fide dispute.</E> If the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination under paragraph (g)(3) (ii) or (iv) of this section during the 12-month period ending on October 15 of any calendar year (as described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section), the Internal Revenue Service will provide the certification and the notices described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section no later than December 1 of that calendar year.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">No underreporting or undue hardship.</E> If the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination under paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (iii) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will provide the notices described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section no later than the 45th day after the day on which the Internal Revenue Service makes its determination.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Grounds for determination.</E> The Internal Revenue Service will make a determination that withholding due to notified payee underreporting should not start or should stop once it has started if the payee—</P>
              <P>(i) Shows that there was no payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) for each taxable year with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there was payee underreporting;</P>
              <P>(ii) Corrects any payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) for each taxable year with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there was payee underreporting;</P>
              <P>(iii) Shows that withholding will cause or is causing an undue hardship (as defined in paragraph (g)(6) of this section) and that it is unlikely that the payee will underreport interest or dividend payments again; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Shows that a bona fide dispute exists regarding whether any underreporting has occurred (as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section) for each taxable year with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there was payee underreporting.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">No underreporting.</E> A payee may show that no underreporting of reportable interest or dividends payments exists by presenting—</P>
              <P>(i) Receipts or other satisfactory documentation to the Internal Revenue Service showing that all taxes relating to the payments were reported; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Evidence showing that the payee did not have to file a return for the taxable year in question (e.g., because the payee did not make enough income) or that the underreporting determination was based upon a factual, clerical, or other error.<PRTPAGE P="282"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Correcting any payee underreporting</E>—(i) <E T="03">Before issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.</E> Before a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee pursuant to section 6212, the payee may correct underreporting—</P>
              <P>(A) By filing a return if one was not previously filed and including the unreported interest and dividends thereon;</P>
              <P>(B) By filing an amended return in the event a return was filed and including the unreported interest and dividends thereon; or</P>
              <P>(C) By consenting to the additional assessment according to applicable notices and forms sent to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the underreporting, and paying taxes, penalties, and interest due with respect to any underreported interest or dividend payments.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">After issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.</E> After a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee—</P>
              <P>(A) The payee may correct underreporting at any time, by filing a return if one was not previously filed and paying the entire deficiency and any other taxes including penalties and interest attributable to any payee underreporting of interest or dividend payments; or</P>
              <P>(B) The payee may correct underreporting after the mailing of the statutory notice of deficiency but before the expiration of the 90-day or 150-day period described in section 6213(a) or, if a petition is filed with the United States Tax Court, before the decision of the Tax Court is final, by making a remittance to the Internal Revenue Service of the amounts described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(A) of this section. The payee must specifically designate in writing that the remittance is a deposit in the nature of a cash bond.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Special rules.</E> For purposes of paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, the payee will not be deemed to have corrected the payee underreporting under paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section after the remittance is returned to the payee in the manner described in any applicable administrative procedure. For further guidance on a deposit in the nature of a cash bond, see subparagraph 2 of section 4.01 of Rev. Proc. 84-58 (1984-2 C.B. 501). (See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.) Once the remittance is returned to the payee, the rules of this section will apply. If the Internal Revenue Service previously contacted payors of the payee to start withholding with respect to the notified payee underreporting, however, the Internal Revenue Service will recontact those payors to start withholding under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the payee underreporting without regard to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Undue hardship</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A determination of undue hardship will be based on the overall impact to the payee of having reportable interest or dividend payments withheld at a 31 percent rate under section 3406. In addition, a determination of undue hardship will be made only if the Internal Revenue Service concludes that it is unlikely that any payee underreporting will occur again.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Factors.</E> Factors that will be considered in determining whether withholding causes undue hardship include, but are not limited to, the following—</P>
              <P>(A) Whether estimated tax payments, and other credits for current tax liabilities, or amounts withheld on employee wages or pensions, in addition to withholding under section 3406, would cause significant overwithholding;</P>
              <P>(B) The payee's health, including the payee's ability to pay foreseeable medical expenses;</P>
              <P>(C) The extent of the payee's reliance on interest and dividend payments to meet necessary living expenses and the existence, if any, of other sources of income;</P>
              <P>(D) Whether other income of the payee is limited or fixed</P>
              <P>(e.g., social security, pension, and unearned income);</P>
              <P>(E) The payee's ability to sell or liquidate stocks, bonds, bank accounts, trust accounts, or other assets, and the consequences of doing so;</P>
              <P>(F) Whether the payee reported and timely paid the most recent year's tax liability, including interest and dividend income; and</P>
              <P>(G) Whether the payee has filed a bankruptcy petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Bona fide dispute.</E> The Internal Revenue Service may make a determination under this paragraph (g)(7) if <PRTPAGE P="283"/>there is a dispute between the payee and the Internal Revenue Service on a question of fact or law that is material to a determination under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section and, based upon all the facts and circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service finds that the dispute is asserted in good faith by the payee and there is a reasonable basis for the payee's position.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Payees filing a joint return</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of this section, if payee underreporting is found to exist with respect to a joint return, then the provisions of this section apply to both payees (i.e., the husband and wife). As a result, both payees are subject to withholding on accounts in their individual names as well as accounts in their joint names. Either or both payees may satisfy the criteria for a determination that no payee underreporting exists, that the underreporting has been corrected, or that a bona fide dispute exists (as provided in paragraph (g)(3) (i), (ii), or (iv) of this section). Both payees, however, must satisfy the criteria for a determination that withholding will cause or is causing undue hardship (as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Innocent spouse.</E> A spouse who files a joint return may obtain a determination that withholding should stop or not start with respect to payments made to his or her individual accounts, if the spouse shows that—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement to backup withhold.</E> Withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) applies to a reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)) if the payee does not furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor in the manner required by this section. The period for which withholding is required is described in § 31.3406(e)-1(b). See § 31.3406(d)-3(a) and (b) for special rules when an account is established directly with, or an instrument is acquired directly from, the payor by electronic transmission or by mail, or an instrument is sold through a broker by electronic transmission or by mail. See § 31.3406(d)-4 for special rules applicable to readily tradable instruments acquired through a broker. See § 31.3406(h)-3(e) for the rules on when a payor may rely on a Form W-9. See also § 31.3406(g)-3 for rules regarding a payee awaiting receipt of a taxpayer identification number. See the applicable information reporting sections and section 6109 and the regulations thereunder to determine whose taxpayer identification number should be provided.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reportable interest or dividend account</E>—(1) <E T="03">Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to a pre-1984 account or instrument.</E> A payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor with respect to any obligation, deposit, certificate, share, membership, contract, investment, account, or other relationship or instrument established or acquired on or before December 31, 1983 (a pre-1984 account) and with respect to which the payor makes a reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)). The manner of determining whether an account or an instrument is a pre-1984 account is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The payee of a pre-1984 account may furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the <PRTPAGE P="284"/>payor orally or in writing. The payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of pre-1984 account or instrument</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> An account that is in existence before January 1, 1984, will be considered a pre-1984 account, regardless of whether additional deposits are made to the account on or after January 1, 1984. An account established as an expansion of a credit union prime account in existence prior to January 1, 1984, constitutes a pre-1984 account. If funds taken from one account in existence prior to January 1, 1984, are used to create a new account on or after that date, however, the new account does not constitute a pre-1984 account except as provided in the preceding sentence. An instrument acquired prior to January 1, 1984, is a pre-1984 account. Regardless of when an instrument was acquired, if it is negotiated in a window transaction as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b), it is treated as an instrument acquired after December 31, 1983. An obligation in bearer form and subject to reporting under section 6045, whenever acquired, is not a pre-1984 account. Any instrument, whenever acquired, that is held in a brokerage account is considered a pre-1984 account if the brokerage account is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section). If shares of a corporation are held before January 1, 1984 (or considered held before that date by operation of this paragraph (b)(2)), and additional shares are acquired by the holder, irrespective of whether the shares are received by reason of a stock dividend, investing new cash, or otherwise, the new shares, in the discretion of the payor, may be considered a pre-1984 account. In the case of a qualified employee trust that distributes instruments in kind, any instrument distributed from the trust is considered a pre-1984 account with respect to employees who were participants in the trust before 1984. Similarly, when a payor offers participants in a plan the opportunity to purchase stock of the payor after a specified time, using the money that the payee invested during that period of time, the stock so purchased after December 31, 1983, is considered a pre-1984 account with respect to participants in the plan who either owned shares or invested money in the plan before January 1, 1984.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Account or instrument automatically acquired on the maturity or termination of an account.</E> When an account is opened, or an instrument is acquired, automatically on the maturity or termination of an account that was in existence or an instrument that was held before January 1, 1984 (or considered to have been in existence or held before that date by operation of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)), without the participation of the payee, the new account or instrument, in the discretion of the payor, may be considered a pre-1984 account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payee is not considered to have participated in the acquisition of the new account or instrument solely because the payee failed to exercise a right to withdraw funds at the maturity or termination of the old account or instrument.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Insurance policies.</E> In the case of insurance policies in effect on December 31, 1983, the election of a dividend accumulation option pursuant to which interest is paid (as defined in § 1.6049-5(a)(4) of this chapter), or the creation of an account in which proceeds of a policy are held for the policy beneficiary, may, in the payor's discretion, be treated as a pre-1984 account.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Acquisitions of accounts and instruments</E>—(A) <E T="03">Pre-1984 or post-1983 status known.</E> If a payor acquires accounts or instruments of another payor (including through a tax-free reorganization under section 368), the acquiring payor must treat the persons specified in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) as having the same requirement to furnish a taxpayer identification number in the manner required under this paragraph (b) to the acquiring payor for information reporting, withholding, and related tax provisions as existed with respect to the payor whose accounts or instruments were acquired. Persons specified in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) are persons who held accounts or instruments in the other payor immediately before the acquisition and who receive an account or instrument in the acquiring payor immediately after the acquisition.<PRTPAGE P="285"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Pre-1984 or post-1983 status unknown.</E> If the acquiring payor, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, is unable to identify from the business records of the other payor whether any or all of the accounts or instruments of the persons specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section are pre-1984 (or post-1983) accounts or instruments, then the acquiring payor may treat these unidentified accounts or instruments as pre-1984 accounts or instruments.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Cross reference.</E> See § 31.3406(g)-2(g) for the limited exception from withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) on accounts or instruments described in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) (A) and (B) of this section for which the payor does not have a taxpayer identification number.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account.</E> A payee who receives reportable interest or dividend payments (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) from a payor must certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number the payee furnishes to the payor is the payee's correct taxpayer identification number. The payee must make the certification only with respect to an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). See § 31.3406(h)-3 for a description of the certificate on which the certification must be made. See § 31.3406(d)-2 for the requirement that the payee must certify under penalties of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. See § 31.3406(d)-3(a) with respect to an account established directly with, or an instrument acquired directly from, the payor by electronic transmission or by mail. See § 31.3406(d)-4 for the rules applicable to readily tradable instruments acquired through a broker.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Special rule with respect to the acquisition of a readily tradable instrument in a transaction between certain parties acting without the assistance of a broker.</E> If a payee, at any time, acquires a readily tradable instrument without the assistance of a broker, and no party to the acquisition is a broker or an agent of the payor, the payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor prior to the time reportable payments are made on the instrument. The payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the number is correct. See § 31.3406(d)-2 for the rule that a payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting with respect to a readily tradable instrument acquired in the manner described in this paragraph (b)(4). A broker is considered to provide assistance in the acquisition of an instrument if the person effecting the acquisition would be required to make an information return under section 6045 if such person were to sell the instrument. See § 31.3406(d)-4 for rules relating to an acquisition of a readily tradable instrument when a broker is involved.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Brokerage account</E>—(1) <E T="03">Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to a brokerage relationship that is not a post-1983 brokerage account</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> With respect to any instrument, investment, or deposit made through a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account, a payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the broker either orally or in writing. The payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct. See paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for the rule that any instrument, whenever acquired, that is held in a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account, is considered held in an account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account. For example, in 1983 a payee established and acquired a readily tradable instrument from a brokerage account; no activity took place through that account until the payee purchased a readily tradable instrument in 1995. That readily tradable instrument is not held in a post-1983 brokerage account; therefore, the payee need not certify under penalties of perjury that the payee's taxpayer identification number is correct.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Definition of a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account.</E> A brokerage account that was established by a payee before January 1, 1984, through which during 1983 the broker either bought or sold securities <PRTPAGE P="286"/>for the payee or held securities on behalf of the payee as a nominee (i.e., in street name), is an account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to a post-1983 brokerage account</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> With respect to a post-1983 brokerage account, the payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the broker and certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number furnished is correct, except as provided in § 31.3406(d)-3(b).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Definition of a post-1983 brokerage account.</E> A brokerage account established after December 31, 1983 (or before January 1, 1984, through which during 1983 the broker neither bought nor sold securities nor held securities on behalf of the payee as a nominee (i.e., in street name)), is a post-1983 brokerage account.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Rents, commissions, nonemployee compensation, certain fishing boat operators, and payment card and third party network transactions, etc.—Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number.</E> For accounts, contracts, or relationships subject to information reporting under section 6041 (relating to information reporting at source on rents, royalties, salaries, etc.), section 6041A(a) (relating to information reporting of payments for nonemployee services), section 6050A (relating to information reporting by certain fishing boat operators), section 6050N (relating to information reporting of payments of royalties), or section 6050W (relating to information reporting for payment card and third party network transactions), the payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor either orally or in writing. Except as provided in § 31.3406(d)-5, the payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct regardless of when the account, contract, or relationship is established.</P>

The period for which withholding applies is described in § 31.3406(e)-1(e). See § 31.3406(d)-3(a) for special rules when an account is established directly with, or an instrument is acquired directly from, the payor by electronic transmission or by mail. See § 31.3406(c)-1(c)(3)(iv) for rules with respect to a payor's reliance on a payee certification for a new account following notified payee underreporting.

              <SUBJECT>Special 30-day rules for certain reportable payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Accounts or readily tradable instruments acquired directly from the payor (including a broker who holds an instrument in street name) by electronic transmission or by mail.</E> In the case of an account established directly with, or a readily tradable instrument acquired directly from, the payor by means of electronic transmission (i.e., telephone or wire instruction) or by mail, the payor may permit the payee to furnish <PRTPAGE P="287"/>the certifications required in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) (relating to certification that the payee's taxpayer identification number is correct) and § 31.3406(d)-2 (relating to certification of notified payee underreporting) within 30 days after the establishment or acquisition without subjecting the account to withholding during the 30 days. The preceding sentence applies only if the payee furnishes a taxpayer identification number to the payor at the time of the establishment or acquisition, and the payee does not withdraw more than 69 percent of a reportable interest or dividend payment before the certifications are received within the 30 days. If the payee does not provide the required certifications within 30 days of the establishment or acquisition, the payor must withhold 31 percent of any reportable interest or dividend payments made to the account after its acquisition. For purposes of this section, an account or instrument is considered acquired directly from the payor if the instrument was acquired by the payee without the assistance of a broker or the instrument was acquired directly from a broker who holds the instrument as nominee for the payee (i.e., in street name) and who is considered a payor under § 31.3406(a)-2. For payments made after December 31, 1998, see § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter for the application of a 90-day grace period in lieu of the 30-day grace period described in this paragraph (a) if, at the beginning of the 90-day grace period, certain conditions are satisfied. If the grace period provisions of § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) or § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter are applied with respect to a new account, the grace period provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not apply to that account.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sale of an instrument for a customer by electronic transmission or by mail.</E> The special rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this section apply comparably with respect to certification of the taxpayer identification number for the sale of an instrument under section 6045 (as described in § 31.3406(b)(3)-2) through a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)) for a customer by electronic transmission or by mail. However, the 30-day rules may apply only if the payee furnishes the payee's taxpayer identification number before the sale occurs. For purposes of applying the 30-day rules under this paragraph (b), a payee's reinvestment of the gross proceeds of the sale into other instruments constitutes a withdrawal.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application to foreign payees.</E> The rules of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to a payee from whom the payor is required to obtain a Form W-8 (or an acceptable substitute) or other evidence of foreign status (pursuant to relevant regulations under an applicable Internal Revenue Code section without regard to the requirement to furnish a taxpayer identifying number, and the certifications described in §§ 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) and 31.3406(d)-2), provided the payee represents orally or otherwise, before or at the time of the acquisition or sale of the instrument or the establishment of the account, that the payee is not a United States citizen or resident. The 30-day rules described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may apply only if the payee does not qualify for, or the payor does not apply, the 90-day grace period described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) or § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(i) Obtain once with respect to each account the certifications described in § 31.3406(d)-2(a) and § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) and (c)(2) from the payee (relating to certification regarding payee underreporting and taxpayer identification number, respectively);</P>

              <P>(ii) Furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor; and<PRTPAGE P="288"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Notify the payor to impose withholding if the payee fails to make either of the required certifications to the broker or if the broker has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service before the acquisition of the instrument that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C) or that the payee is subject to withholding because the payee's taxpayer identification number is incorrect under section 3406(a)(1)(B) (as described in § 31.3406(d)-5).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional requirements.</E> The broker must give the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section to the payor with the transfer instructions for the acquisition (including account registration instructions transmitted by a broker in the case of acquisitions of shares in a mutual fund). A notice including the information described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section fulfills the broker's requirement to give notice to the payor. Once the broker transmits the transfer instructions containing the information required by this section, the broker has no further responsibility to obtain a missing taxpayer identification number or missing certification or to provide additional notices to the payee or payor with respect to the acquisition of the instrument. Upon receiving the notice from a broker, the payor must impose withholding on the account pursuant to § 31.3406(a)-1.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Transactions entered into through a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account.</E> If a broker acquires readily tradable instruments for a payee through an account (with the broker) that is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as defined in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)), and the broker is not the payor of the instruments, the broker must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor. In addition, if the broker has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406 either because of an incorrect taxpayer identification number or due to notified payee underreporting as described in section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C), respectively, the broker must notify the payor of the instrument to impose withholding with respect to that payee and transmit the information in the manner described in this paragraph (a). After a payor receives a notice from a broker pursuant to section 3406(d)(2)(B) and this paragraph (a), the payor must impose withholding on any accounts of the payee paying reportable interest or dividends as defined in section 3406(b)(2) in accordance with § 31.3406(a)-1.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Payor must notify payee</E>—(i) <E T="03">Failure to provide certifications.</E> If a payor is notified by a broker, as required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that a payee is subject to withholding because the payee failed to provide the certifications, as described in § 31.3406(d)-2(a) and § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) and (c)(2), and the payor has not received the certifications from the payee, then the payor must notify the payee that withholding has started (or will start) no later than 15 days after the payor makes the first payment to the payee that is subject to withholding under section 3406. A notice that contains the information described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section satisfies the payor's requirement to give notice to the payee. If the broker notifies the payor that the payee failed to make a required certification and the payor has received the certification from the payee, the payor may disregard the notice from the broker.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Notified payee underreporting and incorrect taxpayer identification number.</E> The payor must notify the payee under this section if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold either because of an incorrect taxpayer identification number under section 3406(a)(1)(B) (as described in § 31.3406(d)-5) or due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C) (as described in § 31.3406(c)-1). If a payor is notified by the Internal Revenue Service or a broker with respect to a readily tradable instrument, the payor may not ignore the notice even if the payee previously provided the payee's taxpayer identification number under penalties of perjury to the payor and even if the payee certified to the payor that the payee is not subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting. See § 31.3406(d)-5(c) (1) and (2) and (f)(2) for notice requirements under section <PRTPAGE P="289"/>3406(a)(1)(B) due to an incorrect taxpayer identification number. See § 31.3406(c)-1(c)(2) for notice requirements under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notices</E>—(1) <E T="03">Form of notice by broker to payor.</E> A broker who is required under paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (2) of this section to notify the payor with respect to a readily tradable instrument may notify the payor in connection with the transfer instructions by means of magnetic media, machine readable document, or any other medium, provided that the notice includes the following information—</P>
              <P>(i) The payee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (if provided to the broker); and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Backup withholding when the Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold because the payee's taxpayer identification number is incorrect.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> Backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B) applies to any reportable payment made with respect to an account of a payee if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies a payor under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section that the payee's name and taxpayer identification number combination (name/TIN combination) is incorrect and the payor is required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to identify that account as having the same name/TIN combination. After receiving a notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and identifying an account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, under paragraph (e) of this section, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made to such account after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the notice and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section. Under paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives 2 notices from the Internal Revenue Service or broker within 3 calendar years with respect to a payee's account, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) (rather than paragraph (d)) of this section. In addition, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made with respect to the account after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the second notice and on or before the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination for the account. Paragraph (h) of this section requires a payor to use a corrected name/TIN combination on subsequent information returns.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions and special rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition of incorrect name/TIN combination.</E> An incorrect name/TIN combination is a combination of a name and taxpayer identification number provided on an information return with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determines that the taxpayer identification number provided is not assigned under section 6109 to the name provided.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of account.</E> The term “account” means any account, instrument, or other relationship with the payor.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Definition of business day.</E> The term “business day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday (within the meaning of section 7503).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Certain exceptions</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> This section does not apply with respect to any notice received under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to payments that—</P>
              <P>(A) Were made to a fiduciary or nominee account; or</P>
              <P>(B) Were not reportable payments (for example, because the payments were made to an exempt recipient).</P>
              <FP>See § 301.6724-1(f)(3) of this chapter for certain solicitation rules applicable after receipt of a notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to a fiduciary or nominee account.</FP>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Definition of fiduciary or nominee account.</E> A fiduciary or nominee account is an account with respect to which at least one person named in the registration is identified as acting in the capacity as nominee or as administrator, conservator, custodian, receiver, tutor, curator, committee, executor, guardian, trustee, or other fiduciary capacity recognized under governing law.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice regarding an incorrect name/TIN combination</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the Internal Revenue Service notifies a payor that a payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect and that the <PRTPAGE P="291"/>payor must commence backup withholding as required on reportable payments made with respect to accounts of the payee with the same name/TIN combination, the payor must—</P>
              <P>(i) Identify under paragraph (c)(3) of this section any account or accounts of the payee having the same name/TIN combination;</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, notify the payee and backup withhold on reportable payments made to the account or accounts under the rules of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.</P>
              <FP>This paragraph (c)(1) also applies if the payor receives notice from a broker under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional requirements for payors that are also brokers</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A broker must notify the payor of an instrument of the information required under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if—</P>
              <P>(A) The broker (in its capacity as a payor) receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that a payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect and is required to identify an account of the payee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section as having the name/TIN combination;</P>
              <P>(B) The payee acquires through the same account with the broker a readily tradable instrument with respect to which the broker is not the payor; and</P>
              <P>(C) The acquisition of such instrument occurs after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the broker receives that notice (or on any earlier date that the broker chooses to begin applying this paragraph (c)(2)).</P>

              <FP>For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i), with respect to notices under paragraph (c)(1) of this section received on or after September 1, 1992, an acquisition includes a transfer of an instrument out of street name into the name of the registered owner, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the payee.</FP>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Required information.</E> The information required to be provided under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) is:</P>
              <P>(A) The fact that the broker was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination;</P>
              <P>(B) The incorrect name/TIN combination; and</P>
              <P>(C) The fact that the named payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B).</P>
              <FP>The broker is required to provide this information to the payor of the instrument in connection with the transfer instructions for the acquisition.</FP>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Termination of obligation to provide information.</E> The obligation of a broker to provide information to payors under this paragraph (c)(2) terminates simultaneously with the termination of the broker's obligation to backup withhold (in its capacity as payor) on reportable payments to the account.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payor identification of the account or accounts of the payee that have the incorrect taxpayer identification number</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If an account number or designation is provided in the notice received under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor need only identify any account or accounts corresponding to that number or designation that has the same name/TIN combination provided in the notice. If no account number or designation is provided in the notice received under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor must identify, using reasonable care, all accounts of the payee having the same name/TIN combination provided in the notice. If a payor receives notice from a broker under paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to the acquisition of a readily tradable instrument, the payor is not required to identify any other account of the payee.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reasonable care where no account number or designation is provided.</E> A payor who satisfies the following two-part facts-and-circumstances test will be considered to have exercised reasonable care for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3).</P>

              <P>(A) Part one of the test is satisfied if a payor searches for accounts of the payee on the computer or other recordkeeping system that the payor can reasonably associate with the information return that generated the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, a payor who maintains separate computer or recordkeeping systems for different product lines will have identified and used the appropriate system if the payor searches for accounts of the <PRTPAGE P="292"/>payee on the computer or recordkeeping system that contains the product line for the type of payments reported on the information return. A payor with the same product line on several nonintegrated computer or record systems will have identified and used the appropriate system if the payor searches for accounts of the payee on any computer or record system that the payor otherwise can reasonably associate with the information return.</P>
              <P>(B) Part two of the test is satisfied if the payor inputs the name/TIN combination provided on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section into the system that is described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. If the system of a payor cannot utilize the name/TIN combination, the payor must input appropriate data or criteria, as determined by the capability of the payor's computer or recordkeeping system.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">No identification if error is caused by payor.</E> A payor may treat an account as not having the incorrect name/TIN combination if the error resulted because the name or taxpayer identification number on such account is not the name or taxpayer identification number that was provided to the payor. This may occur, for example, where a payor transposes numbers in the taxpayer identification number when incorporating it into the payor's business records.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Special rules for joint accounts</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of a joint account, the relevant name/TIN combination for purposes of this section is the name/TIN combination used for information reporting purposes.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Transitional rule.</E> With respect to notices received under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section prior to September 1, 1993, a payor may treat the name/TIN combination of the first person on a joint account as the relevant name/TIN combination, unless that person is an exempt foreign person and the account registration includes names of persons who are not foreign persons.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Optional rule where names are switched.</E> A payor may backup withhold under this section on reportable payments made to a joint account if the order of the names (or taxpayer identification numbers) on the account is merely changed subsequent to receipt of a notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, provided that the name of the person to which the incorrect name/TIN combination originally applies remains on the account.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Date of receipt.</E> For purposes of this section, the date set forth on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or broker under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section is considered to be the date of receipt of the notice by the payor. However, if the payor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that the date of actual receipt of the notice is later than the date on the notice, the actual date of receipt is controlling.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice from payors of backup withholding due to an incorrect name/TIN combination</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and is required to identify an account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must send a copy of the notice (or an acceptable substitute notice) to the payee of the account in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The notice that a payor must send to a payee under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must comply with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery. A payor must send the notice to the payee within 15 business days after the date that the payor receives the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Two or more notices for an account for the same year or received in the same year.</E> A payor who receives, under the same payor taxpayer identification number, two or more notices under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to the same payee's account for the same year, or in the same calendar year, need only send one notice to the payee under this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Period during which backup withholding is required due to notification of an incorrect name/TIN combination</E>—(1) <PRTPAGE P="293"/>
                <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives a notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and is required to identify an account as having the same name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must impose backup withholding on all reportable payments made with respect to the account after the close of the 30th business day after the date the payor receives that notice and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the day the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Grace periods</E>—(i) <E T="03">Starting backup withholding.</E> A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup withholding under this paragraph (e) at any time during the 30-business-day period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Stopping backup withholding.</E> A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under this paragraph (e) at any time within 30 calendar days after the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Dormant accounts.</E> The requirement that a payor backup withhold under this paragraph (e) on reportable payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—</P>
              <P>(i) The date that the last reportable payment was made to that account; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The date that the payor received the notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Manner required for payee to furnish certified taxpayer identification number.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, in order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting, or to stop it once it has begun, a payee with respect to whom the payor has been notified under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) that the payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect is required on Form W-9 (or an acceptable substitute form) to—</P>
              <P>(i) Provide the payee's name and taxpayer identification number; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Certify, under penalties of perjury, that the taxpayer identification number being provided is correct.</P>
              <P>(2) The certification must be made even if the account is a pre-1984 account and even if the payment to the account is a reportable payment other than interest, dividends, patronage dividends, original issue discount, or proceeds of a sale of a security or commodity. In order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting or to stop it once it has begun, a payee is not required to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C). With respect to notices received under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section on or after September 1, 1993, the requirements of this paragraph (f) are not satisfied if a payee provides only an awaiting TIN certification. As a result, a payor must not fail to begin backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification, or stop it once it has begun solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Receipt of two notices within a 3-year period</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If a payor receives notification under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section twice within 3 calendar years, and in each case the payor is required to identify the same account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination, the payor must—</P>
              <P>(i) Disregard any future certifications (described in paragraph (f) of this section) furnished by the payee with respect to the account until the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Send the notice described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section to the payee (and not the notice required under paragraph (d) of this section) within 15 business days after the date that the payor receives the second notice; and</P>

              <P>(iii) Impose backup withholding on the account for the period described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
              </P>
              <FP>The payor must maintain sufficient records to determine whether the payor has received notices under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section twice within 3 calendar years with respect to the same account.</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to payee who has provided two incorrect name/TIN combinations within 3 calendar years.</E> The notice to the payee required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section must comply with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery.</P>

However, a payor may choose not to commence backup withholding under this paragraph (g) until January 1, 1992.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Grace periods</E>—(A) <E T="03">Starting backup withholding.</E> A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup withholding under this paragraph (g) at any time during the 30-business-day period described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Stopping backup withholding.</E> A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under this paragraph (g) at any time within 30 calendar days after the date the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the account.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Dormant accounts.</E> The requirement that a payor backup withhold under this paragraph (g) on reportable payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—</P>

              <P>(B) The date that the payor received the second notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Receipt of two notices for the same year or in the same calendar year.</E> A payor who receives, under the same payor taxpayer identification number, two or more notices under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to the same payee's account for the same year, or in the same calendar year, must treat such notices as one notice for purposes of this paragraph (g).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination.</E> The Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) will notify a payor after it validates a name/TIN combination that the payee provides for an account to which paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies. Notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (g)(5) only if it complies with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery. In order to obtain notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination for an account, a payee who receives notice from a payor under paragraph (g)(2) of this section should follow such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.</P>

A payor who uses that name/TIN combination on the first such information return satisfies the requirement of section 3406(h)(9) to provide this information to the Internal Revenue Service. If the payor is not required to file any information returns with respect to the account after the date that the payor receives the certification or notification, a payor is deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 3406(h)(9).</P>

                <P>D opened an account with Bank O prior to 1984 and furnished a taxpayer identification number to O at the time he opened the account. O pays interest on the account at the end of each calendar month, and the account is a pre-1984 account.

                <P>Individual F has two post-1983 accounts with Bank R that pay reportable interest: a savings account and a money market account. The money market account was opened in 1986, and the savings account was opened on February 1, 1991. R treats each of these accounts as a separate account on its books and records for business purposes. On October 1, 1990, the Internal Revenue Service notified R pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section that F furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination with respect to the money market account. R timely sends F the notice required under paragraph (d) of this section and receives the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section from F on November 1, 1990. On October 1, 1991, the Internal Revenue Service again notifies R that F furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination with respect to the money market account. Further, R determines from its business records that two notifications of an incorrect name/TIN combination have been received with respect to the money market account within 3 calendar years. R must send F the notice required under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and must commence backup withholding on reportable interest paid on the money market account pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section after November 14, 1991, which is 30 business days after R received the second notice. R must continue to backup withhold under paragraph (g) of this section on the money market account until R receives notification from the Social Security Administration as described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section (or, if earlier, until backup withholding terminates under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section). R is not required to <PRTPAGE P="296"/>backup withhold on the savings account unless and until it receives notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section with respect to the savings account.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Certain payments after an acquisition of accounts or instruments.</E> A payor who acquires pre-1984 accounts or instruments described in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(2)(iv) for which the payor does not <PRTPAGE P="300"/>have a taxpayer identification number or has an obviously incorrect taxpayer identification number as defined in § 31.3406(h)-1(b)(2) must start withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) and § 31.3406(d)-1 on those accounts or instruments no later than sixty days following the date of the payor's acquisition of those accounts or instruments.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Backup withholding not required for 60 days.</E> If a payor has received an awaiting-TIN certificate from a payee with respect to an account or instrument receiving reportable interest or dividends as described in section 3406(b)(2), the payor must exempt the payee from withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) during the 60-day exemption period to the extent and in the manner described in either paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section. The 60-day exemption period means the 60-consecutive-day period beginning with the day the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certificate. The payor must withhold under section 3406 beginning after the 60-day exemption period if the payor has not received a taxpayer identification number from the payee in the manner required in § 31.3406(d)-1. Regardless of whether the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate to a payor, the payor is required to withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2 on reportable interest or dividend payments as described in § 31.3406(d)-2 if the payee fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting as required in section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reserve method.</E> A payor must not withhold under section 3406 during the 60-day exemption period unless the payee (or a joint payee in the case of a joint account) desires to make a withdrawal of more than $500 of either principal or interest from the account in any single transaction during the period. If a payee (or a joint payee) desires to make a withdrawal of more than $500 during the 60-day exemption period, the payor is required under section 3406 to withhold 31 percent of all reportable payments made during the period and at the time of withdrawal unless the payee reserves 31 percent of all reportable payments made to the account during the period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative rule; 7-day grace period</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payor who receives an awaiting-TIN certificate may elect, on a payee-by-payee basis or in general, to exempt reportable interest or dividend payments to a payee from withholding under section 3406 applying the rules in paragraph (a)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Withholding on withdrawals.</E> Under this paragraph (a)(3)(ii), a payor must obtain a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee within 60 days after the date that the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certification. In addition, the payor must withhold under section 3406 on any withdrawals made after the close of 7 business days after the date the awaiting-TIN certification is received and before the earlier of the date that the payor receives a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee, the date the account is closed (in which case the payor must withhold on any reportable payment made at the time the account or relationship is closed), or the date withholding under section 3406 starts on all reportable payments made to the account, instrument, or relationship. All cash withdrawals in an amount up to the reportable payments made from <PRTPAGE P="301"/>the day after the date of receipt of the awaiting-TIN certification to the date of withdrawal are treated as reportable payments.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Withholding regardless of withdrawals.</E> Under this paragraph (a)(3)(iii), a payor must start withholding under section 3406 on the account not later than 7 business days after the date the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certification on reportable payments thereafter made to the account (whether or not the payee makes a cash withdrawal). The payor must withhold under section 3406 until the earlier of the date the payor receives a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee, the date the account is closed, or the date withholding under section 3406 starts on all reportable payments made to the account, instrument, or relationship. The payor must obtain a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee within 60 days after the date that the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certificate or undertake a mailing each year soliciting the certified taxpayer identification number from the payee until the earlier of the calendar year that the certified taxpayer identification number is received, or the calendar year in which the account is closed. However, if the account is closed in December of a calendar year, the mailing must be made after the account is closed and before January 31 of the subsequent calendar year.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Special rule for readily tradable instruments.</E> The 60-day awaiting-TIN exemption described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments only if the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate directly to the payor. If a broker acquires a readily tradable instrument through a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)) for a payee who has no taxpayer identification number, the broker must advise the payor as required in § 31.3406(d)-4(a)(1) that the payee failed to provide a taxpayer identification number under penalties of perjury, regardless of whether the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate to the broker. Once a payor is notified by a broker that a payee failed to provide a taxpayer identification number in the required manner, or that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C), the payor must impose withholding under section 3406 for the appropriate period described in § 31.3406(e)-1.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The 60-day awaiting-TIN exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to—</P>
              <P>(i) Window transactions (as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b));</P>
              <P>(ii) Redemptions of bearer obligations that are subject to reporting under section 6045; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Other amounts that are subject to reporting under section 6045 (except as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule for amounts subject to reporting under section 6045 other than proceeds of redemptions of bearer obligations.</E> If a broker's customer does not provide a taxpayer identification number to the broker, and the broker effects a sale that is subject to reporting under section 6045 (other than a redemption of a bearer obligation), § 31.3406(d)-3(b) applies, whether or not the sale is pursuant to an instruction by electronic transmission, provided the customer furnishes an awaiting-TIN certificate to the broker before the sale. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the 30-day period provided in § 31.3406(d)-3(b) is a 60-day period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Awaiting-TIN certificate.</E> A payee qualifies for the 60-day awaiting-TIN exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section if the payee furnishes a written statement to the payor, signed under penalties of perjury, that the payee has not been issued a taxpayer identification number, that the payee has applied for a taxpayer identification number or intends to apply for a number in the near future, and that the payee understands that if the payee does not provide a number to the payor within 60 days, the payor is required under section 3406 to withhold 31 percent of any reportable payment thereafter made to the payee until the payor receives a number, and 31 percent of a withdrawal to the extent of reportable payments made to the payee during the 60-day period, as described in paragraph (a) of this section. Language that is substantially similar to the <PRTPAGE P="302"/>awaiting-TIN certification on Form W-9 will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Form for awaiting-TIN certificate.</E> A payor may use Form W-9 for the awaiting-TIN certificate, or a payor may include language that is substantially similar to the awaiting-TIN certification on Form W-9 in any other document of the payor. See § 31.3406(h)-3, which provides that Form W-9 is the prescribed form but permits use of substitute forms, and specifies the length of time the payor is required to retain the form. If Form W-9 is used, the payee should write “Applied For” in the space reserved for the taxpayer identification number.</P>

Taxpayer identification number</E> means the identifying number assigned to a person under section 6109 (relating to identifying numbers, generally a nine-digit social security number for an individual and a nine-digit employer identification number for a nonindividual, e.g., a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate). An obviously incorrect number is not considered a taxpayer identification number. See § 31.6011(b)-2 and § 301.6109-1 of this chapter for provisions relating to obtaining a taxpayer identification number.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Joint accounts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Relevant name and taxpayer identification number combination.</E> For purposes of identifying the account subject to withholding under sections 3406(a)(1) (B) and (C), the relevant name and taxpayer identification number combination is that which is used for information reporting purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Optional rule for accounts subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C) where the names are switched.</E> See § 31.3406(d)-5(c)(4)(iii) under which a payor may withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(B) as required even though the names or taxpayer identification numbers on the account have been switched. The rules under § 31.3406(d)-5(c)(4)(iii) may be applied comparably by a payor who is required to withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(C).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Joint foreign payees</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the relevant payee listed on a jointly owned account or instrument provides a Form W-8 or documentary evidence described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) regarding its foreign status, withholding under section 3406 applies unless every joint payee provides the statement regarding foreign status (under the provisions of chapters 3 or 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under those provisions); any one of the joint owners who has not established foreign <PRTPAGE P="303"/>status provides a taxpayer identification number to the payor in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5; or, in the case of a withholdable payment (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(15)), any joint payee does not appear to be an individual as described in § 1.1471-3(f)(7). See § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(iii) of this chapter for corresponding joint payees provisions.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Information reporting on an account including foreign payees.</E> If any one of the joint payees who has not established foreign status provides a taxpayer identification number under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section, that number is the taxpayer identification number that is required to be furnished for purposes of information reporting and withholding under section 3406.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Backup withholding from an alternative source</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payor may not withhold under section 3406 from a source maintained by the payor other than the source with respect to which there exists a liability to withhold under section 3406 with respect to the payee. See section 3403 and § 31.3403-1, which provide that the payor is liable for the amount required to be withheld regardless of whether the payor withholds.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions for payments made in property</E>—(i) <E T="03">Backup withholding from alternative source.</E> In the case of a payment that is made in property (other than money), the payor must withhold under section 3406, 31 percent of the fair market value of the property determined immediately before or on the date of payment. The payor may withhold under section 3406 from the principal amount being deposited with the payor or from another source maintained by the payee with the payor. The source from which the tax is withheld under section 3406 must be payable to at least one of the persons listed on the account subject to withholding. If the account or source is not payable exclusively to the same person or persons listed on the account subject to withholding under section 3406, then the payor must obtain a written statement from all other persons to whom the account or source is payable authorizing the payor to withhold under section 3406 from the alternative account or source. A payor that elects to withhold under section 3406 from an alternative source may determine the account or source from which the tax is to be withheld, or may allow the payee to designate the alternative source. A payee may not, however, require a payor to withhold under section 3406 from a specific alternative source. See § 31.3402(q)-1(d), <E T="03">Example 5,</E> for methods of withholding on prizes, awards, and gambling winnings paid in property other than cash.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Deferral of withholding.</E> If the payor cannot locate, using reasonable care (following procedures substantially similar to those set forth in § 31.3406(d)-5(c)(3)(ii) (A) and (B)), an alternative source of cash from which the payor may satisfy its withholding obligation pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the payor may defer its obligation to withhold under section 3406, except for reportable payments of property made in connection with prizes, awards, or gambling winnings, until the earlier of—</P>
              <P>(A) The date the payor makes a cash payment to the account subject to withholding under section 3406 or cash is otherwise deposited in the account in a sufficient amount to satisfy the obligation in full; or</P>
              <P>(B) The close of the fourth calendar year after the obligation arose.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Barter exchanges.</E> In the case of a barter exchange that issues scrip to, or credits the account of, a member or client of the exchange in payment for property or services, the barter exchange may withhold under section 3406 from—</P>
              <P>(A) The scrip or credit, if converted to cash in order to satisfy the deposit requirements of section 6302 and § 31.6302-4; or</P>
              <P>(B) Any other source maintained by the exchange for the member or client in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Trusts.</E> Withholding under section 3406 applies to reportable payments made to a trust if any of the conditions for imposing withholding under section 3406 apply to the trust. Generally, a trust is not a payor and will not be required to withhold under section 3406 on reportable payments that it makes to its beneficiary who is subject to <PRTPAGE P="304"/>withholding under section 3406. The preceding sentence does not apply, however, to a grantor trustdescribed in § 31.3406(a)-2(b)(1) or (2), which is treated as a payor. The trustee of a trust described in this paragraph (c) may certify that the trust's taxpayer identification number is correct and that the trust is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, without regard to the status of the beneficiaries of the trust.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustment of prior withholding by middlemen.</E> A middleman payor (as defined in § 31.3406(a)-2(b) or in the section on information reporting to which the payment relates) who receives a payment from which tax has been erroneously withheld under section 3406 may seek a refund of the tax withheld by the payor from whom the middleman payor received the payment (referred to as the “upstream payor”). Alternatively, the middleman payor may obtain a refund of the tax by claiming a credit for the amount of tax withheld by the upstream payor against the deposit of any tax imposed by this chapter which the middleman payor is required to withhold and deposit (as described in section 6413 and § 31.6413(a)-2). In either case, the middleman payor must pay or credit the gross amount of the payment (including the tax withheld) to its payee as though it had received the gross amount of the payment from the upstream payor and must withhold under section 3406 only if one of the conditions for imposing backup withholding exists with respect to its payee. If its payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406, the payor must pay or credit the full amount of the payment to the payee, unless, with respect to payments made after December 31, 2000, the payor chooses to apply prior withholding under section 3406 to an amount required to be withheld under another section of the Internal Revenue Code (such as under section 1441) to the extent permitted under procedures prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). See § 31.6413(a)-3 regarding repayment by a payor of tax erroneously collected from a payee.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Conversion of amounts paid in foreign currency into United States dollars</E>—(1) <E T="03">Convertible foreign currency.</E> If a payment is made in a currency other than the United States dollar, the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 is determined by applying the statutory rate of backup withholding to the foreign currency payment and converting the amount withheld into United States dollars on the date of payment at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)(1) of this chapter) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. For example, a withholding agent may use a month-end spot rate or a monthly average spot rate. A spot rate convention must be used consistently with respect to all non-dollar amounts withheld and from year to year. Such convention cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Coordination with other sections.</E> For purposes of section 31, chapter 24 (other than section 3402(n)) of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to employment taxes and collection of income tax at source) and so much of subtitle F (other than section 7205) of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to procedure and administration) as relates to this chapter, and the regulations thereunder—</P>

              <P>(3) An amount withheld under section 3406 must be deposited as required under § 31.6302-4;</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Wages</E> includes the gross amount of any reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)) except for purposes of section 6014 (relating to an election by the taxpayer not to compute the tax on his annual return);</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Employee</E> includes a payee of any reportable payment; and</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Employer</E> includes a payor who is required to withhold the tax under section 3406 (as defined in § 31.3406(a)-2) with respect to any reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Tax liabilities and penalties.</E> A payor is subject to the same civil and criminal penalties for failing to impose <PRTPAGE P="305"/>withholding under section 3406 as an employer who fails to withhold on a payment of wages. In addition, a broker may be subject to the penalty under section 6705 (failure of a broker to provide notice to a payor).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">To whom payor is liable for amount withheld.</E> A payor is not liable to any person for any amount withheld under section 3406. A payor is liable only to the United States for an amount that is required to be withheld as provided in § 31.3403-1.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Effective/applicability date.</E> This section applies to payments made on or after January 6, 2017. (For payments made after June 30, 2014, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2016.)</P>

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the payee must sign under penalties of perjury and date the Form W-9 in order to satisfy the requirements of this section. A payor or broker may require a payee to furnish a separate Form W-9 for each obligation, deposit, certificate, share, membership, contract, or other instrument, or one Form W-9 for all the payee's obligations or relationships with the payor or broker. In addition, a payee of a mutual fund that has a common investment advisor or common principal underwriter with other mutual funds (within the same family of funds) may be permitted, in the discretion of the mutual fund, to provide one Form W-9 with respect to shares acquired or owned in any of the funds.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Forms prepared by payors or brokers—(1) Substitute forms; in general.</E> A payor or broker may prepare and use a form that contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the official Form W-9. A payor or broker may use any document relating to the transaction, such as the signature card for an account, so long as the certifications are clearly set forth. A payor or broker who uses a substitute form may furnish orally or in writing the instructions for the Form W-9 that relate to the account. A payor or broker may refuse to accept certifications (including the official Form W-9) that are not made on the form or forms provided by the payor or broker. A payor or broker may refuse to accept a certification provided by a payee only if the payor or broker furnishes the payee with an acceptable form immediately upon receipt of an unacceptable form or within 5 business days of receipt of an unacceptable form. An acceptable form for this purpose must contain a notice that the payor or broker has refused to accept the form submitted by the payee and that the payee must submit the acceptable form provided by the payor in order for the payee not to be subject to withholding under section 3406. If the payor or broker requires the <PRTPAGE P="306"/>payee to furnish a form for each account of the payee, the payor or broker is not required to furnish an acceptable form until the payee furnishes the payor or broker with the payee's account numbers. A payor or broker may use separate substitute forms to have a payee certify under penalties of perjury that—</P>
              <P>(i) The payee's taxpayer identification number is correct; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406 due to notified payee underreporting.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form for exempt recipient.</E> A payor or broker may use a substitute form for the payee to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is an exempt recipient (described in § 31.3406(g)-1 or described in the respective reporting section), provided the form contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the official Form W-9 relating to exempt recipients. A certificate must be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable to exempt recipients on Form W-9, and must set forth fully and clearly the data called for therein. If a payor will treat the payee as an exempt recipient only if the payee files a certificate as to its exempt status, the certificate is valid only if it contains the payee's taxpayer identification number. Thus, a payee must include the payee's taxpayer identification number on a certificate that a payor requires to be made in order to treat the payee as an exempt recipient.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rule for brokers.</E> A broker may act as the payee's agent for purposes of furnishing a taxpayer identification number or certification to a payor with respect to any readily tradable instrument (as defined in § 31.3406(h)-1(d)) provided the payee provides a taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form to the broker. The payor may rely on a taxpayer identification number provided by the broker unless certification is required (as described in § 31.3406(d)-4) and the broker notifies the payor that the number was not certified.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reasonable reliance on certificate</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payor is not liable for the tax imposed under section 3406 if the payor's failure to deduct and withhold the tax is due to reasonable reliance, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, on a Form W-9 (or other acceptable substitute) required by this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Circumstances establishing reasonable reliance.</E> For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a payor can reasonably rely on a Form W-9 (or other acceptable substitute) unless—</P>
              <P>(i) The form does not contain the name and taxpayer identification number of the payee (or does not state, in lieu of a taxpayer identification number, that the payee is awaiting receipt of a taxpayer identification number (i.e., an awaiting-TIN certificate));</P>
              <P>(ii) The form is not signed and dated by the payee;</P>
              <P>(iii) The form does not contain the statement, when required, that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting;</P>
              <P>(iv) The payee has deleted the jurat or other similar provisions by which the payee certifies or affirms the correctness of the statements contained on the form; or</P>
              <P>(v) For purposes of section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payor is required to subject the account to which the form relates to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) under the circumstances described in § 31.3406(c)-1(c)(3)(iii).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Who may sign certificate</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form may be signed by any person who is authorized to sign a declaration under penalties of perjury on behalf of the payee as provided in section 6061 and the regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign generally for an individual, which includes certain agents who may sign returns and other documents), section 6062 and the regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign corporate returns), and section 6063 and the regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign partnership returns).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notified payee underreporting.</E> A payee who has not been notified that he is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) as a result of notified payee underreporting may make the certification related to notified payee underreporting. In addition, a payee who was subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified <PRTPAGE P="307"/>payee underreporting may certify that he is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting if the Internal Revenue Service has provided the payee with written certification that withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting has terminated.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Retention of certificates</E>—(1) <E T="03">Accounts or instruments that are not pre-1984 accounts and brokerage relationships that are post-1983 brokerage accounts.</E> With respect to an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3)), or with respect to a brokerage relationship that is a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)), a payor or broker who receives a Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form related to withholding under section 3406 must retain the form in its records for 3 years from the date the account is opened or the instrument is purchased. The form may be retained on microfilm or microfiche.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Accounts or instruments that are pre-1984 accounts and brokerage relationships that are not post-1983 brokerage accounts.</E> With respect to a pre-1984 account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(1)) or with respect to a brokerage relationship that is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)), a payor or broker is not required to retain any Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form. If, however, the payor or broker requires the payee to file only one Form W-9 or substitute form for all accounts or instruments of the payee, the payor or broker must retain the single form in the manner and for the period of time described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if that form relates to any account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account or relates to a post-1983 brokerage account. If a payee has certified that the payee is an exempt recipient described in § 31.3406(g)-1, the payor or broker must retain the form unless the payor or broker can establish the existence of procedures that are reasonably calculated to ensure that a payee who has so certified is accurately identified in the payor's or broker's records.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) matching program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">The matching program.</E> Under section 3406(i), the Commissioner has the authority to establish Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) matching programs. The Commissioner may prescribe in a revenue procedure (<E T="03">see</E> § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or other appropriate guidance the scope and the terms and conditions of participating in any TIN matching program. In general, under a matching program, prior to filing information returns with respect to reportable payments as defined in section 3406(b)(1), a payor of those reportable payments who is entitled to participate in the matching program may contact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the <PRTPAGE P="308"/>TIN furnished by a payee who has received or is likely to receive a reportable payment. The IRS will inform the payor whether or not a name/TIN combination furnished by the payee matches a name/TIN combination maintained in the data base utilized for the particular matching program. For purposes of this section, the term payor includes an agent designated by the payor to participate in TIN matching on the payor's behalf.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of incorrect TIN.</E> No matching details received by a payor through a matching program will constitute a notice regarding an incorrect name/TIN combination under § 31.3406(d)-5(c) for purposes of imposing backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application of section 3406(f).</E> The provisions of section 3406(f), relating to confidentiality of information, apply to any matching details received by a payor through the matching program. A payor may not take into account any such matching details in determining whether to open or close an account with a payee.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reasonable cause.</E> The IRS will not use either a payor's decision not to participate in an available TIN matching program or the results received by a payor from participation in a TIN matching program implemented under the authority of this section as a basis to assert that the payor lacks reasonable cause under section 6724(a) for the failure to file an information return under section 6721 or to furnish a correct payee statement under section 6722. If the establishment of reasonable cause may be relevant to a substantial number of the participants in a TIN matching program implemented under the authority of this section, the extent to which, if any, a payor may establish reasonable cause by participating in the TIN matching program will be set forth in the guidance establishing the program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Question and answer relating to the time employers must collect and pay the taxes on noncash fringe benefits (Temporary).</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following questions and answers relate to the time employers must collect and pay the taxes imposed by subtitle C on noncash fringe benefits:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Q-1:</E> If a noncash fringe benefit constitutes “wages” under section 3121(a), 3306(b), or 3401(a), or constitutes “compensation” under section 3231(e), when must an employer collect and pay the taxes imposed by Subtitle C?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A-1:</E> For purposes of an employer's liability to collect and pay the taxes imposed by Subtitle C, an employer may deem such fringe benefit to be paid at any time on or after the date on which it is provided, as long as such date is on or before the last day of the calendar quarter in which such benefit is provided. An employer may consider the benefit to be provided in two or more parts for purposes of the preceding sentence. For example, if a fringe benefit with a fair market value of $1,000 is provided on January 1, 1985, the employer could deem $500 paid on February 28, 1985 and $500 paid on March 31, 1985.</P>
              <P>With respect to noncash fringe benefits provided during the first calendar quarter of 1985, a special rule applies. Such benefits may be deemed paid at any time on or after the date on which they are provided as long as the date they are deemed paid is on or before the last day of the second calendar quarter of 1985.</P>

              <P>In addition, for purposes of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i), the term “tax” does not include the employer tax under section 3111 with respect to noncash fringe benefits which are deemed by the employer to be paid on the last day of any calendar quarter. <PRTPAGE P="309"/>For purposes of the first sentence of § 31.6302(c)-2(a)(1), the phrase “employer tax imposed after December 31, 1983, under section 3221 (a) and (b)” will not include any such employer tax with respect to noncash fringe benefits which are deemed by the employer to be paid on the last day of the quarter; provided that for purposes of deposits required under § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(v), such first sentence applies to such noncash fringe benefits.</P>
              <P>Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if an employer in fact withholds, the amount withheld is subject to the general deposit rules.</P>
              <P>The manner in which and the time at which the employer withholds amounts from the wages of an employee to pay the taxes imposed under section 3101, 3201, and/or 3402 will generally be left to be determined by the employer and the employee. Any delay in withholding, however, does not affect the employer's obligation upon the filing of an employment tax return, to pay amounts which would be due under this subtitle if the employer had withheld, with respect to noncash fringe benefits, the amount which would have been required to be withheld if such noncash fringe benefits had been paid in cash on the date the benefits were deemed paid. However, if such amounts are not withheld from the wages of an employee within a reasonable period after payment of the taxes by the employer, payment by the employer may be deemed additional compensation of the employee.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Q-2:</E> Are any fringe benefits excepted from the rules contained in Q/A-1 of this section?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A-2:</E> Yes. The rules contained in Q/A-1 of this section do not apply to the transfer of personal property (both tangible and intangible) of a kind held for investment or to the transfer of real property. Accordingly, an employer is liable for the collection and payment of taxes imposed by this subtitle when such property is transferred. For example, stock transferred in connection with the performance of services is paid, for purposes of this subtitle C, on the date the stock is transferred, i.e., on the date the stock vests pursuant to section 83 (absent a section 83(b) election).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Q-3:</E> What is an example of the application of the rules contained in Q/A-1 of this section with respect to obligations under Chapters 21 and 24 of subtitle C?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A-3:</E> All of employer A's employees received $100 in cash as wages each week from A. In addition, during a calendar quarter, each such employee receives noncash fringe benefits, the fair market value of which is $500. A deems all such noncash fringe beneftis to be paid on the last day of the quarter. As of the end of the quarter, no amount has been withheld from the employee's wages with respect to such noncash fringe benefits, and A has “undeposited taxes” (within the meaning of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i)) of more than $3,000 attributable to amounts actually withheld under section 3102 or section 3402 or due under section 3111 with respect to cash wages of A's employees. The amount which A must deposit within 3 banking days after the end of the quarter will be determined without regard to the noncash fringe benefits deemed paid on the last day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>During the month following the quarter, A withholds from its employees with respect to the noncash fringe benefits deemed paid on the last day of the quarter. As A withholds amounts, such amounts become “taxes” subject to § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i). If, as of the date of filing of the return for the period which includes the last day of the quarter, A has not deposited all amounts with respect to the quarter which are due under section 3111 or which would have been due had A withheld, under sections 3102 and 3402, with respect to noncash fringe benefits, the amount which would have been required to be withheld had such benefits been paid in cash, A shall pay the balance with its return. A must make such payment regardless of whether, at the time the return is filed, he has actually withheld all amounts which he would have been required to withhold had such benefits been paid in cash.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Q-4:</E> If an employee is provided with a noncash fringe benefit and separates from service before the benefit is deemed paid by the employer, is the employer liable for the taxes imposed by subtitle C?<PRTPAGE P="310"/>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A-4:</E> Yes. The employer's liability is unaffected by his ability to collect the tax from the former employer.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Q-5:</E> If an entity other than the employer provides a noncash fringe benefit to an employee, is that entity considered the employer of such employee with respect to such noncash fringe benefit for any purposes of subtitle C?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A-5:</E> The provision of noncash fringe benefits by an entity to an employee of another employer does not make such entity the employer of such employee with respect to such noncash fringe benefit for any purpose of subtitle C, so long as such noncash fringe benefits are incidental to the provision of wages by the employer to such employee. For example, if two unrelated airlines, A and B, enter into a reciprocal agreement where by the parents of employees of both airlines are entitled to free flights on both airlines, the fact that A is providing a noncash fringe benefit to the employees of B generally will not make A the employer of such employees for purposes of subtitle C.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Q-6:</E> Do special rules apply to the provision of taxable noncash fringe benefits by a nonemployer under a reciprocal agreement with the employee's employer?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A-6:</E> If the provision of taxable noncash fringe benefits meets the requirements of Q/A-5 of this section, the nonemployer provider of the benefits is not required to withhold. The employer must take the steps necessary to obtain the relevant information from the provider of the benefits in order to enable the employer to satisfy, in a timely manner, its obligations under subtitle C to collect and pay taxes with respect to the noncash fringe benefits provided by the nonemployer.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Q-7:</E> For purposes of subtitle C, how is the fair market value of an employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle during any time period to be determined?</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">A-7:</E> The value of the availability of an employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle must be determined under the rules provided in ;§§ 1.61-21 and 1.132-1 of this chapter. (For purposes of this section, the terms “automobile” and “road vehicle” have the meaning given those terms in § 1.61-21). For example, assume that an employee adopts the special rule provided in § 1.61-21 and that the Annual Lease Value, as defined in § 46*1.61-21, of an automobile or other road vehicle is $2,100. The automobile or other road vehicle is provided to employee A on January 1, 1985. As of March 31, A had driven the automobile or other road vehicle 1,000 personal miles and 3,000 miles in the course of his employer's business. For the quarter, A would have had wages of $131.25 attributable to his personal use of the automobile or other road vehicle computed by subtracting a $393.75 working condition fringe from $525 ($2,100 divided by 4). See section 132(d) and § 1.132-1T. During the second quarter of 1985, A drives the automobile or other road vehicle only 1,000 miles, all of which are personal. In order to calculate the value of the wages provided to A in the second quarter in the form of the availability of the employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle, first A's employer calculates the Annual Lease Value attributable to the first six months of 1985 which is $1,050 ($2,100 divided by 2). Second, A's employer calculates the working condition fringe exclusion which is $630 ($1,050 multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is A's business mileage (3,000 miles) and the denominator of which is A's total mileage (5,000 miles)). The calculations result in a total inclusion of $420 ($1,050—$630). From the total inclusion of $420, the wages provided in the first quarter, $131.25, are subtracted, leaving $288.75 as the wages includible in the second quarter attributable to the availability to A of the employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle.</P>

              <P>Q-8: May an employer treat any part of the Annual Lease Value or Daily Lease Value (as defined in 1.61-21 of this chapter ), or the fair market value if the special rule of 1.61-21 of this chapter is not or cannot be used, of an automobile or other road vehicle made available to an employee as includible in the employee's gross income without regard to whether the employee has used the automobile or other road vehicle in the employer's business?<PRTPAGE P="311"/>
              </P>
              <P>A-8: No, except as otherwise provided in this Q/A-8, an employer may not include any amount in an employee's income with respect to an employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle unless such inclusion is based on:</P>
              <P>(a) Records or a statement submitted by an employee that contain the business and total mileage for the period beginning on January 1, 1985, and ending on the last day of the employer's taxable year that began in 1984, or</P>
              <P>(b) Records that satisfy the employer's “adequate contemporaneous record” requirement under section 274(d)(4) and the regulations thereunder for the employer's taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984.</P>
              <FP>For example, an employer who is subject to (b) of this Q/A-8 may rely on a statement submitted by the employee indicating for the period the number of miles driven by the employee in the employer's business and the total number of miles driven by the employee unless the employer knows or has reason to know the statement submitted is not based on “adequate contemporaneous records”. (For purposes of this section, if a road vehicle is available to any person and such availability would be taxable to an employee, miles driven by that person will be considered miles driven by the employee).</FP>
              <P>Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph of this Q/A-8, an employer may include in an employee's income the value of the availability of an employer-provided road vehicle, calculated without regard to a working condition fringe exclusion based on business mileage if one of the conditions listed in § 1.274-6T(f)(1) is satisfied with respect to the relevant period.</P>
              <P>In addition, the employer must, before including any amount in an employee's income with respect to an employer-provided road vehicle, take into account other working condition fringe exclusions, such as the security exclusion discussed in § 1.132-1T. If proper calculation of an exclusion requires information from the employee and the employee does not respond within a reasonable period of time to a request for that information or produces information which the employer knows or has reason to know is not accurate, the employer may disregard such exclusion in reporting the employee's gross income.</P>
              <P>Q-8a: May an employer withhold amounts attributable to noncash fringe benefits on the basis of average wages as permitted under section 3402(h)(1)?</P>
              <P>A-8a: In general, yes. In estimating wages under section 3402(h)(1)(A), however, the employer must take into account estimated business use of the benefit (such as an employer-provided road vehicle). In no event, however, may the amount reported by the employer as “wages” for any employee for any quarter be based on an estimation.

              <P>
                <E T="03">A-10:</E> An employer may treat the payment of any noncash fringe benefit as the payment of supplemental wages. Thus, if noncash fringe benefits are provided and tax has been withheld from the employee's regular wages, the employer may determine the tax to be withheld with respect to such noncash fringe benefits by using a flat percentage rate of 20 percent, without allowance for exemptions and without reference to any regular payment of wages. For example, assume that during a calendar quarter A receives from his employer a taxable noncash fringe benefit with a fair market value of $1,000. If the requirements specified <PRTPAGE P="312"/>above are satisfied, A's employer may determine the tax to be withheld with respect to such benefit by using a flat percentage rate of 20 percent. The employer may also determine the tax to be withheld with respect to such benefit by use of the method described in § 31.3402 (g)-1(a)(2).</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> Corporation P enters into an agreement with Employer, effective January 1, 2015. Under the agreement, Corporation P hires the Employer's employees as its own employees and provides them back to Employer to perform services for Employer. Corporation P also assumes responsibility to make payment of the individuals' wages and for the collection, reporting, and payment of applicable taxes. For all pay periods in 2015, Employer provides Corporation P with an amount equal to the gross payroll (that is, wage and tax amounts) of the individuals, and Corporation P pays wages (less the applicable withholding) to the individuals performing services for Employer. Corporation P also reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, <E T="03">Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,</E> filed for each quarter of 2015 under Corporation P's employer identification number. Corporation P is not a common paymaster, the employer of the individuals (including an employer within the meaning of section 3401(d)(1)), or treated as the employer of the individual under section 3121(a)(2)(A). Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> Same facts as <E T="03">Example 1,</E> except that Corporation P only reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, <E T="03">Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,</E> filed for the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2015. Neither Corporation P nor Employer files returns for the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2015. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> Same facts as <E T="03">Example 1,</E> except that neither Corporation P nor Employer reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, <E T="03">Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,</E> for any quarter of 2015. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> Same facts as <E T="03">Example 1,</E> except that Employer provides only net payroll (that is, wages less tax amounts) to Corporation P for each pay period. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all <PRTPAGE P="315"/>quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Example 5.</E> Same facts as <E T="03">Example 1,</E> except that after Corporation P reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, <E T="03">Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,</E> filed for each quarter of 2015 under Corporation P's employer identification number, Corporation P files a claim for refund of the employment taxes it paid for each quarter of 2015 that are related to wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer. The basis for Corporation P's refund claim is that Corporation P is not the employer of the individuals that performed services for Employer. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Accordingly, Corporation P is not entitled to a refund. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Example 6.</E> Corporation S enters into an agreement with Employer, effective January 1, 2015. Under the agreement, Corporation S provides payroll services, including payment of wages to individuals performing services for Employer, and assumes responsibility for the collection, reporting, and payment of applicable taxes. For all pay periods in 2015, Employer provides Corporation S with an amount equal to the gross payroll (that is, wage and tax amounts) of the individuals, and Corporation S pays wages (less the applicable withholding) to the individuals performing services for Employer. Corporation S also reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, <E T="03">Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,</E> filed for each quarter of 2015 under Employer's employer identification number. Corporation S is not designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation S paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Corporation S did not assert it was the employer and filed Forms 941 using Employer's employer identification number. Accordingly, Corporation S is not liable for the applicable employment taxes under this section. Employer remains subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Example 7.</E> Corporation T enters into a consulting agreement with Manufacturer effective January 1, 2015, to provide consulting services to Manufacturer. Corporation T is responsible to pay wages to the individuals providing the consulting services to Manufacturer and to collect, report, and pay the applicable taxes. Corporation T has the right to direct and control the individuals as to when and how to perform the consulting services and, thus, is the common law employer of the individuals providing the consulting services. Corporation T is not designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation T pays to individuals providing consulting services to Manufacturer. However, as the common law employer of the individuals, Corporation T is subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Example 8.</E> On January 1, 2015, Corporation U enters into an agreement with Employer for Employer to farm Corporation U's property. Under the agreement, Corporation U and Employer agree to split the proceeds of the sale of the products grown on the property. Employer hires workers to assist it with the farming. Employer has the right to direct and control the workers as to when and how to perform the services and, thus, is the common law employer of the workers. However, Employer is unable to pay the workers until after the products are sold. Therefore, Corporation U pays wages to the workers and deducts this amount from Employer's share of the profits. Corporation U controls the payment of wages within the meaning of section 3401(d)(1). Corporation U is not designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation U paid to workers providing services for Employer. However, as the section 3401(d)(1) employer of the workers performing services for Employer, Corporation U is subject to all <PRTPAGE P="316"/>provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Example 9.</E> Corporation V and Employer execute and submit a Form 2678, <E T="03">Employer/Payer Appointment of Agent,</E> to the Service, requesting approval to authorize Corporation V to report, deposit, and pay taxes with respect to wages it pays, as agent of Employer for purposes of Form 941, <E T="03">Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return.</E> The Form 2678 is approved by the Service and effective for all quarters of 2015. Accordingly, Corporation V reports the wages it pays to individuals performing services for Employer and related tax amounts on Form 941 and Schedule R (Form 941), <E T="03">Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers,</E> filed for each quarter of 2015 under Corporation V's employer identification number. Corporation V is not designated under this section to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation V paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. However, as an agent authorized under § 31.3504-1(a), Corporation V is subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages. Employer also remains subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Effective/applicability date.</E> These final regulations are effective for wages or compensation paid by a payor in quarters beginning on or after March 31, 2014.</P>

However, because E furnished only a portion of the total net wages, E is liable for $3,375 of the taxes required to be deducted and withheld ($4,500 × $15,000/$20,000).</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Ordinary working capital loan.</E> The provisions of section 3505(b) do not apply in the case of an ordinary working capital loan made to an employer, even though the person supplying the funds knows that part of the funds advanced may be used to make wage payments in the ordinary course of business. Generally, an ordinary working capital loan is a loan which is made to enable the borrower to meet current obligations as they arise. The person supplying the funds is not obligated to determine the specific use of an ordinary working capital loan or the ability of the employer to pay the amounts of tax required by subtitle C of the Code to be deducted and withheld. However, section 3505(b) is applicable where the person supplying the funds has actual notice or knowledge (within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) at the time of the advance that the funds, or a portion thereof, are to be used specifically to pay net wages, whether or not the written agreement under which the funds are advanced states a different purpose. Whether or not a lender has actual notice or knowledge that the funds are to be used to pay net wages, or merely that the funds may be so used, depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, a lender, who has actual notice or knowledge that the withheld taxes will not be paid, will be deemed to have actual notice or knowledge that the funds are to be used specifically to pay net wages where substantially all of the employer's ordinary operating expenses consist of salaries and wages even though fund for other incidental operating expenses may be supplied pursuant to an agreement described as a working capital loan agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definition of other person</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> As used in this section, the term “other person” means any person who directly pays the wages or supplies funds for the specific purpose of paying the wages of an employee or group of employees of another employer. It does not include a person acting only as agent of the employer or as agent of the employees.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

                <P>Pursuant to an agreement between L, a labor union, and M, an employer, M makes monthly vacation payments (of a sum equal to a certain percentage of the remuneration paid to each union member employed by M during the previous month) to a union administered pool plan under which each employee's rights are fully vested and nonforfeitable from the time the money is paid by M. Vacation allowances are accumulated by the plan and distributed to eligible employees during their vacations. L, acting <PRTPAGE P="318"/>merely as a conduit with respect to these payments, would incur no liability under section 3505.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>N, a construction company, maintains a payroll account with the O Bank in which N deposits its own funds. Pursuant to an automated payroll service agreement between N and O, O prepares payroll checks and earnings statements for each of N's employees reflecting the net pay due each such employee. These checks are delivered to N for signature. After the checks are signed, O distributes them directly to N's employees on the regularly scheduled pay day. O, acting only in the capacity of a disbursing agent of N's funds, would incur no liability under section 3505 with respect to these payroll distributions. However, O may incur liability under section 3505 in the capacity of a lender if it supplies the funds for the payment of wages.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of taxes and interest</E>—(1) <E T="03">Procedure for payment.</E> A lender, surety, or other person may satisfy the personal liability imposed upon him by section 3505 by executing Form 4219 and filing it, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax and interest due the United States, in accordance with the instructions for the form. In the event that the lender, surety, or other person does not satisfy the liability imposed by section 3505, the United States may collect the liability by appropriate civil proceedings commenced within 10 years after assessment of the tax against the employer.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of payment</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A person paying the amounts of tax required to be deducted and withheld by subtitle C of the Code as a result of section 3505 and this section is not required to pay the employer's portion of the payroll taxes upon those wages, or file an employer's tax return with respect to those wages, or furnish annual wage and tax statements to the employees.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amounts paid by a lender, surety, or other person.</E> Any amounts paid by the lender, surety, or other person to the United States pursuant to this section shall be credited against the liability of the employer on whose behalf those payments are made and shall also reduce the total liability imposed upon the lender, surety, or other person under section 3505 and this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Amounts paid by the employer.</E> Any amounts paid to the United States by an employer and applied to his liability under subtitle C of the Code shall reduce the total liability imposed upon that employer by subtitle C. Such payments will also reduce the liability imposed upon a lender, surety, or other person under section 3505 except that such liability shall not be reduced by any portion of an employer's payment applied against the employer's liability under subtitle C which is in excess of the total liability imposed upon the lender, surety, or other person under section 3505. For example, if a lender supplies $1,000 to an employer for the payment of net wages, upon which $300 withholding tax liability is imposed, a part-payment of $25 by the employer which is applied to this liability would reduce the employer's total liability under subtitle C of the Code by that amount, but the liability imposed upon the lender by section 3505(b) in an amount equal to the withholding tax liability of the employer, which is limited to 25 percent of the amount supplied by him, would remain $250. However, if the employer makes another payment of $200 which is applied to his liability for the withholding taxes, the lender's liability under section 3505 attributable to the withholding taxes is reduced by $175 ($225 less $50 (the amount by which the employer's liability exceeds the lender's liability after application of the limitation)). Thus, after the second payment by the employer, the lender's liability under section 3505(b) is $75 ($250 less $175), plus interest due on the underpayment for the period of underpayment, to a maximum of $250, 25 percent of the funds supplied.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Extensions of the period for collection.</E> Prior to the expiration of the 10-year period for collection after assessment against the employer, the lender, surety, or other third party may agree in writing with the district director, service center director, or compliance center director to extend the 10-year period for collection. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. If any timely proceeding in court for the collection of the tax and any applicable interest is commenced, the period during which such tax and interest may be collected <PRTPAGE P="319"/>shall be extended and shall not expire until the liability for the tax (or a judgment against the lender, surety, or other third party arising from such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Returns required by employers and statements for employees.</E> This section does not relieve the employer of the responsibilities imposed upon him to file the returns and supply the receipts and statements required under subchapter A, Chapter 61 of the Code (relating to returns and records).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Time when liability arises.</E> The liability under section 3505 and this section of a lender, surety, or other person paying or supplying funds for the payment of wages is incurred on the last day prescribed for the filing of the employer's Federal employment tax return (determined without regard to any extension of time) in respect of such wages.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Companion sitting placement services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Companion sitting placement service.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “companion sitting placement service” means a person (whether or not an individual) engaged in the trade or business of placing sitters with individuals who wish to avail themselves of the sitters' services.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sitters.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “sitters” means individuals who furnish personal attendance, companionship, or household care services to children or to individuals who are elderly or disabled.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General rule.</E> For purposes of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to employment taxes), a companion sitting placement service shall not be treated as the employer of its sitters, and the sitters shall not be treated as the employees of the placement service. However, the rule of the preceding sentence shall apply only if the companion sitting placement service neither pays nor receives (directly or through an agent) the salary or wages of the sitters, but is compensated, if at all, on a fee basis by the sitters or the individuals for whom the sitting is performed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Individuals deemed self-employed.</E> Any individual who, by reason of this section, is deemed not to be the employee of a companion sitting placement service shall be deemed to be self-employed for purposes of the tax on self-employment income (see sections 1401-1403 and the regulations thereunder in Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations)).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Scope of rules.</E> The rules of this section operate only to remove sitters and companion sitting placement services from the employee-employer relationship when, under §§ 31.3121(d)-1 and 31.3121(d)-2, that relationship would otherwise exist. Thus, if, under §§ 31.3121(d)-1 and 31.3121(d)-2, a sitter is considered to be the employee of the individual for whom the sitting is performed rather than the employee of the companion sitting placement service, this section has no effect upon that employee-employer relationship.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

                <P>X is an agency that places babysitters with individuals who desire babysitting services. X furnishes all the sitters with an instruction manual regarding their conduct and appearance, requires them to file semimonthly reports, and determines the total fee to be charged the individual for whom the sitting is performed. Individuals who need a babysitter contact the agency, are informed of the charges, and, if agreement is reached, a sitter is sent to perform the services. The sitter collects the entire amount of the charges and remits a percentage to X as a fee for the placement. X is a companion sitting placement service within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Therefore, since the agency does not actually pay or receive the wages of the sitters, X is not treated as the employer of the sitters for purposes of this subtitle. The sitters are deemed to be self-employed for the purpose of the tax imposed by section 1401.</P>

                <P>Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the individual for whom the sitting is performed pays to X the entire amount of the charges. X retains a percentage and pays the difference to the sitter. Since X actually receives and pays the wages of the sitters, X is the employer of the sitters.</P>

Parents in need of a sitter contact the association and are provided with a list of names and telephone numbers. The association charges no fee for the service and takes no action other than compiling the list of sitters and making it available to members of the community. Issues such as hours of work, amount of payment, and the method by which the services are performed are all resolved between the sitter and parent. A, a parent, used the list to hire B to sit for A's child. B performs the services four days a week in A's home and follows specific instructions given by A. Under § 31.3121(d)-1, B is the employee of A rather than the employee of the neighborhood association. Consequently, this section does not apply and B remains the employee of A.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Advance payments of earned income credit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Every employer paying wages after June 30, 1979, to an employee with respect to whom an earned income credit advance payment certificate is in effect must, at the time of paying the wages, also pay the employee the advance earned income credit amount of that employee. For the purposes of applying this section and § 31.3507-2—</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of an individual who receives wages which are subject to income tax withholding, the term “employee” has the same meaning as set forth in section 3401(c) and the regulations thereunder, and the term “wages” has the same meaning as set forth in sections 3401(a) and 3402(e) and the regulations under those sections; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of an individual who does not receive wages which are subject to income tax withholding, but who receives wages which are subject to employee FICA taxes, the term “employee” has the same meaning as set forth in section 3121(d) and the regulations thereunder and the term “wages” has the same meaning as set forth in section 3121(a) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <FP>An individual not having wages subject to either income tax withholding or employee FICA taxes is not entitled to advance payments of the earned income credit. Moreover, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, employers are not required to pay advance earned income credit amounts to agricultural workers paid on a daily basis. For this purpose an “agricultural worker” is an employee who performs “agricultural labor”, as that term is defined in section 3121(g) and the regulations thereunder.</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Cross references.</E> For determination of the advance earned income credit amount of an employee, see paragraph (b) of this section. For rules relating to the treatment of the payment of an employee's advance earned income credit amount as equivalent to payment by the employer of withholding and FICA taxes, see paragraph (c) of this section. For rules describing the earned income credit advance payment certificate, see § 31.3507-2 (a) and (b). For rules relating to the employee's furnishing of the earned income credit advance payment certificate and the payroll periods for which the certificate is effective, see § 31.3507-2 (c) and (d).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Advance earned income credit amount.</E> The advance earned income credit amount of an employee is determined, with respect to any payroll period, on the basis of the employee's wages from the employer for the period and in accordance with the advance amount tables prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and then in effect for the payroll period. See, however, paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The advance amount paid is reflected on the employee's W-2 form as a separate item (and neither as a reduction of withholding nor an increase in compensation). For purposes of applying this section and § 31.3507-2, the term “payroll period” has the meaning set forth in section 3401(b) and the regulations thereunder. As required by section 3507(c)(2)(A), these advance amount tables must be similar in form to, and coordinated with, the tables prescribed under section 3402 (relating to income tax collected at the source). Sections 3507(c)(2)(B) and 3507(c)(2)(C) <PRTPAGE P="321"/>provide, respectively, separate rules for the treatment in the advance amount tables of the advance earned income credit of the following two separate classes of employees:</P>
              <P>(1) Employees who are not married (within the meaning of section 143), or employees whose spouses do not have an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect; and</P>
              <P>(2) Employees whose spouses have an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect.</P>
              <FP>If during the calendar year an employer has paid an employee amounts of earned income, within the meaning of section 43(c)(2)(A)(i), which in the aggregate equal or exceed $10,000, the employer need not make further payments of advance earned income credit to the employee during that calendar year.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of advance earned income credit amount as payment of withholding and FICA taxes</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> (i) The provisions of this paragraph (c) apply for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Payments of advance earned income credit amounts pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not constitute the payment of compensation. These payments by the employer are treated as made—</P>
              <P>(A) First, from the aggregate amount, with respect to all employees, required to be deducted and withheld for the payroll period under section 3401 (relating to income tax withholding);</P>
              <P>(B) Second, from the aggregate amount, with respect to all employees, required to be deducted for the payroll period under section 3102 (relating to employee FICA taxes); and</P>
              <P>(C) Third, from the aggregate amount of the taxes imposed for the payroll period under section 3111 (relating to employer FICA taxes).</P>
              <FP>For purposes of the requirements of sections 3401, 3102, and 3111, as the case may be, and 6302, amounts equal to the advance earned income credit amounts paid to employees are treated as if paid to the Treasury Department on the day on which the wages (and advance amounts) are paid to the employees. The employer must report the payment and treatment of the advance amounts on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943, as the case may be, in accordance with the applicable instructions.</FP>

              <P>(ii) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                <P>Employer X has ten employees, each of whom is entitled to advance earned income credit payment of $10. The total of advance amounts paid by the employer to the ten employees for the payroll period is $100. The total of income tax withholding for the payroll period is $90. The total of employee FICA taxes for the payroll period is $61.30, and the total of employer FICA taxes for the payroll period is also $61.30. Under the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the total of advance amounts paid to employees is treated as if X had paid the Treasury Department on the day X paid the employees' wages: first, the $90 aggregate amount of income tax withholding; and second, $10 of the aggregate amount of employee FICA tax. X remains liable only for $112.60 of the aggregate FICA tax [$51.30 + $61.30 = $112.60].</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Advance payments exceeding taxes due.</E> (i) if, for any payroll period, the aggregate amount of advance earned income credit amounts required to be paid by an employer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds the sum of the amounts for the payroll period referred to in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A) through (C) of this section, the employer reduces each advance amount paid for the payroll period by an amount which bears the same ratio to the excess of the advance amounts as the subject advance amount bears to the aggregate of advance amounts for the payroll period. However, this paragraph (c)(2) does not apply if the employer makes the election provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>

                <P>Assume the same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, except that the employer is a state government which does not pay FICA taxes. Under these facts, the advance amounts would be $10 greater than the $90 total of income tax withholding for the payroll period. Assume 10 employees each receiving $10 in advance payments. Under the rule of this paragraph (c)(2), the employer X reduces the amount of the advance amount paid to each employer by <FR>1/10</FR>, computed as follows: $10/$100=<FR>1/10</FR>. This is the same result as would be obtained by reducing the advance payment of $10 for each <PRTPAGE P="322"/>of the ten employees by one-tenth 10/100 of the $10 excess or $1.00.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Election to treat excess amounts as advance tax payment.</E> In lieu of reducing advance payments under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an employer may elect under this paragraph (c)(3) to pay in full all advance earned income credit amounts. However, if no election is made, the employer is required to reduce advance amounts paid in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The election, if made, applies to all advance earned income credit amounts required to be paid for the payroll period. The employer reflects the election on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943 as the case may be, and must specify (with supporting computations) the amount of the excess of advance amounts paid and the payroll period to which the excess relates. Separate elections may be made for separate payroll periods. The excess of advance amounts paid is treated as an advance payment by the employer of employment taxes described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section and due for the period reported on the Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943 which includes the payroll period during which the excess amounts were paid. The amount of the excess advance payment is applied to the amounts of the employer's liability—</P>
              <P>(i) First, for income tax withholding due under section 3401 for the reporting period in which the payment is made;</P>
              <P>(ii) Second, for employee FICA taxes due under section 3102 for the reporting period in which the payment is made; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Third, for employer FICA taxes due under section 3111 for the reporting period in which the payment is made.</P>
              <FP>If the amount of the employment taxes (as described) for which the employer remains liable for the reporting period in which the excess payment is made is less than the excess payment, the employer may claim a refund of that portion of the excess amount paid which exceeds the employer's remaining liability for these taxes for the reporting period. This refund may be claimed, in the same manner as a refund of wage withholding taxes paid by the employer under section 3401, on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943, as the case may be, for the reporting period. In the absence of a claim for refund, that portion of the excess amount will be applied by the Internal Revenue Service against the employer's liability for employment taxes reported on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943, as the case may be, filed for the next reporting period.</FP>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Failure to make advance payments.</E> The failure to pay an employee, at the time required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, all or any part of an advance earned income credit amount as required by this section is treated, for all purposes including penalties, as a failure by the employer as of that time to deduct and withhold under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 an amount equal to the advance amount (or part thereof) not paid. This treatment applies to the failure to pay an advance amount to an eligible employee without regard to whether the employee is ultimately not entitled to claim the earned income credit (in full or in part) on a return for the year, so long as the employee has a valid earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect with the employer at the time when the wages were paid. If an employer fails to pay an advance earned income credit amount as required under this section, the advance amount will not be collected by the Internal Revenue Service from the employer if the employer has properly withheld and deposited all income taxes and FICA taxes applicable with respect to the employee. However, such amount may be collected if the employer has not properly withheld and deposited these taxes.</P>

              <P>(2) Certifies that the employee does not have an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect for the calendar year (in which the wages are paid) with respect to the payment of wages by another employer, and</P>
              <P>(3) States if the employee's spouse has an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect with any employer. For the rule for determining if an employee's spouse has a certificate in effect, see paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and content of earned income credit advance payment certificate</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Form W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate) is the prescribed form for the earned income credit advance payment certificate. The Form W-5 must be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto and must set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. In lieu of the prescribed form, a form the provisions of which are identical with those of the prescribed form may be used.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Invalid certificates.</E> A Form W-5 does not meet the requirements of section 3507 or this section and is invalid if it is not completed or signed or contains an alteration or unauthorized addition (as defined in § 31.3402(f)(5)-1(b) (1) and (2)). Any earned income credit advance payment certificate which the employee clearly indicates to be false by oral statement or written statement to the employer must be treated by the employer as a certificate which is invalid as of the date of the employee's statement. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “employer” includes any individual authorized by the employer to receive earned income credit advance payment certificates or to make payroll distributions. If an employer receives from an employee an invalid certificate, the employer must consider it a nullity with respect to all payments of wages thereafter to the employee and must inform the employee of the certificate's invalidity. The employer is not required to ascertain whether any completed and signed earned income credit advance payment certificate is correct. However, the employer should inform the district director if the employer has reason to believe that the certificate contains any incorrect statement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">When earned income credit advance payment certificate takes effect</E>—(1) <E T="03">No previous certificate.</E> An earned income credit advance payment certificate furnished the employer where no previous certificate is or has been in effect with the employer for that employee for the calendar year takes effect with—</P>
              <P>(i) The date of the beginning of the first payroll period ending on or after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer;</P>
              <P>(ii) The date of the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period on or after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The first day of the calendar year for which the certificate is furnished, if that day is later than the otherwise applicable effective date specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Previous certificate.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2), an earned income credit advance payment certificate furnished the employer where a previous certificate is or has been in effect with the employer for that employee for the calendar year takes effect on the date of the first payment of wages made on or after the first status determination date (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) occurring at least thirty days after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer. However, if the employer so chooses, the employer may treat the certificate as effective on the date of any payment of wages made on or after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer (without regard to any status determination date).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Certificate of spouse.</E> For the sole purpose of applying paragraph (a)(3) of this section, in determining if a certificate is in effect with respect to an employee's spouse, the spouse's certificate is treated as then in effect if the spouse's certificate will be or is reasonably expected to be in effect on the first status determination date following the date on which the employer receives the employee's certificate.<PRTPAGE P="324"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Status determination date.</E> For the purposes of this section, the term “status determination date” means January 1, May 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Period during which certificate remains in effect; change of status</E>—(1) <E T="03">Period certificate remains in effect.</E> An earned income credit advance payment certificate which takes effect during a calendar year continues in effect with respect to the employee only during that calendar year and until revoked by the employee or until another certificate takes effect. See paragraphs (d)(2) and (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Change of status</E>—(i) <E T="03">Revocation of certificate.</E> If, after an employee has furnished an earned income credit advance payment certificate—</P>
              <P>(A) The employee no longer wishes to receive advance earned income credit payments; or</P>
              <P>(B) There has been a change of circumstances which has the effect of either making the employee ineligible for the earned income credit for the taxable year or causing a certificate to be in effect for the employee's spouse, then the employee must revoke the certificate previously furnished by furnishing the employer a new certificate (Form W-5 or identical form) in revocation of the earlier certificate. Depending upon the nature of the change of circumstances, the employer may be required, pursuant to the new certificate, to pay further advance earned income credit amounts to the employee (but in different amounts than previously paid to the employee). The Form W-5 (or identical form) must be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto and must set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. In the case of revocation due to change of circumstances, the new certificate in revocation must be delivered to the employer within ten days after the employee first learns of the change of circumstances. The new certificate is effective under the rules provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for later certificates. A new certificate furnished by an employee which is invalid within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section is considered a nullity with respect to all payments of wages thereafter to the employee. The prior certificate of the employee remains in effect, unless the employee clearly indicates by an oral or written statement to the employer that the prior certificate is invalid. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <FP>The employer is not required to ascertain whether any employee has experienced a change of circumstances described in subdivision (i)(B) of this paragraph which necessitates the employee's furnishing a new certificate. However, the employer should inform the district director if the employer has reason to believe than an employee has experienced a change of circumstances as described if the employee does not deliver a new certificate to the employer within the ten day period.</FP>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Change in spouse's certificate.</E> If, after an employee has furnished an earned income credit advance payment certificate stating that a certificate is in effect for the spouse of the employee, the certificate of the spouse is no longer in effect, the employee may furnish the employer with a new certificate which reflects this change of circumstances.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(5) of this section and in § 31.6011(a)-5 every employer is required to make a return for the first calendar quarter in which the employer pays wages, other than wages for agricultural labor, subject to the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and is required to make a return for each subsequent calendar quarter (whether or not wages are paid therein) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Except as otherwise provided in § 31.6011(a)-8 and in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,” is the form prescribed for making the return required by this paragraph (a)(1). Such return shall not include wages for agricultural labor required to be reported on any return prescribed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The return shall include wages received by an employee in the form of tips only to the extent of the tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Employers of agricultural workers.</E> Every employer who pays wages for agricultural labor with respect to taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act must make a return for the first calendar year in which the employer pays such wages and for each subsequent calendar year (whether or not wages are paid) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees,” is the form prescribed for making the annual return required by this section, except that, if <PRTPAGE P="330"/>the employer's principal place of business is in Puerto Rico, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for Puerto Rico, the return must be made on Form 943-PR, “Planilla para la Declaración ANUAL de la Contribución Federal del Patrono de Empleados Agrícolas.” However, Form 943 is the form prescribed for making such return in the case of every employer of agricultural workers who is required pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-4 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Employers of domestic workers.</E> Schedule H (Form 1040), “Household Employment Taxes,” is the form prescribed for use by every employer in making a return as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in respect of wages, as defined in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, paid by the employer in any calendar year for domestic service as defined in section 3510. Schedule H (Form 1040) is generally filed as an attachment to an income tax return; however, if the employer does not otherwise have an obligation to file an income tax return, Schedule H (Form 1040) may be filed as a separate return. If, however, the employer is required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to make a return on Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,” or under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to make a return on Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return For Agricultural Employees,” or under paragraph (a)(5) of this section to make a return on Form 944, “Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,” the employer may choose instead to report wages with respect to domestic workers on such Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. If such wages are included on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944, the employer must also include Federal unemployment tax for the employee(s) on Form 940, “Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return,” under the provisions of § 31.6011(a)-3.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Employers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5), Form 941-PR, “Planilla para la Declaracion Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono,” is the form prescribed for use in making the return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of every employer whose principal place of business is in Puerto Rico, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for Puerto Rico. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5), Form 941-SS, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands),” is the form prescribed for use in making the return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of every employer whose principal place of business is in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for these U.S. possessions. Form 941 (or Form 944, as described under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, if the IRS notified the employer that Form 944 must be filed in lieu of Form 941) is the form prescribed for making the return in the case of every employer who is required pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-4 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Employers in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944)</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Employers notified of their qualification for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) are required to file Form 944, “Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,” instead of Form 941 (or Form 941-SS or Form 941-PR under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) to make a return as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Upon proper request by the employer, the IRS will notify employers in writing of their qualification for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944). The IRS will notify employers when they no longer qualify for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) and must file Forms 941 instead. Qualified employers are those with an estimated annual employment tax liability (that is, social security, Medicare, and withheld Federal income taxes) of $1,000 or less for the entire calendar year, except employers required under—<PRTPAGE P="331"/>

              <FP>the employee shall make a return for the calendar year in respect of the employee tax not collected by the employer. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the return shall be made on Form 1040. The form to be used by residents of the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa is Form 1040SS. In the case of a resident of Puerto Rico who is not required to make a return of income under section 6012(a), the form to be used is Form 1040SS, except that Form 1040PR shall be used if it is furnished by the Internal Revenue Service to such resident for use in lieu of Form 1040SS.</FP>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Employers.</E> Every employer shall make a return for the first return period after 1954 within which compensation taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act is paid to his employee or employees for services rendered after 1954, and for each subsequent return period (whether or not taxable compensation is paid therein) until he has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. For calendar years after 1975, the return period shall be the calendar year; for calendar years prior to 1976, the return period shall be the calendar quarter. Form CT-1 is the form prescribed for making the return required under this paragraph. One original and a duplicate of each return on Form CT-1 shall be filed with the director of the service center.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Employee representatives.</E> Every employee representative shall make a return for the first calendar quarter after 1954 within which he is paid taxable compensation for services rendered after 1954 as an employee representative, and for each subsequent calendar quarter (whether or not he is paid taxable compensation therein) until he has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Form CT-2 is the form prescribed for making the return required under this subparagraph. One original and a duplicate of each return on Form CT-2 shall be filed with the director of the service center.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When to report compensation</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, compensation taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act shall be reported in the return required under this section for the period in which it is deemed, under paragraph (d) of § 31.3231(e)-1 to be paid, unless under such section the compensation may be deemed to be paid in more than one return period, in which case it shall be reported only in the return for the first return period in which it is deemed to be paid.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Pre-1976 returns of employers required by State law to pay compensation on weekly basis</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If any employer is required by the laws of any State to pay compensation weekly in any calendar year prior to 1976, the return of tax with respect to such compensation may, at the election of such employer, cover all payroll weeks which, or the major part of which, fall within the period for which a return of tax is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. This provision shall not apply, however, to any payroll week which falls in two calendar years. Any employer who elects to file a return as provided in this subparagraph shall notify the district director in writing of such election and shall include therein a statement setting forth the facts which entitle him to make the election. Such notice shall be in duplicate and shall be attached to the original and duplicate of the return for the first period to which such election applies. Any election so made shall be binding upon the employer with respect to all returns subsequently made by him <PRTPAGE P="333"/>until the director of the service center authorizes or directs the employer to make a return on a different basis. For the purpose of determining the time when compensation is deemed to be paid in accordance with paragraph (d) of § 31.3231(e)-1 and of determining the due date of a return in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 31.6071(a)-1, the calendar month following the period covered by the return of an employer making such election is the same calendar month which would be determinative for such purposes if the employer had not made the election.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Prior elections.</E> An election made by an employer, pursuant to the provisions of 26 CFR (1939) 410.501(b) (Regulations 100) or of 26 CFR (1939) 411.601 (b) (Regulations 114), which is in force and effect at the time the employer makes his first return under this section shall satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section with respect to the making of an election and shall be binding upon the employer with respect to all returns made by him under this section until the director of the service center authorizes or directs the employer to make a return on a different basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Example.</E> Employer X is required by State law to pay his employees within 6 days after the compensation is earned. In compliance with the State law, employer X, for services rendered to him for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, pays his employees on the last-named date. June 1955 is the last month of a period for which a return of tax is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Employer X may elect to include in the return required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the period April 1 to June 30, 1955, the compensation paid to his employees for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, inclusive, although the compensation for July 1 and 2 falls within another period for which a return is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If, in this example, the payroll week ended on July 5, 1955, the compensation paid for the payroll week of June 29 to July 5 would be included in the return period in which July falls although the compensation earned for June 29 and 30 fell in a prior return period under the general rule.</P>

The return shall be made on Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.” The form to be used by residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands is Form 1040-SS, “U.S. Self-Employment Tax Return (Including Additional Child Tax Credit for Bona Fide Residents of Puerto Rico).” The form to be used by residents of Puerto Rico is either Form 1040-SS or Form 1040-PR, “Planilla para la Declaración de la Contribución Federal sobre el Trabajo por Cuenta Propia (Incluyendo el Crédito Tributario Adicional por Hijos para Residentes Bona Fide de Puerto Rico).”</P>

Every employer (or other person) notified by the IRS shall make a return for the calendar month in which the notice is received, for each of the prior calendar months in the return period, and for each calendar month afterwards (whether or not wages are paid in any such month) until the employer has filed a final return or is required to make quarterly or annual returns pursuant to notification as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

Each return made as a final return shall be marked “Final return” by the person filing the return. Every such person filing a final return (other than a final return on Form 942 or Form 943) must furnish information showing the date of the last payment of wages (as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401(a)), and, if appropriate, the date of the last payment of nonpayroll payments defined in § 31.6011(a)-4(b). An employer (other than an employer making returns on Form 942) who has only temporarily ceased to pay wages, because of seasonal activities or for other reasons, shall not make a final return but shall continue to file returns. If (i) for any return period an employer makes a final return on a particular form, and (ii) after the close of such period the employer pays wages, as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401(a), in respect of which the same or a different return form is prescribed, such employer shall make returns on the appropriate return form.

The return shall be carefully prepared so as fully and accurately to set forth the data required to be furnished therein. Returns which have not been so prepared will not be accepted as meeting the requirements of the regulations in this part. The return may be made by an agent in the name of the person required to make the return if an acceptable power of attorney is filed with the internal revenue office with which such person is required to file his returns and if such return includes all taxes required to be reported by such person on such return for the period covered by the return.

In the absence of a prescribed return form, a statement made by a taxpayer disclosing the aggregate amount of wages or compensation reportable on such form for the period in respect of which a return is required and the amount of taxes due may be accepted as a tentative return. If filed within the prescribed time, the statement so made will relieve the taxpayer from liability for the addition to tax imposed for the delinquent filing of the return, provided that without unnecessary delay such tentative return is supplemented by a return made on the proper form.

Each Form W-2 and the transmittal Form W-3 shall together constitute an information return to be filed with the Social Security Administration office indicated on the instructions to such forms. However, in the case of an employer who elects to file a composite return pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-8, the information return required by this section shall consist of magnetic tape (or other approved media) containing all information required to be on the employee statement, together with transmittal Form 4804.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Corrected returns.</E> The Social Security Administration copies of corrected Forms W-2 (or magnetic tape or other approved media) for employees for the calendar year shall be submitted with Form W-3 (or Form 4804), on or before the date on which information returns for the period in which the correction is made would be due under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of § 31.6071(a)-1, to the Social Security Administration office with which Forms W-2 are required to be filed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Statements required in case of sick pay paid by third parties.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Statements required from payor.</E> (1) Every payor of sick pay shall furnish to the employer of the payee of the sick pay a written statement. The written statement must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The name and, if there is withholding from sick pay under section 3402(o) and the regulations thereunder, the social security account number of the payee,</P>
              <P>(ii) The total amount of sick pay paid to the payee during the calendar year, and</P>

              <P>(iii) The total amount (if any) deducted and withheld from sick pay under section 3402(o) and the regulations thereunder.
              </P>
              <FP>The statement must be furnished to the employer on or before January 15 of the year following the calendar year in which any sick pay was paid.</FP>
              <P>(2) These reporting requirements are in lieu of the requirements of sections 6051(a) (relating to written statements for employees) and 6041 (relating to information returns). Statements required to be furnished by this paragraph shall be treated as statements required under section 6051 to be furnished to employees for purposes of sections 6674 (relating to fraudulent statement or failure to furnish statement to employee) and 7204 (relating to fraudulent statement or failure to make statement to employees).</P>
              <P>(3) A multiemployer plan paying sick pay pursuant to a collectively bargained agreement may furnish the statement required to be furnished by this paragraph, which shall include the total amount of sick pay paid to the employee under the plan regardless of the identity or number of employers for whom the employee worked during the calendar year under the plan, to one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The employer for whom the employee worked the most hours during the calendar year for which the statement is to be furnished,</P>
              <P>(ii) The employer for whom the employee first worked during such year,</P>
              <P>(iii) The employer for whom the employee last worked during such year,</P>
              <P>(iv) The employer for whom the employee worked immediately preceding his absence for which sick pay was paid,</P>
              <P>(v) The employer for whom the employee worked immediately following his absence for which sick pay was paid,</P>
              <P>(vi) The employer designated through the operation of a specific clause of the collective bargaining agreement, or</P>
              <P>(vii) The employer designated through the operation of a specific system of designation chosen by the payor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Information required to be furnished by employer.</E> Every employer of a payee of sick pay who receives a statement under paragraph (a) from a payor of sick pay shall furnish to each payee of sick pay a written statement, which must be furnished on Form W-2. The written statement must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) All of the information required to be furnished under paragraph (a),</P>
              <P>(2) The name, the address, and the Employer Identification Number (EIN) of the employer,</P>
              <P>(3) The words “sick pay”, which shall be written in the box labelled “Employer's use”, and</P>

              <P>(4) If any portion of the sick pay is excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3), the amount of the portion which is not so excludable and of the portion which is so excludable. Only sick pay payments includable in gross income shall be reported in the box labelled “Wages, tips, other compensation” on Form W-2. Any amount excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3) shall be reported in the box labelled “Employer's use” on Form W-2 and any amount so reported shall be described as “Nontaxable”. The information required to be furnished by this paragraph may be furnished either on the same Form W-2 that is required to be furnished under section 6051(a) or on a separate Form W-2. To the extent practicable, this statement should be furnished to the payee along with the statement (if any) required under section 6051(a) (relating to written statements for employees). The statement must be furnished to the payee on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which any sick <PRTPAGE P="354"/>pay was paid. The employer shall file copy A of Form W-2 and Form W-3 with the Social Security Administration in accordance with section 6051(d) (relating to statements to constitute information returns) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Optional rule.</E> The payor and the employer may at their option enter into an agency agreement valid under local law whereby the employer designates the payor to be the employer's agent for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this section. This agreement must specify what portion, if any, of the sick pay is excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3). If they enter into such an agreement, the payor shall not provide the statement required by paragraph (a) but shall instead furnish statements that meet all of the requirements of paragraph (b), except that the agreement must provide that the payor will furnish the statements with the payor's, rather than the employer's name, address, and Employer Identification Number (EIN) if “Sick Pay Statement Furnished under an Agency Agreement with Your Employer” appears in the box labelled “Employer's Use” on Form W-2. Paragraph (a)(2) remains applicable to statements furnished under this paragraph. In the case of sick pay paid under a multiemployer plan pursuant to a collectively bargained agreement, an amendment to either the multiemployer plan or the collectively bargained agreement designating the payor to be the employers' agent for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this section shall be deemed an agency agreement that fulfills the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the terms “payor”, “payee”, and “sick pay” shall have the same meaning as ascribed thereto in section 3402(o) and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this section, the term “employer” shall have the same meaning as ascribed thereto in section 3401(d) and the regulations thereunder, except that the term “employer” shall not include the payor for purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional requirements.</E> (1) Statements furnished to payees under this section must also comply with all requirements of section 6051 (c) and (d) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(2) The provisions of § 1.9101-1 (relating to permission to submit information required by certain returns and statements on magnetic tape) shall be applicable to the information required by this section to be furnished on Form W-2 if the employer properly complies with those provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) The provisions of section 6109 (relating to identifying numbers) and the regulations thereunder shall be applicable to Form W-2 and to any payee of sick pay to whom a statement on Form W-2 is required by this section to be furnished. Thus the employer must include the social security account number of the payee on all Forms W-2.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The provisions of this section shall apply to payments of sick pay made on or after May 1, 1981.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Transitional rule.</E> Payors may report all sick pay paid to a payee after December 31, 1980, and before May 1, 1981, on the same statement required to be furnished under paragraph (a) as is used to report sick pay paid to a payee on or after May 1, 1981. If the payor reports on the statement required to be furnished under paragraph (a), he shall not report sick pay paid after December 31, 1980, and before May 1, 1981, on Form 1099, if otherwise required to do so. If no sick pay is paid on or after May 1, 1981, the payor may report all sick pay paid to a payee after December 31, 1980, and before May 1, 1981, on the statement required to be furnished under paragraph (a). If he reports on the statement required to be furnished under paragraph (a), he shall not report sick pay paid on Form 1099, if otherwise required to do so.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement that tips be reported</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employee who receives, in the course of employment by an employer, tips that constitute wages as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401, or compensation as defined in section 3231(e), must furnish to the employer a statement, or statements, disclosing the total amount of the tips received by the employee in the course of employment by the employer. Tips received by an employee in a calendar month in the course of employment by an employer that are required to be reported to the employer must be reported on or before the 10th day of the following month. For example, tips received by an employee in January 2000 are required to be reported by the employee to the employer on or before February 10, 2000.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Statement for use in reporting tips</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The statement described in paragraph (a) of this section can be provided on paper or transmitted electronically. The statement must be signed by the employee and must disclose:</P>
              <P>(i) The name, address, and social security number of the employee.</P>
              <P>(ii) The name and address of the employer.</P>
              <P>(iii) The period for which, and the date on which, the statement is furnished. If the statement is for a period of less than 1 calendar month, the beginning and ending dates of the period must be included (for example, January 1 through January 8, 1998).</P>
              <P>(iv) The total amount of tips received by the employee during the period covered by the statement which are required to be reported to the employer (see paragraph (a) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of statement</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> No particular form is prescribed for use in furnishing the statement required by this section. The statement may be furnished on paper or transmitted electronically. An electronic system and all tip statements generated by that system must meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. If the employer does not provide any other means for the employee to report tips, the employee may use Form 4070, “Employee's Report of Tips to Employer.”</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Single-purpose forms.</E> A statement may be furnished on an employer-provided form. The form may be on paper or in electronic form. An employer that provides a paper form must make blank copies of the form readily available to all tipped employees. Any form, whether paper or electronic, provided by an employer for use by its tipped employees solely to report tips must meet all the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Regularly used forms.</E> Instead of requiring that tips be reported as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section on a special form used solely for tip reporting, an employer may prescribe regularly used forms for use by employees in reporting tips. A regularly used form may be on paper or in electronic form (such as a time card or report), must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, must contain identifying information that will ensure accurate identification of the employee by the employer, and is permitted to be used only if the employer furnishes the employee a statement suitable for retention showing the amount of tips reported by the employee for the period. The employer statement may be furnished when the employee reports the tips, when wages are first paid following the reporting of tips by the employee, or within a short time after the wages are paid. The employer may meet this requirement, for example, through the use of a payroll check stub or other payroll document regularly furnished (if not less frequent than monthly) by the employer to the employee showing gross pay and deductions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Period covered by, and due date of, tip statement</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A tip statement furnished by an employee to an employer may not cover a period greater than 1 calendar month. An employer may, however, require the submission of a statement in respect of a specified period of time, for example, on a weekly or biweekly basis, regular payroll period, etc. An employer may specify, subject to the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, the time within which, or the date on which, the statement for a specified period of time should be submitted by the employee. For example, a statement covering a payroll period may be required to be submitted on the first (or second) day following the close of the payroll period. A statement submitted by an employee after the date specified by the employer for its submission nevertheless is a statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) and this section if it is submitted to the employer on or before the 10th day following the month in which the tips were received.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Termination of employment.</E> If an employee's employment terminates, the employee must furnish a tip statement to the employer when the employee ceases to perform services for the employer. A statement submitted by an employee after the date on which <PRTPAGE P="357"/>the employee ceases to perform services for the employer is a statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) and this section if the statement is submitted to the employer on or before the earlier of the day on which the final wage payment is made by the employer to the employee or the 10th day following the month in which the tips were received.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirements for electronic systems</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The electronic system must ensure that the information received is the information transmitted by the employee and must document all occasions of access that result in the transmission of a tip statement. In addition, the design and operation of the electronic system, including access procedures, must make it reasonably certain that the person accessing the system and transmitting the statement is the employee identified in the statement transmitted.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Same information as on paper statement.</E> The electronic tip statement must provide the employer with all the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Signature.</E> The electronic tip statement must be signed by the employee. The electronic signature must identify the employee transmitting the electronic tip statement and must authenticate and verify the transmission. For this purpose, the terms <E T="03">authenticate</E> and <E T="03">verify</E> have the same meanings as they do when applied to a written signature on a paper tip statement. Any form of electronic signature that satisfies the foregoing requirements is permissible.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Copies of electronic tip statements.</E> Upon request by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the employer must supply the IRS with a hard copy of the electronic tip statement and a statement that, to the best of the employer's knowledge, the electronic tip statement was filed by the named employee. The hard copy of the electronic tip statement must provide the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but need not be a facsimile of Form 4070 or any employer-designed form.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> The record retention requirements applicable to automatic data processing systems also apply to electronic tip reporting systems.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The provisions pertaining to electronic systems and electronic tip reports are applicable as of December 13, 2000. However, employers may apply these provisions to earlier periods.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Information return by an employer with respect to tips</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employer shall file a separate information return for each calendar year (as defined in paragraph (j)(14) of this section) with respect to each large food or beverage establishment (as defined in paragraph (j)(7) of this section) in which such employer has employees. The information return shall contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The employer's name, address, and employer identification number;</P>
              <P>(ii) The establishment's name, address, and identification number (see paragraph (a)(5) of this section);</P>

              <P>(vi) The aggregate amount of tips actually received by food or beverage employees of the establishment during the calendar year and reported to the employer under section 6053(a) (see paragraph (j)(15) of this section);</P>
              <P>(vii) The aggregate amount the employer is required to report under section 6051 and the regulations thereunder with respect to service charges of less than 10 percent.</P>
              <P>(viii) The name and social security number of each employee of the establishment during the calendar year to whom an allocation was made under section 6053(c)(3) and paragraph (d) of this section and the amount of such allocation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Calendar year 1983 information return.</E> In the case of the 1983 calendar year information return, the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) through (viii) of this section shall be reported for the period beginning with the first payroll period ending on or after April 1, 1983, and ending with the end of the 1983 calendar year. See paragraph (c) of this section relating to information required for the first quarter of 1983.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Prescribed form.</E> The return required by this paragraph shall be made on Form 8027 with the transmittal form being Form 8027T. The information required by paragraph (a)(1)(viii) of this section may be provided by attaching to Form 8027 photocopies of each employee's W-2 for whom an allocation was made. A copy of any written good faith agreements applicable to a given calendar year (see paragraph (e) of this section) shall be attached to Form 8027 for such calendar year.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Time and place for filing.</E> The information return required by this paragraph (a) shall be filed on or before the last day of February (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year for which the return is made with the Internal Revenue Service Center specified by the Form 8027 or its instructions. See section 6652(a) relating to the penalty for failure to file this information return.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Large food or beverage establishment identification number.</E> Each large food or beverage establishment shall have a unique identification number to be included on Form 8027 and any employer's application pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section. If an identification number is changed for any reason, for example if the establishment becomes a different “type” of establishment as described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, or if the employer identification number changes, the employer shall notify the Service by including both the old and new identification numbers on the Form 8027 filed for the year in which the identification number was changed. An establishment identification number shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The first nine digits shall be the employer's identification number (EIN).</P>
              <P>(ii) The next digit shall identify the type of large food or beverage establishment, with the categories as follows:</P>

              <P>(A) The number “1” signifies an establishment that serves evening meals <PRTPAGE P="359"/>only (with or without alcoholic beverages).</P>
              <P>(B) The number “2” signifies an establishment that serves evening meals and other meals (with or without alcoholic beverages).</P>
              <P>(C) The number “3” signifies an establishment that serves only meals other than evening meals (with or without alcoholic beverages).</P>
              <P>(D) The number “4” signifies an establishment that serves food, if at all, as only an incidental part of the business of serving alcoholic beverages.</P>

              <P>(iii) The last five digits are to differentiate between multiple establishments reporting under the same EIN number. For this purpose, the employer shall assign each establishment reporting under such employer's EIN number a unique five digit number. For example, each establishment could be assigned a unique number by beginning with “00001” and progressing in numerical sequence (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> “00002”, “00003”, “00004”, “00005”) until each establishment has been assigned a number.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> See paragraph (j) of this section for definitions of various terms used in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Employer statement to employees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The employer shall furnish to each employee to whom an amount is allocated under section 6053(c)(3) and paragraph (d) of this section a written statement for each calendar year containing the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The employer's name and address;</P>
              <P>(ii) The name of the employee;</P>
              <P>(iii) The aggregate amount allocated to the employee for the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prescribed form.</E> The written statement required by this paragraph shall be made on Form W-2.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Time and manner for furnishing the statement.</E> The written statement required by this paragraph shall be due at the same time and shall be furnished in the same manner as the statement required to be furnished under section 6051. See section 6678 relating to the penalty for failure to file this statement.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Employee's request for an early W-2.</E> If an employee's employment is terminated prior to the end of a calendar year and the employee requests an early W-2 under section 6051 and § 31.6051-1(d), a tip allocation under section 6053(c) is not required to be shown on such early W-2. However, the employer may include on such early W-2 the employee's actual tip allocation under section 6053(c), if known, or a good faith estimate of such allocation. A good faith estimate of an allocation shall be signified by placing the word “estimate” next to the allocation on the employee's copy of the early W-2. An amended W-2 must be furnished to each employee to whom an amount is allocated under section 6053(c), during January of the calendar year following the calendar year for which the statement is made, if there is no tip allocation on the early W-2 or if the estimated allocation is found to vary from the actual allocation by more than 5 percent of the amount of the actual allocation.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Employee reporting of tip income.</E> Regardless of whether an employee receives an allocation under section 6053(c) and § 31.6053-3, the employee is required to report as income on his or her Federal income tax return all tips received. For tips received before October 1, 1985, an employee must be able to substantiate the amount of reported tip income as provided in section 6001 and the regulations thereunder, For tips received on or after October 1, 1985, an employee must be able to substantiate the amount of reported tip income as provided in § 31.6053-4. The Internal Revenue Service may determine that a tipped employee received a larger amount of tip income than is reflected by the employee's allocation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">First quarter report of 1983</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For the period beginning with the first day of calendar year 1983, and ending on the last day of the last payroll period ending before April 1, 1983, an employer must file an information return for each large food or beverage establishment that was a large food or beverage establishment on January 1, 1983, that contains the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(i)-(vii) of this section for such period.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prescribed form.</E> The information return required by this paragraph shall be made on Form 8027. The returns for the first calendar quarter of 1983 and for calendar year 1983 may be incorporated onto a single Form 8027 but <PRTPAGE P="360"/>must separately set forth the required information for each of the two return periods.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Time and place for filing.</E> The time and place for filing the information return required by this paragraph shall be the same as for the calendar year 1983 information return. See paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Allocation of excess of 8 percent of gross receipts over the aggregate amount of reported tips</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employer that operates a large food or beverage establishment shall allocate (as tips for purposes of the requirements of section 6053(c) among tipped employees at such establishment performing services during any payroll period an amount equal to the excess of:</P>
              <P>(i) Eight percent of the gross receipts (other than nonallocable receipts) of such establishment for the payroll period, over</P>
              <P>(ii) The aggregate amount of tips reported by employees at such establishment to the employer under section 6053(a) for such period. For this purpose, if an employee reports under section 6053(a) on the basis of a period other than a payroll period such employee may specify what portion of his or her reported tips are attributable to a given payroll period when reporting tips to the employer under section 6053(a). In the absence of any specification by the employee, the employer shall allocate the amount of tips reported by an employee to a given payroll period either:</P>
              <P>(A) By multiplying the aggregate amount of those reported tips by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross receipts attributable to the tipped employee for the payroll period and the denominator of which is the gross receipts attributable to the employee for the entire tip reporting period; or</P>
              <P>(B) By multiplying the aggregate amount of those reported tips by a fraction, the numerator of which is the hours worked by the employee during the payroll period and the denominator of which is the total hours worked by the employee during the entire tip reporting period.</P>
              <FP>With respect to each establishment, the employer shall choose the method described in either paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) or paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for a calendar year and apply such method consistently in making all allocations required by the preceding sentence. If an employee is employed in more than one of an employer's food or beverage operations, such employee may specify what portion of his or her reported tips are attributable to a given operation when reporting tips to the employer under section 6053(a). In the absence of any specification by the employee, the employer shall allocate the amount of tips reported by the employee to a given food or beverage operation in a manner similar to that provided above for allocation of tips among payroll periods. The employer shall choose the method described in either paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) or paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for a calendar year and apply such method consistently in making all allocations required by the preceding sentence.</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Employer not liable to employees for allocations.</E> An employer who makes allocations (as tips for purposes of the requirements of section 6053(c) and this section) among such employer's employees in accordance with paragraph (d) and either paragraph (e) or (f) of this section shall not be liable to any employee if any amount is improperly allocated. However, if an employee's total tip allocations for a calendar year as reported on Form W-2 varies from the correct allocation amount by more than 5 percent of the correct allocation amount, the employer shall adjust such employee's allocation. If such an adjustment of an employee's allocation is required, the employer shall also review all tips allocations made to other employees in the same establishment to assure that the error did not distort other allocated amounts by more than 5 percent. Any adjustments made for variances of more than 5 percent shall be reflected in amended W-2's issued to the affected employees. Tip allocations made under this section shall have no effect on the withholding responsibilities of the employer under subtitle C of the Code. Withholding on tips is authorized only with respect to amounts of tips reported to employers by employees under section 6053(a).<PRTPAGE P="361"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Allocation pursuant to a good faith agreement.</E> The amount determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for each payroll period must be allocated among tipped employees providing services during such payroll period either on the basis of a good faith agreement described in this paragraph, or, if there is no good faith agreement applicable with respect to the payroll period on the basis of the allocation method provided in paragraph (f) of this section. A good faith agreement is a written agreement consented to by the employer and at least two-thirds of the members of each occupational category of tipped employees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> waiters, busboys, maitre d's) employed in the large food or beverage establishment at the time the agreement is adopted which:</P>
              <P>(1) Provides for the allocation of the amount described in paragraph (d)(1) among tipped employees in a manner that, in combination with the tips reported by such employees under section 6053(a), will reflect a good faith approximation of the actual distribution of tip income among such tipped employees;</P>
              <P>(2) Is effective prospectively beginning with the first day of a payroll period that begins after the date of adoption, but in no event later than the first day of the succeeding calendar year. However, a good faith agreement may be effective for calendar year 1983 if adopted on or before December 31, 1983.</P>

              <P>(3) Is adopted at a time when there are tipped employees employed by the employer in each occupational category of tipped employees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> waiters, busboys, maitre d's) which would be affected by the agreement; and</P>
              <P>(4) May be revoked prospectively by a written instrumnent adopted by a least two-thirds of the tipped employees who are employed in the establishment in occupational categories affected by the agreement at the time of the revocation. A revocation of an agreement shall be effective only at the beginning of a payroll period.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Allocation method to be used in the absence of a good faith agreement.</E> (1) In a case in which there is no good faith agreement in effect and the aggregate amount of tips reported pursuant to section 6053(a) with respect to a payroll period is less than 8 percent of the establishment's gross receipts for the payroll period, the employer shall allocate the difference as tips for purposes of section 6053(c) as provided in this paragraph. No allocations shall be made to indirectly tipped employees. An allocation shall be made to each directly tipped employee performing services for the establishment who has a reporting shortfall (as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section) for the payroll period. The amount of each allocation shall be determined in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(i) Multiply the amount of the establishment's gross receipts for the payroll period by 8 percent (0.08).</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine the aggregate amount of tips reported for the payroll period by indirectly tipped employees.</P>
              <P>(iii) Subtract from the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(i) the aggregate amount of tips reported by indirectly tipped employees as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. The excess is the directly tipped employees' aggregate share of 8 percent of the gross receipts of the establishment for the payroll period.</P>

              <P>(iv) For each directly tipped employee, multiply the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of gross receipts of the establishment for the payroll period that is attributable to the employee and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of gross receipts for the payroll period that is attributable to all directly tipped employees. The product is each directly tipped employee's share of 8 percent of the gross receipts of the establishment for the payroll period. The employer may determine the fraction described in the first sentence of this subparagraph by substituting for the numerator the number of hours worked by the directly tipped employee during the payroll period and by substituting for the denominator the number of hours worked by all directly tipped employees during the payroll period. For payroll periods beginning after December 31, 1986, the method of allocation described in the preceding sentence may <PRTPAGE P="362"/>be used only by an employer that employs less than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees (as defined in paragraph (j)(19) of this section) at the establishment during the payroll period.</P>
              <P>(v) For each directly tipped employee, determine the excess, if any, of the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section over the amount reported as tips by the employee for the payroll period pursuant to section 6053(a). Such excess, if any, is the employee's shortfall for the payroll period.</P>
              <P>(vi) Subtract from the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section the aggregate amount of tips reported pursuant to section 6053(a) by all directly and indirectly tipped employees for the payroll period. The excess is the amount to be allocated as tips among directly tipped employees who had a shortfall for the payroll period as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) For each directly tipped employee who had a shortfall for the payroll period, multiply the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of such employee's shortfall (determined under paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all shortfalls for the payroll period for all directly tipped employees. The product is the employee's allocation for the payroll period.</P>

                <P>X is a large food or beverage establishment that has chosen to make tip allocations using a calendar year period. X had gross receipts for a calendar year of $2,000,000 and tips reported for the calendar year of $176,000. The amount to be allocated as tips is equal to the excess of 8 percent of the gross receipts of the establishment for the calendar year over the aggregate amount of tips reported by the employees of the establishment to the employer under section 6053(a) for the calendar year. Because the reported tips for the year ($176,000) are in excess of 8 percent of the gross receipts ($2,000,000 × .08 = $160,000), no tip allocations are made to the employees of this establishment for the calendar year.</P>

              </EXAMPLE>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Period of allocation.</E> In applying paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (h)(3) of this section an employer may substitute the calendar year or any period that results from a reasonable division of a calendar year for the term “payroll period” each place it appears in such paragraphs. If an employer makes such a substitution with respect to a large <PRTPAGE P="365"/>food or beverage establishment the substituted period shall be stated on Form 8027 for such large food or beverage establishment and shall be effective for such employer's large food or beverage establishment for the entire calendar year.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Lowering the percentage to be used</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> On and after July 18, 1984, an employer or a majority of the employees (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section) of an employer may petition the district director for the internal revenue district in which the employer's establishment is located to have the percentage of gross receipts that is used to determine the amount to be allocated under section 6053(c)(3)(A) and paragraph (d) of § 31.6053-3 reduced from 8 percent to the percentage that the petitioning employer or employees believe to be the actual percentage of the amount of the establishment's gross receipts that reflects the amount of tips. The district director may thereafter reduce the percentage of gross receipts used to determine the amount to be so allocated to the percentage that the district director determines to be the proper estimate of the actual percentage of gross receipts constituting tips. The district director, however, may not reduce the percentage below 2 percent. For the rules in effect prior to July 18, 1984, see 26 CFR 31.6053-3(h) (Rev. as of April 1, 1984).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Time and manner for petition to have percentage reduced</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The petition shall be in writing and shall include sufficient information to allow the district director to estimate with reasonable accuracy the actual tip rate of the establishment. For example, such information might include the charged tip rate, the type of establishment, menu prices, the location of the establishment, the amount of “self-service” required, the days and hours open for business, and whether the customer receives the check from or pays the server for the meal.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Employer petitions.</E> In the case of employer-originated petitions, the employer has the burden of supplying sufficient information to allow the district director to estimate with reasonable accuracy the actual tip rate of the establishment. The employer also shall attach to the petition copies of Form 8027 (if any) filed for the establishment for the 3 years preceding calendar years.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Employee petitions.</E> (A) In the case of employee-originated petitions, a majority of the employees of an establishment must consent to the petition. A majority for purposes of this paragraph is more than one-half of all the directly tipped employees (within the meaning of paragraph (j)(12) of this section) employed by the establishment at the time the petition is filed. In the case of a single petition for certain multi-establishment employers (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section), more than one-half of the aggregate directly tipped employees (at the time the petition is filed) of the establishments covered by the petition must consent. The petition filed with the district director must state the total number of directly tipped employees employed by the establishment (or establishments) and the number of the directly tipped employees consenting to the petition.</P>
              <P>(B) The petitioning employees have the burden of supplying sufficient information to allow the district director to estimate with reasonable accuracy the actual tip rate of the establishment to the extent they possess such information. If the employer possesses relevant information, the employer must provide such information to the district director upon the request of the petitioning employees or district director. Employees who file a petition under this paragraph must promptly notify their employer of the petition. Promptly upon receipt of such notification, their employer must submit to the district director copies of the Form 8027 (if any) filed for the establishment for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. Any information supplied by the employer during the petitioning process constitutes return information (as defined in section 6103(b)(2)) which shall not be disclosed by the Internal Revenue Service (except as provided in section 6103) to any employees of the employer or to representatives of such employees.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective date for reduced percentage.</E> The district director shall determine the term for which the reduced percentage is to be effective. At the <PRTPAGE P="366"/>end of such term, the reduced percentage shall cease to apply unless previously extended by the district director for the district in which the large food or beverage establishment is located. In no event shall the reduced percentage be applied to payroll periods before the date the petition described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section is filed unless the establishment is a new business (as described in paragraph (i) of § 31.6053-3). In the case of a new business or a petition for reduction filed prior to September 30, 1983, the district director may allow the approved reduced percentage to be applied retroactively to the first day of the calendar year of the petition. Until such time as the employer is notified in writing by the district director of approval of a reduction, the employer must continue to use 8 percent of gross receipts for purposes of complying with section 6053(c) and this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Single petition for certain multi-establishment employers.</E> An employer (including a single employer as defined in section 52 (a) or (b)) or a majority of the employees of such employer may use a single petition for two or more of the employer's establishments if such establishments are essentially the same type of business, the petitioning employer or employees have made a good faith determination that the tip rates at such establishments are essentially the same, and the establishments are located in the same internal revenue region. Single petitions shall include the names and locations of the establishments for which a reduction is requested and the information required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section for a typical establishment. A single petition for multi-establishments located within an internal revenue region shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the greatest number of the establishments included in the petition are located. If there is an equal number of establishments located in two or more internal revenue districts the employer or employees petitioning may choose the district to which the petition is sent.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Application of reporting requirements to new businesses</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A food or beverage operation is a new business if the employer of the operation did not operate any food or beverage operations during the preceding calendar year. An employer will not be considered to have operated a food or beverage operation during a calendar year if each food or beverage operation of the employer was operated for less than one calendar month during such year. In a calendar year in which a food or beverage operation is a new business, the determination of whether the operation is a large food or beverage establishment shall be made as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section and the employer shall comply with section 6053(c) and this section as provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of status as a large food or beverage establishment.</E> A food or beverage operation shall be considered a large food or beverage establishment during the calendar year in which it is a new business if the average number of hours worked per business day by all employees of the employer at the new business during each of any two consecutive calendar months of the calendar year, computed in the manner provided in the second sentence of paragraph (j)(9) of this section, is greater than 80 hours.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">New business compliance under section 6053(c).</E> A new business that is determined to be a large food or beverage establishment under paragraph (i)(2) of this section shall comply with section 6053(c) and this section beginning with the first payroll period that begins after the first period of two consecutive calendar months described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of section 6053(c) and this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Gross receipts.</E> Gross receipts shall include all receipts (other than nonallocable receipts), from the provision of food or beverages by a large food or beverage establishment from cash sales, charge receipts (including charged tips only to the extent the cash sales amount has been reduced due to the employer paying cash to tipped employees for charged tips due them), charges to a hotel room (excluding tips charged to a hotel room only to the extent that the employer's accounting procedures allow such tips to be segregated out and excluding <PRTPAGE P="367"/>charges that are otherwise included in charge receipts), and the retail value of complimentary food or beverages (as defined in paragraph (j)(16) of this section) served to customers. Gross receipts shall not include state or local taxes. In the case of a trade or business that does not charge separately for the provision of food or beverages (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a trade or business that provides other goods or services along with food or beverages for a combined price, such as a “package deal” for food and lodging), the employer shall make a good faith estimate of the gross receipts attributable to the provision of the food or beverages that reflects the cost to the employer of providing the food or beverages plus a reasonable profit factor.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Gross receipts attributable to a directly tipped employee.</E> Gross receipts attributable to a directly tipped employee are those gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) from the provision of food or beverages to customers with respect to which the employee provided services. For example, if a directly tipped employee's name is on every check given to customers for whom the employee has provided services, the gross receipts attributable to such employee could be determined by aggregating the amounts of all checks bearing that employee's name (other than amounts from nonallocable receipts).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Nonallocable receipts.</E> Nonallocable receipts are receipts which are attributable to carryout sales or to services with respect to which a service charge of 10 percent or more is added. Carryout sales are sales of food or beverages for consumption off the premises of the establishment. Room service is not a carryout sale. If an establishment's accounting system does not segregate receipts from carryout sales from the establishment's other receipts, receipts from carryout sales may be determined as an estimated percentage of total receipts. The applicable percentage shall be determined in good faith by the employer on the basis of generally accepted accounting practices, including but not limited to, surveys of carryout sales as a percentage of gross sales. An employer may rely upon estimates as to carryout sales which are established in good faith between the employer and state or local governments for purposes of state or local taxation.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Charge receipts.</E> Charge receipts shall include credit card charges and charges under any other credit arrangement (e.g., house charges, city ledger, and charge arrangements to country club members). Charges to a hotel room may be excluded from charge receipts if such exclusion is consistent with the employer's normal accounting practices and the employer applies such exclusion consistently for a given large food or beverage establishment. Otherwise, charges to a hotel room shall be included in charge receipts.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Charged tips.</E> A tip included on a charge receipt is a charged tip.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Food or beverage operation.</E> A “food or beverage operation” is any business activity which provides food or beverages for consumption on the premises (other than “fast food” operations). If an employer conducts activities that provide food or beverages at more than one location, the activity at each separate location shall be considered to be a separate food or beverage operation, Each activity conducted within a single building shall be considered to be conducted at a separate location if the customers of the activity, while being provided with food or beverages, occupy an area separate from that occupied by customers of other activities and the gross receipts of the activity are recorded separately from the gross receipts of other activities. For example, a gourmet restaurant, a coffee shop, and a cocktail lounge in a hotel would each be treated as a separate food or beverage operation if gross receipts from each activity are recorded separately. In addition, an employer may treat different activities conducted in the identical place at different times as separate food or beverage operations if the gross receipts of the activities at each time are recorded separately. For example, a restaurant may record the gross receipts from its cafeteria style lunch operation separately from the gross receipts of its full service food or beverage operations.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Large food or beverage establishment.</E> A food or beverage operation is a “large food or beverage establishment” if:<PRTPAGE P="368"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The employer at the food or beverage operation normally employed more than 10 employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The tipping of food or beverage employees of the food or beverage operation is customary. Generally, tipping would not be considered customary for a cafeteria style operation (as defined in paragraph (j)(18) of this section) or for a food or beverage operation where at least 95 percent of its total sales are nonallocable receipts, within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3) of this section, by reason of the addition of a service charge of 10 percent or more. Total sales shall include only gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) and nonallocable receipts (other than carryout receipts) from the provision of food or beverages. In the case of an operation such as a restaurant that is a cafeteria style operation at lunch and that has full service with tipping customary at dinner, the entire operation is generally a large food or beverage establishment if the employer meets the 10-employee test. However, if the gross receipts of the cafeteria style operation at lunch are recorded separately from the dinner operation gross receipts the employer may treat the dinner operation as a large food or beverage establishment and the lunch operation as a separate food or beverage operation that is not a large food or beverage establishment due to the fact that tipping is not considered customary for cafeteria style operations.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Employee.</E> The term “employee” has the same meaning as in section 3401(c) and § 31.3401(c)-1.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">More than 10 employees on a typical business day.</E> An employer shall be considered to have normally employed more than 10 employees on a typical business day during a calendar year if one-half of the sum of the average number of employee hours worked per business day during the calendar month in which the aggregate gross receipts from food or beverage operations were the greatest plus the average number of employee hours worked per business day during the calendar month in which the aggregate gross receipts from food or beverage operations were the least, is greater than 80 hours. The average number of employee hours worked per business day during a month shall be computed by dividing the total number of hours worked during the month by all employees of the employer who are employed in a food or beverage operation by the average of the number of days during the month that each food or beverage operation at which such employees worked was open for business. If an employer operates both a food or beverage operation and a nonfood or beverage operation, and one or more of his or her employees work for both operations, the employer may make a good faith estimate of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given month. Similarly, in cases where one or more of an employer's employees work for more than one of such employer's food or beverage operations, a good faith estimate may be made of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given month. For purposes of this subparagraph, employees who are employed in a food or beverage operation include all employees of the operation, not just food or beverage employees. The employees of an employer shall include all employees at all food or beverage operations who, along with the employees of such employer, would be treated as employees of a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) (as in effect on September 3, 1982) and the regulations thereunder. For example, if an employer at a food or beverage operation is a member of a controlled group of corporations, then all employees of all corporations which are members of such controlled group of corporations shall be treated as employed by each such employer for purposes of this paragraph. However, an individual who owns 50 percent or more in value of the stock of a corporation operating an establishment shall not be treated as an employee of any establishment owned by the corporation.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Food or beverage employee.</E> A “food or beverage employee” is an employee who provides services in connection with the provision of food or beverages. Such employees include, but are not limited to, waiters, waitresses, busboys, bartenders, persons in charge of seating (such as a hostess, maitre d' <PRTPAGE P="369"/>or dining room captain), wine stewards, cooks, and kitchen help. Examples of employees who are not food or beverage employees include, but are not limited to, coat check persons, bellhops, and doormen.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Tipped employee.</E> A “tipped employee” of a food or beverage operation is an employee who is a food or beverage employee that customarily receives tip income from employment at that operation. An employee who occasionally receives small amounts of tip income is not a tipped employee. Generally, an employee who receives less than $20 per month in tip income would not be considered as customarily receiving tip income.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Directly tipped employee.</E> A “directly tipped employee” is any tipped employee who receives tips directly from customers, including an employee who after receiving tips directly from customers turns all the tips over to a tip pool. Examples of directly tipped employees are waiters, waitresses, and bartenders.</P>
              <P>(13) <E T="03">Indirectly tipped employee.</E> An “indirectly tipped employee” is a tipped employee who does not normally receive tips directly from customers. Examples of indirectly tipped employees are busboys, service bartenders and cooks. An employee, such as a maitre d', who receives tips both directly from customers and indirectly through tip splitting or tip pooling shall be treated as a directly tipped employee.</P>
              <P>(14) <E T="03">Calendar year.</E> The term “calendar year” shall mean either the period from January 1 through December 31 or the period that begins with the first day of the first payroll period ending on or after January 1 and ends with the last day of the last payroll period ending in December of the same year. With respect to any establishment, the employer shall choose one of these two descriptions and apply it consistently.</P>
              <P>(15) <E T="03">Tips reported for a specified period.</E> Tips reported to an employer for a specified period under section 6053(a) are those tips actually received by an employee during such period without regard to the time when the tips are reported to the employer. Thus, if an employee reports to the employer in calendar year 1984 tips the employee actually received in calendar year 1983, the amount of tips actually received in calendar year 1983 must be included by the employer when making such information returns, statements and allocations required under section 6053(c) and this section for calendar year 1983.</P>
              <P>(16) <E T="03">Complimentary food or beverages.</E> Food or beverages served to customers without charge are complimentary if:</P>
              <P>(i) Tipping for the provision of such food or beverages is customary at the establishment, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Such food or beverages are provided in connection with an activity that is engaged in for profit and whose receipts would not be included in gross receipts as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section but for this subparagraph and are not nonallocable receipts which are attributable to services with respect to which a service charge of 10 percent or more is added.</P>
              <FP>For example, the retail values of complimentary hors d'oeuvres served at a bar or a complimentary dessert served to a regular patron of a restaurant would not be included in gross receipts because the receipts of the bar or restaurant would be included in gross receipts as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The retail value of a complimentary fruit basket placed in a hotel room generally would not be included in gross receipts because tipping for the provision of such items is not customary. The retail value of complimentary drinks served to customers in a gambling casino would be included in gross receipts because tipping for the provision of such items is customary, the gambling casino is an activity engaged in for profit, and the gambling receipts of the casino would not be included in gross receipts as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section except for this subparagraph.</FP>
              <P>(17) <E T="03">Fast food operation.</E> An operation is a “fast food” operation only if its customers order, pick up, and pay for food or beverages at a counter, window, etc., and then carry the food or beverages to another location (either on or off the premises of such activities).</P>
              <P>(18) <E T="03">Cafeteria style operation.</E> The term “cafeteria style” operation means a food or beverage operation which is primarily self-service and in which the total cost of food or beverages selected <PRTPAGE P="370"/>by a customer is paid prior to the customer's being seated or is stated on a check provided to the customer prior to the customer's being seated and is paid by the customer to a cashier. Generally, operations are primarily self-service if food or beverages are ordered or selected by a customer at one location and carried by the customer from such location to the customer's seat. For example, cafeteria lines, buffets, and smorgasbords are primarily self-service. If, after a customer is seated, a food or beverage employee delivers items such as an item that required additional preparation after being selected by the customer, condiments, beverages, or refills at no additional cost to the customer, a food or beverage operation's status as primarily self-service would not be affected.</P>
              <P>(19) <E T="03">Less than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees.</E> For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, an employer shall be considered to employ less than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees at an establishment during a payroll period (as defined in section 3401(b) and the regulations thereunder) if the average number of employee hours worked per business day during a payroll period is less than 200 hours. The average number of employee hours worked per business day during a payroll period shall be computed by dividing the total number of hours worked during the period by all employees of the employer who are employed in a food or beverage operation by the average of the number of days during the period that each food or beverage operation at which such employees worked was open for business. If an employer operates both a food or beverage operation and a nonfood or beverage operation, and one or more of his employees work for both operations, the employer may make a good faith estimate of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given payroll period. Similarly, in cases where one or more of an employer's employees work for more than one of such employer's food or beverage operations, a good faith estimate may be made of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given payroll period. If there is more than one payroll period for the establishment, the payroll period which is used for the greatest number of employees shall be the payroll period for purposes of this paragraph (j)(19). For purposes of this paragraph (j)(19), employees who are employed in a food or beverage operation include all employees of the operation, not just food or beverage employees. The employees of an employer shall include all employees at all food or beverage operations who, along with the employees of such employer, would be treated as employees of a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) (as in effect on September 3, 1982) and the regulations thereunder. For example, if an employer at a food or beverage operation is a member of a controlled group of corporations, then all employees of all corporations which are members of such controlled group of corporations shall be treated as employed by each such employer for purposes of this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(l) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> An employer shall keep records sufficient to substantiate any information returns, employer statements to employees, applications, or tip allocations made pursuant to section 6053(c) and this section. The records required by this paragraph shall be retained for 3 years after the due date of the return or statement to which they pertain.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Substantiation requirements for tipped employees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Substantiation of tip income</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employee shall maintain sufficient evidence to establish the amount of tip income received by the employee during a taxable year. A daily record maintained by the employee (as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) shall constitute sufficient evidence. If the employee does not maintain a daily record, other evidence of the amount of tip income received during the year, such as documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), shall constitute sufficient evidence, but only if such other evidence is as credible and as reliable as a daily record. The Commissioner may by revenue ruling, procedure or other guidance of general applicability provide for other methods of demonstrating evidence of tip income. However, notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (a) (1), a daily record or other evidence that is as credible and as reliable as a daily record may not be sufficient evidence if there are facts or circumstances which indicate that the employee received a larger amount of tip income. Moreover, oral statements of the employee, without corroboration, cannot constitute sufficient evidence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Daily record.</E> The daily record shall state the employee's name and address, the employer's name, and the establishment's name. The daily record shall show for each work day the amount of cash tips and charge tips received directly from customers or from other employees, and the amount of tips, if any, paid out to other employees through tip sharing, tip pooling or other arrangements and the names of such employees. The record shall also show the date that each entry is made. Form 4070A, <E T="03">Employee's Daily Record of Tips,</E> may be used to maintain such daily record. In addition, an electronic system maintained by the employer that collects substantially similar information as Form 4070A may be used to maintain such daily record, provided the employee receives and maintains a paper copy of the daily record. The daily record of tips received by an employee shall be prepared and maintained in such manner that each entry is made on or near the date the tip income is received. A daily record made on or near the date the tip income is received has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a record prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall. An entry is made “near the date the tip income is received” if the required information with respect to tips received and paid out by the employee for the day is recorded at a time when the employee has full present knowledge of those receipts and payments.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Documentary evidence.</E> Documentary evidence consists of copies of any documents that contain (i) amounts that were added to a check by customers as a tip and paid over to the employee or (ii) amounts that were paid by a customer for food or beverages with respect to which tips generally would be received by the employee. Examples of documentary evidence are copies of restaurant bills, credit card charges, or charges under any other arrangement (see § 31.6053-3(j)(4)) containing amounts added by the customer as a tip.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Retention of records.</E> Records maintained under this section shall be kept at all times available for inspection by authorized internal revenue officers or employees, and shall be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The substantiation requirements of this § 31.6053-4 shall be effective for tips received on or after October 1, 1985. For the rules in effect prior to October 1, 1985, see section 6001 and the regulations thereunder. Substantiation considered sufficient as provided in this § 31.6053-4 will also be considered sufficient for tips received before October 1, 1985.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) An employer who has underreported and underpaid employee Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under section 3101 or <PRTPAGE P="377"/>employer FICA tax under section 3111, employee Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) tax under section 3201 or employer RRTA tax under section 3221, or income tax required under section 3402 to be withheld, with respect to any payment of wages or compensation, shall correct such error as provided in this section. Such correction may constitute an interest-free adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) No correction will be eligible for interest-free adjustment treatment if the failure to report relates to an issue that was raised in an examination of a prior return period or if the employer knowingly underreported its employment tax liability.</P>
              <P>(3) Every correction under this section of an underpayment of tax with respect to a payment of wages or compensation shall be made on the form prescribed by the IRS that corresponds to the return being corrected. The form, filed in accordance with this section and the instructions, will constitute an adjusted return for the return period being corrected.</P>
              <P>(4) Every adjusted return on which an underpayment is corrected pursuant to this section shall designate the return period in which the error was ascertained and the return period being corrected, explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support the correction, and set forth such other information as may be required by the regulations in this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return.</P>
              <P>(5) For purposes of this section, an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.</P>
              <P>(6) No correction will be eligible for interest-free adjustment treatment pursuant to this section after the earlier of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Receipt from the IRS of notice and demand for payment thereof based upon an assessment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Receipt from the IRS of a Notice of Determination of Worker Classification (Notice of Determination) in connection with such underpayment. Prior to receipt of a Notice of Determination, the taxpayer may, in lieu of making a payment, make a cash bond deposit that would have the effect of stopping the accrual of any interest, but would not deprive the taxpayer of its right to receive a Notice of Determination and to petition the Tax Court under section 7436.</P>
              <P>(7) Subject to the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(6) of this section, Form 2504, “Agreement and Collection of Additional Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment (Excise or Employment Tax),” Form 2504-WC, “Agreement to Assessment and Collection of Additional Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment in Worker Classification Cases (Employment Tax),” and such other forms as may be prescribed by the IRS, constitute adjusted returns for purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) For provisions related to furnishing employee statements and corrected employee statements reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-1. For provisions relating to filing information returns and corrected information returns reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-2.</P>
              <P>(9) For the period of limitations upon assessment and collection of taxes, see § 301.6501(a)-1.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act</E>—(1) <E T="03">Undercollection ascertained before return is filed.</E> If an employer collects less than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax from an employee with respect to a payment of wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the employee tax with respect to such wages or compensation is required to be reported, the employer shall nevertheless report on the return and pay to the IRS the correct amount of employee tax. If the employer does not report the correct amount of tax in these circumstances, the employer may not later correct the error through an interest-free adjustment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Error ascertained after return is filed.</E> (i) If an employer files a return on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is required to be reported, and reports on the return less than the correct amount of employee or employer FICA or RRTA tax with respect to a payment <PRTPAGE P="378"/>of wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for Additional Medicare Tax. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of tax by reporting the additional amount due on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation was paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the underpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed within the period of limitations for assessment for the return period being corrected, and by the due date for filing the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the adjusted return is filed. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).</P>
              <P>(ii) If an employer files a return reporting FICA tax for a return period although the employer was required to file a return reporting RRTA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. However, if the employer also reported less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax, the employer shall correct the underwithheld and underpaid Additional Medicare Tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of RRTA tax by reporting the correct amount of RRTA tax on an original return for reporting RRTA tax for the return period for which the incorrect return was filed, accompanied by an adjusted return corresponding to the incorrect return that was filed to correct the erroneously reported and paid FICA tax. The adjusted return must include a detailed explanation of the amounts being reported on the original return and the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by the regulations in this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the correct amounts for the period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the returns are filed by the due date of the return for reporting the RRTA tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. Pursuant to § 31.3503-1, the amount of erroneously paid FICA tax will be credited against the underpaid RRTA tax. Any remaining underpayment of RRTA tax adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the remaining underpayment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).</P>

              <P>(iii) If an employer files a return reporting RRTA tax for a return period although the employer was required to file a return reporting FICA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. However, if the employer also reported less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax, the employer shall correct the underwithheld and underpaid Additional Medicare Tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of FICA tax by reporting the correct amount of FICA tax on an original return for reporting FICA tax for the return period for <PRTPAGE P="379"/>which the incorrect return was filed (or an adjusted return for reporting the FICA tax if an original return was already filed for such return period to report the income tax required to be withheld under section 3402), accompanied by an adjusted return corresponding to the incorrect return that was filed to correct the erroneously reported and paid RRTA tax. The adjusted return(s) must include a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the original return and/or the adjusted return(s) and any other information as may be required by the regulations in this section and by the instructions relating to the form. The reporting of the correct amounts for the period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the returns are filed by the due date of the return for reporting the FICA tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. Pursuant to § 31.3503-1, the amount of erroneously paid RRTA tax will be credited against the underpaid FICA tax. Any remaining underpayment of FICA tax adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2)(iii). If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the remaining underpayment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Return not filed because of failure to treat individual as employee.</E> If an employer fails to file a return for a return period solely because the employer failed to treat any individuals properly as employees for the return period (and, therefore, failed to withhold and pay any employer or employee FICA or RRTA tax with respect to wages or compensation paid to the employees) and if the employer ascertains the error after the due date of the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall report the amount due by filing an original return required to be filed to report the tax for the return period for which the employer failed to file a return, accompanied by an adjusted return as provided in the instructions to the adjusted return. The adjusted return must include a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the original return and adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the correct amount of tax for the return period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the original and adjusted returns are filed by the due date of the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. However, an adjustment of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) may only be reported pursuant to this section if the error is ascertained within the same calendar year that the wages or compensation were paid to the employee, or if section 3509 applies to determine the amount of the underpayment, or if the adjustment is reported on a Form 2504 or Form 2504-WC. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Additional Medicare Tax.</E> If an employer files a return on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is required to be reported, and reports on the return less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld with respect to a payment of wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. An adjustment <PRTPAGE P="380"/>of Additional Medicare Tax may only be reported pursuant to this paragraph (b)(4) if the error is ascertained within the same calendar year that the wages or compensation were paid to the employee, unless the underpayment is attributable to an administrative error (that is, an error involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount actually withheld), section 3509 applies to determine the amount of the underpayment, or the adjustment is reported on a Form 2504 or Form 2504-WC. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of Additional Medicare Tax by reporting the additional amount due on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation were paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the underpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed within the period of limitations for assessment for the return period being corrected, and by the due date for filing the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the adjusted return is filed. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Income tax required to be withheld from wages</E>—(1) <E T="03">Undercollection ascertained before return is filed.</E> If an employer collects less than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld from wages under section 3402, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the withheld tax is required to be reported, the employer shall nevertheless report on the return and pay to the IRS the correct amount of tax required to be withheld. If the employer does not report the correct amount of tax in these circumstances, the employer may not correct the error through an interest-free adjustment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Error ascertained after return is filed.</E> If an employer files a return on which income tax required to be withheld from wages is required to be reported and reports on the return less than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of tax by reporting the additional amount due on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages were paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the underpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed by the due date for filing the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. However, an adjustment may only be reported pursuant to this section if the error is ascertained within the same calendar year that the wages to the employee were paid, unless the underpayment is attributable to an administrative error (that is, an <PRTPAGE P="381"/>error involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount actually withheld), section 3509 applies to determine the amount of the underpayment, or the adjustment is reported on a Form 2504 or Form 2504-WC. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the adjusted return is filed. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Return not filed because of failure to treat individual as employee.</E> If an employer fails to file a return for a return period solely because the employer failed to treat any individuals properly as employees for the return period (and, therefore, failed to withhold and pay any income tax required to be withheld from wages), the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall report the amount due by filing an original return for the return period for which the employer failed to file a return, accompanied by an adjusted return as provided in the instructions to the adjusted return. The adjusted return must include a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the original and adjusted returns and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the correct amount of tax for the return period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the original and adjusted returns are filed by the due date of the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements.

The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Deductions from employee</E>—(1) <E T="03">Federal Insurance Contributions Tax Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act.</E> If an employer collects less than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax from an employee with respect to a payment of wages or compensation, the employer must collect the amount of the undercollection by deducting the amount from remuneration of the employee, if any, paid after the employer ascertains the error. If an employer collects less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a), the employer must collect the amount of the undercollection on or before the last day of the calendar year by deducting the amount from remuneration of the employee, if any, paid after the employer ascertains the error. Such deductions may be made even though the remuneration, for any reason, does not constitute wages or compensation. The correct amount of employee tax must be reported and paid, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whether or not the undercollection is corrected by a deduction made as prescribed in this paragraph (d)(1), and even if the deduction is made after the return on which the employee tax must be reported is due. If such a deduction is not made, the obligation of the employee to the employer with respect to the undercollection is a matter for settlement between the employee and the employer. If an employer makes an erroneous collection of employee tax from <PRTPAGE P="382"/>two or more of its employees, a separate settlement must be made with respect to each employee. An overcollection of employee tax from one employee may not be used to offset an undercollection of such tax from another employee. For provisions relating to the employer's liability for the tax, whether or not it collects the tax from the employee, see §§ 31.3102-1(d), 31.3102-4(c), and 31.3202-1. This paragraph (d)(1) does not apply if section 3509 applies to determine the employer's liability.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Income tax required to be withheld from wages.</E> If an employer collects less than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld from wages during a calendar year, the employer must collect the amount of the undercollection on or before the last day of the year by deducting the amount from remuneration of the employee, if any, paid after the employer ascertains the error. Such deductions may be made even though the remuneration, for any reason, does not constitute wages. The correct amount of income tax must be reported and paid, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, whether or not the undercollection is corrected by a deduction made as prescribed in this paragraph (d)(2), and even if the deduction is made after the return on which the tax must be reported is due. If such a deduction is not made, the obligation of the employee to the employer with respect to the undercollection is a matter for settlement between the employee and the employer within the calendar year. If an employer makes an erroneous collection of income tax from two or more of its employees, a separate settlement must be made with respect to each employee. An overcollection of income tax from one employee may not be used to offset an undercollection of such tax from another employee. For provisions relating to the employer's liability for the tax, whether or not it collects the tax from the employee, see § 31.3403-1. For provisions relating to the employer's liability for an underpayment of tax unless the employer can show that the income tax against which the tax under section 3402 may be credited has been paid, see § 31.3402(d)-1.

                <P>A State or local government employer should have withheld and paid $100 dollars in hospital insurance taxes for the quarter beginning April 1, 1986, and ending June 30, 1986.

              <SUBJECT>Deposit rules for taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and withheld income taxes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> With respect to employment taxes attributable to payments made after December 31, 1992, an employer is either a monthly depositor or a semi-weekly depositor based on an annual determination. An employer must generally deposit employment taxes under one of two rules: the Monthly rule in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the Semi-Weekly rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Various exceptions and safe harbors are provided. Paragraph (f) of this section provides certain safe harbors for employers who inadvertently fail to deposit the full amount of taxes. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides an overriding exception to the Monthly and Semi-Weekly rules where an employer has accumulated $100,000 or more of employment taxes. Paragraph (e) of this section provides the definition of employment taxes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of status</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The determination of whether an employer is a monthly or semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year is based on an annual determination and generally depends upon the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported by the employer for the lookback period as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Monthly depositor</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employer is a monthly depositor for the entire calendar year if the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period is $50,000 or less.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Special rule.</E> An employer ceases to be a monthly depositor on the first day after the employer is subject to the One-Day ($100,000) rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. At that time, the employer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor for the remainder of the calendar year and for the following calendar year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Semi-weekly depositor.</E> An employer is a semi-weekly depositor for the entire calendar year if the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period exceeds $50,000.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Lookback period</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> For employers who file Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,” (or any related Spanish-language returns or returns for U.S. possessions) the lookback period for each calendar year is the twelve month period ended the preceding June 30. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 2006 is the period July 1, 2004, to June 30, 2005. The lookback period for employers who file Form 944, “Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,” or filed Form 944 (or any related Spanish-language returns or returns for U.S. possessions) for either of the two previous calendar years, is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 2006 is calendar year 2004. In determining status as either a monthly or semi-weekly depositor, an employer should determine the aggregate amount of employment tax liabilities reported on its return(s) (Forms 941 or Form 944) for the lookback period. The amount of employment tax liabilities reported for the lookback period is the amount the employer reported on either Forms 941 or Form 944 even if the employer is required to file the other form for the current calendar year. New employers shall be treated as having employment tax liabilities of zero for any part of the lookback period before the date the employer started or acquired its business.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adjustments and claims for refund.</E> The employment tax liability reported on the original return for the return period is the amount taken into account in determining whether the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period exceeds $50,000. Any amounts reported on adjusted returns or claims for refund pursuant to sections 6205, 6402, 6413, and 6414 filed after the due date of the original return are not taken into account when determining the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period. Prior period adjustments reported on Forms 941 or Form 944 for 2008 and earlier years are taken into account in determining the employment tax liability for the return period in which the adjustments are reported.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Deposit rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Monthly rule.</E> An employer that is a monthly depositor <PRTPAGE P="385"/>must deposit employment taxes accumulated with respect to payments made during a calendar month by electronic funds transfer by the 15th day of the following month. If the 15th day of the following month is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia under section 7503, taxes will be treated as timely deposited if deposited on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Semi-Weekly rule</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employer that is a semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year must deposit employment taxes by electronic funds transfer by the dates set forth below:</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Semi-weekly period spanning two return periods.</E> If the return period ends during a semi-weekly period in which an employer has two or more payment dates, two deposit obligations may exist. For example, if one quarterly return period ends on Thursday and a new quarterly return period begins on Friday, employment taxes from payments on Wednesday and Thursday are subject to one deposit obligation, and employment taxes from payments on Friday are subject to a separate deposit obligation. Two separate federal tax deposits are required.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Special rule for computing days.</E> Semi-weekly depositors have at least three business days following the close of the semi-weekly period by which to deposit employment taxes accumulated during the semi-weekly period. Business days include every calendar day other than Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays in the District of Columbia under section 7503. If any of the three weekdays following the close of a semi-weekly period is a legal holiday, the employer has an additional day for each day that is a legal holiday by which to make the required deposit. For example, if the Monday following the close of a Wednesday to Friday semi-weekly period is Memorial Day, a legal holiday, the required deposit for the semi-weekly period is not due until the following Thursday rather than the following Wednesday.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exception—One-Day rule.</E> Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, if on any day within a deposit period (monthly or semi-weekly) an employer has accumulated $100,000 or more of employment taxes, those taxes must be deposited by electronic funds transfer in time to satisfy the tax obligation by the close of the next day. If the next day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia under section 7503, the taxes will be treated as timely deposited if deposited on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of determining whether the $100,000 threshold is met—</P>
              <P>(i) A monthly depositor takes into account only those employment taxes accumulated in the calendar month in which the day occurs; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A semi-weekly depositor takes into account only those employment taxes accumulated in the Wednesday-Friday or Saturday-Tuesday semi-weekly period in which the day occurs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Deposits required only on business days.</E> No taxes are required to be deposited under this section on any day that is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Deposits are required only on business days. Business days include every calendar day other than Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays. For purposes of this paragraph (c), legal holidays shall have the same meaning provided in section 7503. Pursuant to section 7503, the term <E T="03">legal holiday</E> means a legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term “legal holiday” does not include other Statewide legal holidays.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Exception to the monthly and semi-weekly deposit rules for employers in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944).</E> Generally, an employer who files Form 944 for a taxable year may remit its accumulated employment taxes with its timely filed return for <PRTPAGE P="386"/>that taxable year and is not required to deposit under either the monthly or semi-weekly rules set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section during that taxable year. An employer who files Form 944 whose actual employment tax liability exceeds the eligibility threshold, as set forth in §§ 31.6011(a)-1(a)(5) and 31.6011(a)-4(a)(4), will not qualify for this exception and should follow the deposit rules set forth in this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Extension of time to deposit for employers in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) during the preceding year.</E> An employer who filed Form 944 for the preceding year but will file Form 941 instead for the current year will be deemed to have timely deposited its current year's January deposit obligation(s) under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section if the employer deposits the amount of such deposit obligation(s) by March 15 of that year.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Exception to the monthly and semi-weekly deposit rules for employers making interest-free adjustments.</E> An employer filing an adjusted return under § 31.6205-1 to report taxes that were accumulated in a prior return period shall pay the amount of the adjustment by the time it files the adjusted return, and the amount timely paid will be deemed to have been timely deposited by the employer. The payment may be made by a check or money order with the adjusted return, by electronic funds transfer, or by other methods of payment as provided by the instructions relating to the adjusted return.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1 Monthly depositor.</HD>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Determination of status.</E> For calendar year 2011, Employer A determines its depositor status using the lookback period July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010. For the four calendar quarters within this period, A reported aggregate employment tax liabilities of $42,000 on its quarterly Forms 941. Because the aggregate amount did not exceed $50,000, A is a monthly depositor for the entire calendar year 2011.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Monthly rule.</E> During December 2011, A (a monthly depositor) accumulates $3,500 in employment taxes. A has a $3,500 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the 15th day of the following month. Since January 15, 2012, is a Sunday, and January 16, 2012, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, is a legal holiday, A's deposit obligation will be satisfied if the deposit is made by electronic funds transfer by the next business day, January 17, 2012.</P>

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Determination of status.</E> For the calendar year 2011, Employer B determines its depositor status using the lookback period July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010. For the four calendar quarters within this period, B reported aggregate employment tax liabilities of $88,000 on its quarterly Forms 941. Because that amount exceeds $50,000, B is a semi-weekly depositor for the entire calendar year 2011.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Semi-weekly rule.</E> On Friday, January 7, 2011, B (a semi-weekly depositor) has a pay day on which it accumulates $4,000 in employment taxes. B has a $4,000 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the following Wednesday, January 12, 2011.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Deposit made within three business days.</E> On Friday, January 14, 2011, B (a semi-weekly depositor) has a pay day on which it accumulates $4,200 in employment taxes. Generally, B would have a required deposit obligation of employment taxes that must be satisfied by the following Wednesday, January 19, 2011. Because Monday, January 17, 2011, is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, a legal holiday, B has an additional day to make the required deposit. B has a $4,200 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the following Thursday, January 20, 2011.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 6 Extension of time to deposit for employers who filed Form 944 for the preceding year satisfied.</HD>
                <P>F (a monthly depositor) was notified to file Form 944 to report its employment tax liabilities for the 2006 calendar year. F filed Form 944 on January 31, 2007, reporting a total employment tax liability for 2006 of $3,000. Because F's annual employment tax liability for the 2006 taxable year exceeded $1,000 (the applicable eligibility threshold for that taxable year), the IRS notified F to file Forms 941 for calendar year 2007 and thereafter. Based on F's liability during the lookback period (calendar year 2005, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section), F is a monthly depositor for 2007. F accumulates $1,000 in employment taxes during January 2007. Because F is a monthly depositor, F's January deposit obligation is due February 15, 2007. F does not deposit these accumulated employment taxes on February 15, 2007. F accumulates $1,500 in employment taxes during February 2007. F's February deposit is due March 15, 2007. F deposits the $2,500 of employment taxes accumulated during January and February on March 15, 2007. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section, F will be deemed to have timely deposited the employment taxes due for January 2007, and, thus, the IRS will not impose a failure-to-deposit penalty under section 6656 for that month.</P>

In the case of employers paying advance earned income credit amounts for periods ending before January 1, 2011, the amount of taxes required to be deposited shall be reduced by advance amounts paid to employees. Also, see § 31.6302-3 concerning a taxpayer's option with respect to payments made before January 1, 1994, to treat backup withholding amounts under section 3406 separately.</P>

In the first quarter of 2006, K accumulates employment taxes in the amount of $1,000. On April 28, 2006, K deposits the $1,000 of employment taxes accumulated in the first quarter. K accumulates another $1,000 of employment taxes during the second quarter of 2006. On July 31, 2006, K deposits the $1,000 of employment taxes accumulated in the second quarter. K's business grows and accumulates $1,500 in employment taxes during the third quarter of 2006. On October 31, 2006, K deposits the $1,500 of employment taxes accumulated in the third quarter. K accumulates another $2,000 in employment taxes during the fourth quarter. K files Form 944 on January 31, 2007, reporting a total employment tax liability for 2006 of $5,500 and submits a check for the remaining $2,000 of employment taxes with the return. K will be deemed to have timely deposited the employment taxes due for all of 2006 because K complied with the <E T="03">de minimis</E> deposit rule provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section. Therefore, the IRS will not impose a failure-to-deposit penalty under section 6656 for any month of the year. Under this <E T="03">de minimis</E> deposit rule, because K was required to file Form 944 for calendar year 2006, if K's employment tax liability for a quarter is <E T="03">de minimis,</E> then K may deposit that quarter's liability by the last day of the month following the close of the quarter. This <E T="03">de minimis</E> rule allows K to have the benefit of the same quarterly <E T="03">de minimis</E> amount K would have received if K filed Form 941 each quarter instead of Form 944 annually. Thus, because K's employment tax liability for each quarter was <E T="03">de minimis,</E> K could deposit quarterly.</P>

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Agricultural employers—special rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An agricultural employer reports wages paid to farm workers annually on Form 943 (Employer's Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Employees) and reports wages paid to nonfarm workers quarterly on Form 941 or annually on Form 944. Accordingly, an agricultural employer must treat employment taxes reportable on Form 943 (“Form 943 taxes”) separately from employment taxes reportable on Form 941 or Form 944 (“Form 941 or Form 944 taxes”). Form 943 taxes and Form 941 or Form 944 taxes are not combined for purposes of determining whether a deposit of either is due, whether the One-Day rule of paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies, or whether any safe harbor is applicable. In addition, Form 943 taxes and Form 941 or Form 944 taxes must be deposited separately. (See paragraph (b) of this section for rules for determining an agricultural employer's deposit status for Form 941 taxes). Whether an agricultural employer is a monthly or semi-weekly depositor of Form 943 taxes is determined according to the rules of this paragraph (g).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Monthly depositor.</E> An agricultural employer is a monthly depositor of Form 943 taxes for a calendar year if the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) is $50,000 or less. An agricultural employer ceases to be a monthly depositor of Form 943 taxes on the first day after the employer is subject to the One-Day rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. At that time, the agricultural employer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of Form 943 taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the succeeding calendar year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Semi-weekly depositor.</E> An agricultural employer is a semi-weekly depositor of Form 943 taxes for a calendar year if the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) exceeds $50,000.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Lookback period</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (g), the lookback period for Form 943 taxes is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 1993 is calendar year 1991. New employers shall be treated as having employment tax liabilities of zero for any lookback period before the date the employer started or acquired its business.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adjustments and Claims for Refund.</E> The employment tax liability reported on the original return for the return period is the amount taken into account in determining whether the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period exceeds $50,000. Any amounts reported on adjusted returns or claims for refund pursuant to sections 6205, 6402, 6413 and 6414 filed after the due date of the original return are not taken into account when determining the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period. However, prior period adjustments reported on Form 943 for 2008 and earlier years are taken into account in determining the employment tax liability for the return period in which the adjustments are reported.</P>

              <P>(5) The following example illustrates the provisions of this section.

                <P>A, an agricultural employer, employs both farm workers and nonfarm workers (employees in its administrative offices). <E T="03">A</E>'s depositor status for calendar year 1993 for Form 941 taxes will be based upon its employment tax liabilities reported on Forms 941 for the third and fourth quarters of 1991 and the first and second quarters of 1992 (the period July 1 to June 30). <E T="03">A</E>'s depositor status for Form 943 taxes will be based upon its employment tax liability reported on its annual Form 943 for calendar year 1991.</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Time and manner of deposit—deposits required to be made by electronic funds transfer</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 6302(h) requires the Secretary to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the development and implementation of an electronic funds transfer system to be used for the collection of the depository taxes as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section. Section 6302(h)(2) provides a phase-in schedule that sets forth escalating minimum percentages of those depository taxes to be deposited by electronic funds transfer. This paragraph (h) prescribes the rules necessary for implementing an electronic funds transfer system for collection of depository taxes and for effecting an orderly and expeditious phase-in of that system.<PRTPAGE P="390"/>

If the applicable effective date is January 1, 1995, or January 1, 1996, the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer applies to all deposits required to be made on or after the applicable effective date. If the applicable effective date is July 1, 1997, the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer applies to all deposits required to be made on or after July 1, 1997 with respect to deposit obligations incurred for return periods beginning on or after January 1, 1997. If the applicable effective date is January 1, 1998, or thereafter, the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer applies to all deposits required to be made with respect to deposit obligations incurred for return periods beginning on or after the applicable effective date. In general, each applicable effective date has one 12-month determination period. However, for the applicable effective date January 1, 1996, there are two determination periods. If the applicable threshold amount is exceeded in either of those determination periods, the taxpayer becomes subject to the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer, effective January 1, 1996. The threshold amounts, determination periods and applicable effective dates for purposes of this paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) are as follows:</P>

              <P>(C) This paragraph (h)(2)(i) applies only to deposits required to be made for return periods beginning before <PRTPAGE P="391"/>January 1, 2000. Thus, a taxpayer, including a taxpayer that is required under this paragraph (h)(2)(i) to make deposits by electronic funds transfer beginning in 1999 or an earlier year, is not required to use electronic funds transfer to make deposits for return periods beginning after December 31, 1999, unless deposits by electronic funds transfer are required under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Deposits for return periods beginning after December 31, 1999, and made before January 1, 2011.</E> Unless exempted under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, for deposits for return periods beginning after December 31, 1999, and made before January 1, 2011, a taxpayer that deposits more than $200,000 of taxes described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section during a calendar year beginning after December 31, 1997, must use electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section) to make all deposits of those taxes that are required to be made for return periods beginning after December 31 of the following year and must continue to deposit by electronic funds transfer in all succeeding years. As an example, a taxpayer that exceeds the $200,000 deposit threshold during calendar year 1998 is required to make deposits for return periods beginning in or after calendar year 2000 by electronic funds transfer.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Deposits made after December 31, 2010.</E> Unless exempted under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, a taxpayer that has a required tax deposit obligation described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section must use electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section) to make all deposits of those taxes made after December 31, 2010.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Voluntary deposits.</E> A taxpayer that is authorized to make payment of taxes with a return under regulations may voluntarily make a deposit by electronic funds transfer.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Taxes required to be deposited by electronic funds transfer.</E> The requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer under paragraph (h)(2) of this section applies to all the taxes required to be deposited under §§ 1.6302-1, 1.6302-2, and 1.6302-3 of this chapter; §§ 31.6302-1, 31.6302-2, 31.6302-3, 31.6302-4, and 31.6302(c)-3; and § 40.6302(c)-1 of this chapter.</P>

An electronic funds transfer</E> is any transfer of depository taxes made in accordance with Revenue Procedure 97-33, (1997-30 I.R.B.), (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), or in accordance with procedures subsequently prescribed by the Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Taxpayer.</E> For purposes of this section, a <E T="03">taxpayer</E> is any person required to deposit federal taxes, including not only individuals, but also any trust, estate, partnership, association, company or corporation.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> If any categories of taxpayers are to be exempted from the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer, the Commissioner will identify those taxpayers by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. (See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this chapter.)</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Separation of deposits.</E> A deposit for one return period must be made separately from a deposit for another return period.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Payment of balance due.</E> If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on the applicable tax return for the return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the taxpayer with regard to the return period, then the balance due must be remitted in accordance with the applicable form and instructions.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Time deemed deposited.</E> A deposit of taxes by electronic funds transfer will be deemed made when the amount is withdrawn from the taxpayer's account, provided the U.S. Government is the payee and the amount is not returned or reversed.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Time deemed paid.</E> In general, an amount deposited under this paragraph (h) will be considered to be a payment of tax on the last day prescribed for filing the applicable return for the return period (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return) or, if later, at the time deemed deposited under paragraph (h)(8) of this section. In the case of the taxes imposed by chapters 21 and 24 of the Internal Revenue Code, solely for purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder (relating to the period of limitation on credit or refund), if an amount is deposited prior to April 15th <PRTPAGE P="392"/>of the calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year that includes the period for which the amount was deposited, the amount will be considered paid on April 15th.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Time and manner of remittance with a return</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rules.</E> A remittance required to be made by this section that is authorized to be made with a return under regulations and is made with a return must be made separately from a remittance required by any other section. Further, a remittance for a deposit period in one return period must be made separately from a remittance for a deposit period in another return period.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment of balance due.</E> If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on the return for the return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the employer with regard to the return period pursuant to this section, the balance due must be remitted in accordance with the applicable form and instructions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Time deemed paid.</E> In general, amounts remitted with a return under this section will be considered as paid on the date payment is received by the Internal Revenue Service at the place prescribed for filing by regulations or forms and instructions (or if section 7502(a) applies, by the date the payment is treated as received under section 7502(a)), or on the last day prescribed for filing the return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return), whichever is later. In the case of the taxes imposed by chapter 21 and 24 of the Internal Revenue Code, solely for purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder (relating to the period of limitation on credit or refund), if an amount is remitted with a return under this section prior to April 15th of the calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year that contains the period for which the amount was remitted, the amount will be considered paid on April 15th of the succeeding calendar year.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Voluntary payments by electronic funds transfer.</E> Any person may voluntarily remit by electronic funds transfer any payment of tax imposed by subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code. Such payment must be made in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.</P>

In cases in which a monthly return is required under § 31.6011(a)-5 but the taxes are not required to be deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in § 301.7512-1, the provisions of this section shall apply except those provisions shall not authorize the deferral of any deposit to a date after the date on which the return is required to be filed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Wages paid in nonconvertible foreign currency.</E> The provisions of this section are not applicable with respect to wages paid in nonconvertible foreign currency pursuant to § 301.6316-7.</P>

The lookback period is defined as the calendar year preceding the calendar year just ended. Thus, for purposes of determining if an R.R.T.A. employer qualifies to use the Monthly rule for calendar year 1993, a lookback must be made to calendar year 1991.

A taxpayer that treats backup withholding amounts separately with respect to reportable payments made after December 31, 1992, and before January 1, 1994, shall not take tax withheld under section 3406 into account for purposes of determining when the other taxes described in paragraph (e) of § 31.6302-1 must otherwise be deposited under that section.

                <P>For the last two calendar quarters of 1991 and the first two calendar quarters of 1992, Bank <E T="03">A</E> reports employment taxes with respect to wages paid totalling in excess of $50,000.

For deposit and reporting purposes, <E T="03">A</E> treated the backup withholding amounts separately from the employment taxes with respect to wages paid. Accordingly, for calendar year 1993, if <E T="03">A</E> chooses to treat the items separately, <E T="03">A</E> must use the Semi-Weekly rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(2) to deposit taxes with respect to wages paid but may use the Monthly rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(1) for the deposit of backup withholding amounts.

              <SUBJECT>Deposit rules for withheld income taxes attributable to nonpayroll payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> With respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes attributable to nonpayroll payments made after December 31, 1993, a taxpayer is either a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor based on an annual determination. Except as provided in this section, the rules of § 31.6302-1 shall apply to determine the time and manner of making deposits of nonpayroll withheld taxes as though they were employment taxes. Paragraph (b) of this section defines nonpayroll withheld taxes. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining whether a taxpayer is a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonpayroll withheld taxes defined.</E> For purposes of this section, effective with respect to payments made after December 31, 1993, <E T="03">nonpayroll withheld taxes</E> means—</P>
              <P>(1) Amounts withheld under section 3402(q), relating to withholding on certain gambling winnings;</P>
              <P>(2) Amounts withheld under section 3402 with respect to amounts paid as retirement pay for service in the Armed Forces of the United States;</P>
              <P>(3) Amounts withheld under section 3402(o)(1)(B), relating to certain annuities;</P>
              <P>(4) Annuities withheld under section 3405, relating to withholding on pensions, annuities, IRAs, and certain other deferred income; and</P>
              <P>(5) Amounts withheld under section 3406, relating to backup withholding with respect to reportable payments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of deposit status</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rules for calendar years 1994 and 1995.</E> On January 1, 1994, a taxpayer's depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the same as the taxpayer's status on January 1, 1994, for taxes reported on Form 941 under § 31.6302-1. A taxpayer generally retains that depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes for all of calendar years 1994 and 1995. However, a taxpayer that under this paragraph (c) is a monthly depositor for 1994 and 1995 will immediately lose that status and become a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes if the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) is triggered with respect <PRTPAGE P="395"/>to nonpayroll withheld taxes. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rules for calendar years after 1995</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> For calendar years after 1995, the determination of whether a taxpayer is a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year is based on an annual determination and generally depends on the aggregate amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes reported by the taxpayer for the lookback period as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Monthly depositor.</E> A taxpayer is a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) is $50,000 or less. A taxpayer ceases to be a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes on the first day after the taxpayer is subject to the One-Day rule in § 31.6302-1(c)(3) with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. At that time, the taxpayer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the succeeding calendar year. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Semi-weekly depositor.</E> A taxpayer is a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) exceeds $50,000.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Lookback period.</E> For purposes of this section, the lookback period for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 1996 is calendar year 1994. A new taxpayer is treated as having nonpayroll withheld taxes of zero for any calendar year in which the taxpayer did not exist.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rules.</E> A taxpayer must treat nonpayroll withheld taxes, which are reported on Form 945, “Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax,” separately from taxes reportable on Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return” (or any other return, for example, Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees”). Taxes reported on Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941 are not combined for purposes of determining whether a deposit of either is due, whether the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) applies, or whether any safe harbor is applicable. In addition, taxes reported on Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941 must be deposited separately. (<E T="03">See</E> paragraph (b) of § 31.6302-1 for rules for determining an employer's deposit status for taxes reported on Form 941.) Taxes reported on Form 945 for one calendar year must be deposited separately from taxes reported on Form 945 for another calendar year.</P>

              <FP>However, this (<E T="03">a</E>) of subdivision (i) shall not apply if the employer was required to make a deposit of taxes pursuant to (<E T="03">b</E>) of this subdivision (i) with respect to an eighth-monthly period which occurred during the calendar month.</FP>

For purposes of determining the amount of undeposited taxes at the close of an eighth-monthly period, undeposited taxes with respect to wages paid during a prior eighth-monthly period shall not be taken into account if the employer has made a deposit with respect to such prior eighth-monthly period. An employer will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(<E T="03">b</E>) for a deposit with respect to the close of an eighth-monthly period if—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) His deposit is not less than 95 percent (90 percent before January 1, 1982) of the aggregate amount of the taxes with respect to wages paid during the period for which the deposit is made, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If such eighth-monthly period occurs in a month other than the last month of a period for which a return is required to be filed (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as a return period), he deposits any underpayment with his first deposit which is otherwise required by this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(<E T="03">b</E>) to be made after the 15th day of the following month.</P>
              <FP>For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(<E T="03">b</E>), a “first-time 3-banking-day depositor” is an employer who establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he was not required (but for this exception) to make a deposit pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(<E T="03">b</E>) (or pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this section) with respect to each period in any preceding month of the current calendar quarter and with respect to each period in the 4 calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter. An employer may in no event qualify as a “first-time 3-banking-day depositor” with respect to any eighth-monthly period if the undeposited taxes at the close of that period are $10,000 or more.</FP>
              <FP>The excess (if any) of a deposit over the actual taxes for a deposit period shall be applied in order of time to each of the employer's succeeding deposits with respect to the same return period, until exhausted, to the extent that the amount by which the taxes for a subsequent deposit period exceed the deposit for such subsequent deposit period. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i), “eighth-monthly period” means the first 3 days of a calendar month, the 4th day through the 7th day of a calendar month, the 8th day through the 11th day of a calendar month, the 12th day through the 15th day of a calendar month, the 16th day through the 19th day of a calendar month, the 20th day through the 22nd day of a calendar month, the 23rd day through the 25th day of a calendar month, or the portion of a calendar month following the 25th day of such month.</FP>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) The periods within which taxes must be desposited under this section are determined, in the case of employers paying advance earned income credit amounts, by reference to the amount of taxes required to be deposited after reduction for advance amounts paid to employees.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a calendar month which begins after March 31, 1991, but before January 1, 1993—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Except as provided in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii) (<E T="03">b</E>) or (<E T="03">c</E>), or § 31.6302(c)-1(b), if with respect to any calendar month the aggregate amount of taxes (as defined in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii)) accumulated with respect to wages paid is $500 or more, but less than $3,000, then the employer shall deposit that aggregate amount in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution within 15 calendar days after the close of that calendar month. Taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in a prior calendar month within the same return <PRTPAGE P="397"/>period shall not be taken into account in determining the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated if a deposit was required to be made under this section with respect to such tax amounts. Deposits made during the calendar month of taxes with respect to wages paid during that month do not reduce the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated for purposes of determining the deposit requirement (if any) for that month. However, this paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(<E T="03">a</E>) shall not apply if the employer was required to make a deposit of taxes pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this section with respect to an eighth-month period which occurred during the calendar month.

                <P>Employer <E T="03">A</E>'s aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in April 1991 is $800.

The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated for the two eighth-monthly periods is $5,300. Since that amount is in excess of $3,000, a deposit obligation exists after the close of the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period.

                <P>Employer <E T="03">M</E>'s deposit obligation for the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, is $3,200. On April 8, 1991, three banking days after the close of the eighth-monthly period, <E T="03">M</E> deposits $4,000 in an authorized depository, $800 in excess of the amount required to be deposited. During the eighth-monthly period April 4-7, 1991, <E T="03">M</E> accumulates $3,750 in taxes with respect to wages paid during such period. Although the $800 overdeposit for the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period is credited to <E T="03">M</E>'s account, it may not be used to determine whether a deposit obligation exists for the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period. The two deposit obligations are separate and distinct. Since the amount of taxes accumulated with respect to the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period is an amount greater than $3,000, a deposit is required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this section within three banking days after the close of the period. <E T="03">M</E> has a remaining deposit obligation of $2,950 ($3,750 accumulated less $800 overdeposit) that must be satisfied by April 10, 1991, three banking days after the close of the period.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The employee tax withheld under section 3102,</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The employer tax under section 3111, and</P>

For the requirements relating to the deposit and payment of withheld tax and with respect to qualified State individual income taxes, see paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</FP>

              <P>(iv) If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on a return (other than a return on Form 942) for a return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the employer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section for such return period (<E T="03">a</E>) by $500 or more in the case of a return period which ends after December 31, 1980, or (<E T="03">b</E>) by more than $200 in the case of a return period which ends after December 31, 1970, and before January 1, 1981, the employer shall, on or before the last day of the first calendar month following the return period, deposit with a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution an amount equal to the amount by which the taxes reportable on the return exceed the total deposits (if any) made pursuant to subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph for such period. As used in this subdivision, the term “taxes” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, except that the term shall include the taxes referred to in (<E T="03">a</E>), (<E T="03">b</E>), and (<E T="03">c</E>) of such subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph with respect to any wages for domestic service in a private home of the employer which the employer elects to report on a quarterly return other than a quarterly return made on Form 942.</P>
              <P>(v) If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on Form CT-1, the return relating to an employer's railroad retirement tax payments, for a return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the employer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for such return period by $100 or more, the employer shall, on or before the last day of the second calendar month following the return period, deposit with a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution an amount equal to the amount by which the taxes reportable on Form CT-1 exceed the total deposits (if any) of such taxes made pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for such period.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Depositary forms</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A deposit required to be made by this section shall be made separately from a deposit required by any other section. An employer may make one, or more than one, remittance of the amount required to be deposited. However, a deposit for a period in one calendar quarter shall be made separately from any deposit for a period in another calendar quarter. An amount of tax which is not required to be deposited may nevertheless be deposited if the employer so desires.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Deposits.</E> Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be accompanied by a Federal Tax Deposit form. Such form shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. The remittance, together with the Federal Tax Deposit form, shall be forwarded to a financial institution authorized as a depositary for Federal taxes in accordance with 31 CFR Part 214 or, at the election of the employer, to a Federal Reserve bank. For procedures governing the deposit of Federal taxes at a Federal Reserve bank, see 31 CFR Part 214.7. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date stamped on the Federal Tax Deposit form by the Federal Reserve bank or the authorized financial institution or, if section 7502(e) applies, by the date the deposit is treated as received under section 7502(e). Each employer making deposits under this section shall report on the return, for the period with respect to which such deposits are made, information regarding such deposits according to the instructions that apply to such return and pay at that time (or deposit by the due date of such return) the balance, if any, of the taxes due for such period.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Time deemed paid.</E> In general, amounts deposited under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be considered as paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such return), or at the time deposited, <PRTPAGE P="401"/>whichever is later. For purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder, relating to period of limitation on credit or refund, if an amount is so deposited prior to April 15th of a calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year which contains the period for which such amount was so deposited, such amount shall be considered as paid on such April 15th.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Procurement of prescribed form.</E> Copies of the Federal Tax Deposit form will so far as possible be furnished employers. An employer will not be excused from making a deposit, however, by the fact that no form has been furnished to it. An employer not supplied with the Federal Tax Deposit form should make application therefor in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed. The employer may secure the form or additional forms by application therefor; such application shall supply the employer's name, identification number, address, and the taxable period to which the deposits will relate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Monthly returns.</E> The provisions of this section are not applicable with respect to taxes for the month in which the employer receives notice that returns are required under § 31.6011 (a)-5 (or for any subsequent month for which such a return is required), if those taxes are also required to be deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in § 301.7512-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) (which procedures are applicable if notification is given of failure to comply with certain employment tax requirements). In cases in which a monthly return is required under § 31.6011 (a)-5 but the taxes are not required to be deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in § 301.7512-1, the provisions of this section shall apply except that paragraph (a)(1)(iv) shall not authorize the deferral of any deposit to a date after the date on which the return is required to be filed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Wages paid in nonconvertible foreign currency.</E> The provisions of this section are not applicable with respect to taxes paid in nonconvertible foreign currency pursuant to § 301.6316-7 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Special requirement.</E> If an employer files a return on Form CT-1 for a return period beginning before January 1, 1984, and the taxes shown thereon exceed by more than $100 the total amount deposited by him pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section for such return period the employer shall, on or before the last day of the second calendar month following the period for which the return is filed, deposit with a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution an amount equal to the amount by which the taxes shown on the return exceed the total deposits (if any) made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section for such return period.</P>

An employer may make one, or more than one remittance of the amount required to be deposited. An amount of tax which is not required to be deposited may nevertheless be deposited if the employer so desires. If the aggregate amount of the taxes deposited is in excess of the taxes shown on the return, a credit or refund may be obtained; and in the event the excess is applied as a credit against such taxes for a subsequent return period, the employer shall reduce the amount of one or more of the deposits otherwise required for such subsequent return period by the amount of such credit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposits.</E> Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited shall be accompanied by a Federal Tax Deposit form which shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the remittance, together with the form, shall be forwarded to a financial institution authorized as a depositary for Federal taxes in accordance with 31 CFR part 214 or, at the election of the employer, to a Federal Reserve bank. For procedures governing the deposit of Federal taxes at a Federal Reserve bank, see 31 CFR part 214.7. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date stamped on the Federal Tax Deposit form by the Federal Reserve bank or the authorized financial institution or, if section 7502(e) applies, by the date the deposit is treated as received under section 7502(e). Each employer making deposits under this section shall report on the return, for the period with respect to which such deposits are made, information regarding such deposits according to the instructions that apply to such return and pay at that time (or deposit by the due date of such return) the balance, if any, of the taxes due for such period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Time deemed paid.</E> In general, amounts deposited under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be considered as paid on the last day prescribed <PRTPAGE P="403"/>for filing the return in respect of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such return), or at the time deposited, whichever is later. For purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder, relating to period of limitation on credit or refund, if an amount is so deposited prior to April 15th of a calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year in which occurs the period for which such amount was so deposited, such amount shall be considered as paid on such April 15th.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procurement of prescribed form.</E> Copies of the Federal Tax Deposit form will so far as possible be furnished employers. An employer will not be excused from making a deposit, however, by the fact that no form has been furnished to it. An employer not supplied with the form should make application therefor in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed. The employer may secure the form or additional forms by applying therefor and supplying its name, identification number, address, and the taxable period to which the deposits will relate. Copies of the Federal Tax Deposit form may be secured by application therefor.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act</E>—(1) <E T="03">Overcollection ascertained before return is filed.</E> (i) If an employer during any return period collects from an employee more than the correct amount of employee Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under section 3101 or employee Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) tax under section 3201, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the employee tax is required to be reported, repays or reimburses the amount of the overcollection to the employee before filing the return for such return period, and obtains and keeps as part of its records the written receipt of the employee showing the date and amount of the repayment or evidence of reimbursement, the employer shall not report on any return or pay to the IRS the amount of the overcollection.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any overcollection not repaid or reimbursed to the employee as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be reported and paid to the IRS on the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the overcollection is made. However, the reporting and payment of the overcollection may subsequently be treated as an overpayment error ascertained after the return is filed for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Error ascertained after return is filed.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if an employer files a return for a return period on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is reported, collects from an employee and pays to the IRS more than the correct amount of the employee FICA or RRTA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return and within the applicable period of limitations on credit or refund, the employer shall repay or reimburse the employee in the amount of the overcollection prior to the expiration of such limitations period. However, this paragraph (a)(2) does not apply to the extent that, after reasonable efforts, the employer cannot locate the employee, or the employee does not provide the employer with the written statement required by § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2)(iv). This paragraph (a)(2) has no application in any case in which an overcollection is made the subject of a claim by the employer for refund or credit under the procedure provided in § 31.6402(a)-2.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an employer files a return for a return period on which Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) is reported, collects from an employee and pays to the IRS more than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld from wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return but before the end of the calendar year in which the wages or compensation were paid, the employer shall repay or reimburse the employee in the amount of the overcollection prior to the end of the calendar year. However, this paragraph does not apply to the extent that, after reasonable efforts, the employer cannot locate the employee.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the employer repays the amount of the overcollection to an employee, the employer shall obtain and keep as part of its records the written receipt of the employee, showing the date and amount of the repayment.<PRTPAGE P="408"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) If the employer reimburses the amount of the overcollection to an employee, the employer shall keep as part of its records evidence of reimbursement. However, for purposes of overcollected Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a), the employer shall reimburse the employee by applying the amount of the overcollection against the employee FICA or RRTA tax which attaches to wages or compensation paid by the employer to the employee in the calendar year in which the overcollection is made. The employer shall reimburse the employee by applying the amount of the overcollection against the employee FICA or RRTA tax which attaches to wages or compensation paid by the employer to the employee prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitations on credit or refund. If the amount of the overcollection exceeds the amount so applied against such employee tax, the excess amount shall be repaid to the employee as required by this section.</P>
              <P>(v) If, in any calendar year, an employer repays or reimburses an employee in the amount of an overcollection of employee FICA or RRTA tax that was collected from the employee in a prior calendar year, the employer shall obtain from the employee and keep as part of its records a written statement that the employee has not claimed refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection, or if so, such claim has been rejected, and that the employee will not claim refund or credit of such amount. For this purpose, a claim for refund or credit by the employee includes instances in which the employee has included an overcollection of employee FICA or RRTA tax in computing a special refund (see § 31.6413(c)-1). This paragraph (a)(2)(v) does not apply for purposes of overcollected Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) which must be repaid or reimbursed to the employee in the calendar year in which the overcollection is made.</P>
              <P>(vi) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.</P>
              <P>(vii) For the period of limitations on credit or refund of taxes, see § 301.6511(a)-1.</P>
              <P>(viii) For corrections of FICA and RRTA tax paid under the wrong chapter, see § 31.6205-1(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) and § 31.3503-1.</P>

              <P>(ii) Any overcollection not repaid or reimbursed to the employee as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be reported and paid to the IRS on the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the overcollection is made. However, the reporting and payment of the overcollection may subsequently be treated as an overpayment error ascertained after the return is filed for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the employer reimburses the amount of the overcollection to an employee, the employer shall keep as part of its records evidence of reimbursement. The employer shall reimburse the employee by applying the amount of the overcollection against the tax under section 3402, which otherwise would be required to be withheld from wages paid by the employer to the employee in the calendar year in which the overcollection is made. If the amount of the overcollection exceeds the amount so applied against such tax, the excess amount shall be repaid to the employee as required by this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Adjustments of overpayments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) An employer who has overcollected or overpaid employee Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under section 3101 or employer FICA tax under section 3111, employee Railroad Retirement Tax (RRTA) tax under section 3201 or employer RRTA tax under section 3221, or income tax required under section 3402 to be withheld, and has repaid or reimbursed the amount of the overcollection of such tax to the employee, shall correct such error as provided in this section. However, this section only applies to overcollected or overpaid Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) if the employer has repaid or reimbursed the amount of the overcollection of such tax to the employee in the year in which the overcollection was made. Such correction may constitute an interest-free adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Every correction under this section of an overpayment of tax shall be made on the form prescribed by the IRS that corresponds to the return being corrected. The form, filed in accordance with this section and the instructions, will constitute an adjusted return for the return period being corrected.</P>
              <P>(3) Every adjusted return on which an overpayment is corrected pursuant to this section shall certify that the employer has repaid or reimbursed its employee, except where taxes were not withheld from the employee or where, after reasonable efforts, the employer cannot locate the employee. Every adjusted return shall designate the return period in which the error was ascertained and the return period being corrected, explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support the correction, and set forth such other information as may be required by this section and § 31.6413(a)-1 and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. Every adjusted return, filed by an employer, for overpayment of employee FICA tax under section 3101 or employee RRTA tax under section 3201 collected from an employee in a calendar year prior to the year in which the adjusted return is filed, must also certify that the employer has obtained the employee's written statement that the employee has not claimed refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection, or if so, such claim has been rejected, and that the employee will not claim refund or credit of the amount.</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of this section, an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.</P>

              <P>(5) For provisions related to furnishing employee statements and corrected employee statements reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-1. For provisions relating to filing information returns and corrected information returns reporting wages and <PRTPAGE P="410"/>withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-2.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act</E>—(1) <E T="03">Overcollection ascertained before return is filed.</E> If an employer collects more than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax from an employee, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the employee tax with respect to such wages or compensation is required to be reported, and repays or reimburses the employee under § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(1), the employer shall not report on any return or pay to the IRS the amount of the overcollection. If the employer does not repay or reimburse the amount of the overcollection under § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(1) before filing the return, the employer must report the amount of the overcollection on the return. However, the payment of the overcollection may subsequently be treated as an overpayment error ascertained after the return is filed for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Error ascertained after return is filed</E>—(i) <E T="03">Employee tax.</E> If an employer files a return for a return period on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is required to be reported and reports on the return more than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, and repays or reimburses the employee the amount of the overcollection of employee tax, as provided in § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2), the employer may correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall adjust the overpayment of tax by reporting the overpayment on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation was paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. However, for purposes of Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a), if the amount of the overcollection is not repaid or reimbursed to the employee under § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2)(ii), there is no overpayment to be adjusted under this section and the employer may only adjust an overpayment of such tax attributable to an administrative error, that is, an error involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount withheld, pursuant to this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the reporting of the overpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed before the expiration of the period of limitations on credit or refund. The employer shall take the adjusted amount as a credit towards payment of employment tax liabilities for the return period in which the adjusted return is filed unless the IRS notifies the employer that the adjustment is not permitted under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

The employer must first repay or reimburse the employee the amount of any overcollection of employee tax, if any, as required by § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2), before making the adjustment for the employer tax. The employer shall adjust the overpayment of tax by reporting the overpayment on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation was paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the reporting of the overpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed before the expiration of the period of limitations on credit or refund.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Erroneous withholding under section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code.</E> If a payor or broker withholds under section 3406 from a payee in error or withholds more than the proper amount of the tax under section 3406, the payor or broker may refund the amount erroneously withheld as provided in section 6413 and this section. A payor or broker will be considered to have withheld erroneously under section 3406 only if the amount is withheld because of an error by the payor or broker (e.g., an error in flagging or identifying an account that is subject to withholding under section 3406). The payor or broker may, in its discretion, treat the amount withheld <PRTPAGE P="412"/>as an amount erroneously withheld and refund it to the payee if—</P>
              <P>(i) The payor or broker requires a payee described in § 31.3406(g)-1(a) or described in a provision of the Internal Revenue Code requiring the reporting of a payment subject to withholding under section 3406 to certify that it is an exempt recipient, the payee fails to make the required certification, and the payor or broker subsequently withholds under section 3406 from a payment to the payee;</P>
              <P>(ii) The payor or broker does not require the payee to certify concerning its exempt status and the payor or broker withholds under section 3406;</P>
              <P>(iii) The payor or broker withholds under section 3406 from a payee after the payee provides a taxpayer identification number or required certification (including the documentation described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii), 1.6045-1(g)(3), or 1.6049-5(c) of this chapter) to the payor, but before the payor or broker treats the number or required certification as having been received under § 31.3406(e)-1(b); or</P>
              <P>(iv) The amount is withheld because a payor imposed backup withholding on a payment made to a person because the payee failed to furnish the documentation described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) of this chapter and the payee subsequently furnishes, completes, or corrects the documentation. The documentation must be furnished, completed, or corrected prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment is made and prior to the time the payor furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the payment for which the withholding erroneously occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (other than erroneous withholding occurring under the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section), if a payor or broker withholds because the payor or broker has not received a taxpayer identifying number or required certification and the payee subsequently provides a taxpayer identifying number or a required certification to the payor, the payor or broker may not refund the amount to the payee.</P>

If the amount of the erroneous withholding is refunded to the payee, the payor or broker must—</P>
              <P>(i) Keep as part of its records a receipt showing the date and amount of refund and must provide a copy of the receipt to the payee (a canceled check or an entry in a statement is sufficient, provided that the check or statement contains a specific notation that it is a refund of tax erroneously withheld);</P>
              <P>(ii) Not report on a Form 1099 as tax withheld any amount which the payor or broker has refunded to a payee; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Not deposit the amount erroneously withheld if the payor or broker has not deposited the amount of the tax prior to the time that the refund is made to the payee.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjustment after the deposit of the tax</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, if the amount erroneously withheld has been deposited prior to the time that the refund is made to the payee, the payor or broker may adjust any subsequent deposit of the tax collected under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code that the payor or broker is required to make in the amount of the tax that has been refunded to the payee.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Erroneous withholding from a payee that is a foreign person.</E> Where a payor withholds in error from a payee that is a nonresident alien or foreign person, as described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, the payor may refund some or all of the amount subject to backup withholding under section 3406. A refund may be paid in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) where the documentation is furnished, completed, or corrected prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment is made and prior to the time the payor furnishes a <PRTPAGE P="413"/>Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the payment for which the withholding erroneously occurred. The amount of the refund will be the amount erroneously withheld less the amount of tax required to be withheld, if any, under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under that chapter. With respect to the amount of the payment to the foreign person and the amount of tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (and the regulations thereunder), returns must be made in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1461-1 (b) and (c) of this chapter.</P>

              <FP>the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed by section 3101 with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom (whether or not paid) exceeds the employee tax with respect to the amount specified in (<E T="03">a</E>) through (<E T="03">h</E>) of this subdivision for the calendar year in question. Employee tax imposed by section 3101 with respect to tips reported by an employee to his employer and collected by the employer from funds turned over by the employee to the employer (see section 3102(c)) shall be treated, for purposes of this paragraph, as employee tax deducted from wages received by the employee. If the employee is required to file an income tax return for such calendar year (or for his last taxable year beginning in such calendar year) he may obtain the benefit of the special refund only by claiming credit as provided in § 1.31-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).</FP>

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>Employee A in the calendar year 1968 receives taxable wages in the amount of $5,000 from each of his employers, B, C, and D, for services performed during such year (or at any time after 1936), or a total of $15,000. Employee tax (computed at 4.4 percent, the aggregate employee tax rate in effect in 1968) is deducted from A's wages in the amount of $220 by B and $220 by C, or a total of $440. Employer D pays employee tax in the amount of $220 without deducting such tax from A's wages. The employee tax with respect to the first $7,800 of such wages is $343.20. A is entitled to a special refund of $96.80 ($440 minus $343.20). The $5,000 of wages received from employer D and the $220 of employee tax paid with respect thereto have no bearing in computing A's special refund since such tax was not deducted from his wages.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>

                <P>Employee E in the calendar year 1968 performs services for employers F and G, for which E is entitled to wages of $7,800 from each employer, or a total of $15,600. On account of such services, E in 1967 received an advance payment of $1,800 of wages from F; and in 1968, receives wages in the amount of $6,000 from F and $7,800 from G. Employee tax was deducted as follows: In 1967, $79.20 ($1,800 × 4.4 percent, the aggregate employee tax rate in effect in 1967) by employer F; and in 1968, $264.00 ($6,000 × 4.4 percent, the aggregate employee tax rate in effect in 1968) by employer F, and $343.20 ($7,800 × 4.4 percent) by employer G. Thus, E in the calendar year <PRTPAGE P="414"/>1968 received $13,800 in wages from which $607.20 of employee tax was deducted. The amount of employee tax with respect to the first $7,800 of such wages received in 1968 is $343.20. E is entitled to a special refund of $264.00 ($607.20 minus $343.20). The $1,800 advance of wages received in 1967 from F, and the $79.20 of employee tax with respect thereto, have no bearing in computing E's special refund for 1968, because the wages were not received in 1968. Such amounts could not form the basis for a special refund unless E during 1967 received from F and at least one more employer wages totaling more than $6,600.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Federal employees.</E> For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, each head of a Federal agency or of a wholly owned instrumentality of the United States who makes a return pursuant to section 3122 (and each agent designated by a head of a Federal agency or instrumentality who makes a return pursuant to such section) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term “wages” includes the amount which each such head (or agent) determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>) through (<E T="03">h</E>) of this section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents of one or more Federal agencies and the amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200 the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar year from an agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">State employees.</E> For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the term “wages” includes such remuneration for services covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act, relating to voluntary agreements for coverage of employees of State and local governments, as would be wages if such services constituted employment (see § 31.3121(a)-1, relating to wages); the term “employer” includes a State or any political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; and the term “tax” or “tax imposed by section 3101” includes an amount equivalent to the employee tax which would be imposed by section 3101 if such services constituted employment. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable whether or not any amount deducted from an employee's remuneration as a result of an agreement made pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act has been paid pursuant to such agreement. Thus, the special refund provisions are applicable to amounts equivalent to employee tax deducted from employees' remuneration by States, political subdivisions, or instrumentalities by reason of agreements made under section 218 of the Social Security Act. Moreover, if during any calendar year an employee receives remuneration for services covered by such an agreement and during the same calendar year receives wages from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such remuneration and wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Employees of certain foreign corporations.</E> For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the term “wages” includes such remuneration for services covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 3121(l), relating to agreements for coverage of employees of certain foreign corporations, as would be wages if such services constituted employment (see § 31.3121(a)-1, relating to wages); the term “employer” includes any domestic corporation which has entered into an agreement pursuant to section 3121(l); and the term “tax” or “tax imposed by section 3101” includes, in the case of services covered by an agreement entered into pursuant to section 3121(l), an amount equivalent to the employee tax which would be imposed by section 3101 if such services constituted employment. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable <PRTPAGE P="415"/>whether or not any amount deducted from the employee's remuneration by reason of such agreement has been paid to the district director. Thus, the special refund provisions are applicable to amounts equivalent to employee tax deducted from employees' remuneration by reason of agreements made under section 3121(l). A domestic corporation which enters into an agreement pursuant to section 3121(l) shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be considered an employer in its capacity as a party to such agreement separate and distinct from its identity as an employer employing individuals on its own account (see section 3121(l)(9)). If during any calendar year an employee receives remuneration for services covered by such an agreement and during the same calendar year receives wages for services in employment, the total amount of such remuneration and wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions. For provisions relating to agreements entered into under section 3121(l), see the regulations in part 36 of this chapter (Regulations on Contract Coverage of Employees of Foreign Subsidiaries).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Governmental employees in American Samoa.</E> For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the Governor of American Samoa and each agent designated by him who makes a return pursuant to section 3125(b) (see § 31.3125) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term “wages” includes the amount which the Governor (or any agent) determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>) through (<E T="03">h</E>) of this section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents pursuant to section 3125(b) and the total amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200, the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar year from the Government of American Samoa, from a political subdivision thereof, or from any wholly-owned instrumentality of such government or political subdivision and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Governmental employees in the District of Columbia.</E> For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the Commissioner of the District of Columbia (or, prior to the transfer of functions pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (81 Stat. 948), the Commissioners of the District of Columbia) and each agent designated by him who makes a return pursuant to section 3125(c) (see § 31.3125) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term “wages” includes the amount which the Commissioner (or any agent) determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>) through (<E T="03">h</E>) of this section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents pursuant to section 3125(c) and the total amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200 the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar year from the Government of the District of Columbia or from a wholly-owned instrumentality thereof and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Claims for special refund</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An employee who is entitled to a special refund under section 6413(c) may claim such refund under the provisions of this section only if the employee is not entitled to claim the amount thereof as a credit against income tax as provided in § 1.31-2 of this <PRTPAGE P="416"/>chapter (Income Tax Regulations). Each claim under this section shall be made with respect to wages received within one calendar year (regardless of the year or years after 1936 during which the services were performed for which such wages are received), and shall be filed after the close of such year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of claim.</E> Each claim for special refund under this section shall be made on Form 843, in accordance with the regulations in this subpart and the instructions relating to such form. In the case of a claim filed prior to April 15, 1968, the claim shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the employee resides or, if the employee does not reside in any internal revenue district, with the District Director, Baltimore, Md. 21202. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), in the case of a claim filed after April 14, 1968, the claim shall be filed with the service center serving such internal revenue district. However, in the case of an employee who does not reside in any internal revenue district and who is outside the United States, the claim shall be filed with the Director of International Operations, U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20225, unless the employee resides in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, in which case the claim shall be filed with the Director of International Operations, U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Hato Rey, P.R. 00917. The claim shall include the employee's account number and the following information with respect to each employer from whom he received wages during the calendar year: (i) The name and address of such employer, (ii) the amount of wages received during the calendar year to which the claim relates, and (iii) the amount of employee tax collected by the employer from the employee with respect to such wages. Other information may be required but should be submitted only upon request.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Period of limitation.</E> For the period of limitation upon special refund of employee tax imposed by section 3101, see § 301.6511(a)-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Special refunds with respect to compensation as defined in the Railroad Retirement Tax Act</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of any individual who, during any calendar year after 1967, receives wages (as defined by section 3121(a)) from one or more employers and also receives compensation (as defined by section 3231(e)) which is subject to the tax imposed on employees by section 3201 or the tax imposed on employee representatives by section 3211 such compensation shall, solely for purposes of applying section 6413(c)(1) and this section with respect to the hospital insurance tax imposed by section 3101(b), be treated as wages (as defined by section 3121(a)) received from an employer with respect to which the hospital insurance tax imposed by section 3101(b) was deducted. For purposes of this section, compensation received shall be determined under the principles provided in chapter 22 of the Code and the regulations thereunder (see section 3231(e) and § 31.3231(e)-1). Therefore, compensation paid for time lost shall be deemed earned and received for purposes of this section in the month in which such time is lost, and compensation which is earned during the period for which a return of taxes under chapter 22 is required to be made and which is payable during the calendar month following such period shall be deemed to have been received for purposes of this section during such period only. Further, compensation is deemed to have been earned and received when an employee or employee representative performs services for which he is paid, or for which there is a present or future obligation to pay, regardless of the time at which payment is made or deemed to be made.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Example.</E> The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example.

                <P>Employee A rendered services to X during 1973 for which he was paid compensation at the monthly rate of $650 which was taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act.

A also earned and received wages in 1973 from employer Y, which were subject to the employee tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, in the <PRTPAGE P="417"/>amount of $6,000. A paid hospital insurance tax on $13,800 ($7,800 compensation from X including $650 earned and deemed received in December 1973 but paid in January 1974 and not including $550 paid in January 1973 but earned and deemed received in December 1972, $6,000 compensation from Y) received or deemed received or earned in 1973. For purposes of the hospital insurance tax imposed by section 3101(b), these amounts are all wages received from an employer in 1973. Therefore, A is entitled to a special refund for 1973 under section 6413(c) and this section of $30 (1.0% × $13,800 − 1.0% × $10,800).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The amount of any payment on or after January 1, 1982, made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents on account of sickness or accident disability is not excluded from the term wages as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(A) unless such payment is—<PRTPAGE P="420"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Received under a workmen's compensation law (as defined in § 31.3121(a)(2)-1(d)(3) for payments made on or after December 15, 2005), or</P>
            <P>(2) Made by a third party pursuant to a contractual agreement between the employer and third party entered into prior to December 14, 1981, but then only if—</P>
            <P>(i) The third party's coverage for that employee's group ceases prior to March 1, 1982,</P>
            <P>(ii) No third party payment is made to such employee under that contract after February 28, 1982, and</P>
            <P>(iii) The cessation of the third party's coverage for that employee's group indefinitely terminates the contractual relationship between the third party and the employer as to sickness and accident disability benefits for that employee's group.</P>
            <FP>See section 3121(a)(4) and § 31.3121(a)(4)−1 for the exclusion from the term “wages” of any payment on account of sickness or accident disability made after the expiration of 6 calendar months following the last calendar month in which the employee worked.</FP>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The application of the provisions of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) may be illustrated by the following examples:

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>Company Q enters into a contract on August 31, 1981, with Insurance Company R to provide sickness and accident disability payments to Q's employees. The contract expires on February 28, 1982. On March 1, 1982, Q enters into a new contract with R to provide sickness and accident disability payments to Q's employees. Payments made by R pursuant to the contract expiring February 28, 1982, are included in “wages” as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(B).</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>Company S enters into a contract on November 15, 1981, with Insurance Company T to provide sickness and accident disability payments to S's employees. The contract expires on February 15, 1982, and is not renewed. A, one of S's employees, has been receiving sickness payments from T since December 1, 1981. T makes its final payment to A on February 22, 1982. The payments made by T to A pursuant to its contract with S are not included in “wages” as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(B).</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Workmen's compensation laws.</E> (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a payment made under a workmen's compensation law does not include a payment made pursuant to a State temporary disability insurance law.</P>
            <P>(2) If an employee receives a payment on account of sickness or accident disability which is not made under a workmen's compensation law and which must be repaid if the employee receives a workmen's compensation award with respect to the same period of absence from work, such payment is not excluded from the term “wages” as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(B).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Sickness or accident disability.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a payment made on account of sickness or accident disability includes any payment for personal injuries or sickness includible in gross income under section 105(a) and the regulations thereunder and thus does not include—</P>
            <P>(1) Any amount which is expended for medical care as described in section 105(b) and § 1.105-2,</P>
            <P>(2) Any payment which is unrelated to absence from work as described in section 105(c) and § 1.105-3, or</P>
            <P>(3) Any payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee as determined in paragraphs (d) and (e) of § 1.105-1.</P>
            <FP>A payment made on account of sickness or accident disability does not include any payment which is excludable from gross income under section 104(a) (2), (4), or (5).</FP>
            <FP>An employee who elects to reduce his compensation or to forgo an increase in his compensation under a salary reduction agreement with an employer will not be deemed to have made employee contributions to the sickness or accident disability plan or system if the employee is not subject to income or social security taxes on the reduction in compensation.</FP>
            <FP>A tax which is paid by an employee to fund a State temporary disability insurance program is considered a contribution by the employee for purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</FP>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Payments by third parties.</E> (1) Any third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability which payment is not excluded from the term “wages” under paragraph (a) of this section shall be treated as the employer with respect to such wages, <PRTPAGE P="421"/>except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. Accordingly, such third party must withhold from such payment the tax imposed on the employee by section 3101, pay the tax imposed on employers by section 3111, deposit such taxes pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-1(a), and provide the receipts required by section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2.</P>
            <P>(2) If any third party who is treated as the employer solely by reason of the applicability of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph promptly—</P>
            <P>(i) Withholds the tax imposed on the employee by section 3101,</P>
            <P>(ii) Deposits such tax pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-1(a), and</P>
            <P>(iii) Notifies the employer for whom services are normally rendered of the amount of the wages paid on which tax was withheld and deposited,</P>

            <FP>then the employer (and not the third party) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3111 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to the wages. For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the taxes described in subdivision (i) shall be treated by the third party as if included in the term “taxes” as defined in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii). For purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the notice must be provided by the third party within the time required for the deposit of the tax under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For the purpose of providing the notice, the rules of section 7502(a), relating to timely mailing being treated as timely filing, shall apply. The employer, if notified pursuant to subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph by a third party who has complied with the requirements of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, must deposit the tax imposed by section 3111 in accordance with § 31.6302(c)-1(a). For purposes of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii)(<E T="03">b</E>), with respect to the employer for whom services are normally rendered the term “taxes” shall not include any tax imposed on employers by section 3111 that is required to be paid by a third party under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph until the employer receives notification from the third party under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (2).</FP>
            <P>(3) A third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability to an employee as agent for the employer or making such a payment directly to the employer shall not be treated as the employer under subparagraph (1) with respect to such payment unless the agency agreement so provides. The determining factor as to whether a third party is an agent of the employer is whether the third party bears any insurance risk. If the third party bears no insurance risk and is reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is an agent of the employer even if the third party is responsible for making determinations of the eligibility of individual employees of the employer for payments on account of sickness or accident disability. If the third party is paid an insurance premium and not reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is not an agent of the employer, but the third party is treated as the employer as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e).</P>
            <P>(4) In order to avoid overpayment of taxes which would result from paying taxes—</P>
            <P>(i) On remuneration which exceeds the annual contribution and benefit base (as described in section 3121(a)(1)),</P>
            <P>(ii) With respect to a period of time which exceeds the 6-calendar-month period described in section 3121(a)(4), or</P>
            <P>(iii) On a payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee,</P>

            <FP>the third party may request information from the employer as to the total wages earned by the employee for the calendar year in which the third party is making payments, as to the last date on which the employee worked for the employer during such year, and as to the amount of any contribution by the employee. Except if the third party has reason not to believe any information supplied by the employer as the result of a request made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the third party may rely on such information in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e). The third party may not rely on representations of the employee as to the <PRTPAGE P="422"/>information which may be requested of the employer in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e).</FP>

            <P>(5) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Penalties and interest on payments made from January 1, 1982, to June 30 1982.</E> No penalty under section 6656(a) or interest under section 6601 will be assessed for the failure to make timely payments to the tax imposed by section 3101 or section 3111 on payments made on account of sickness or accident disability, which payments of tax are made after December 31, 1981, and before July 1, 1982, to the extent that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Special rules.</E> (1) For purposes of subdivision (iii) of paragraph (e)(2), the last employer for whom the employee worked prior to becoming sick or disabled or for whom the employee was working at the time he became sick or disabled shall be deemed to be the employer for whom services are normally rendered, provided that such employer made contributions on behalf of such employee to the plan or system under which the employee is being paid.</P>

Accordingly, such third party must withhold from such payment the tax imposed on the employee by section 3201 and the tax imposed on the employee representative by section 3211, if applicable, pay the tax imposed on employers by section 3221, deposit such taxes pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-2(a), and provide the receipts required by section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2.</P>

            <P>(iii) Notifies the employer for whom services are normally rendered of the amount of the compensation paid on which tax was withheld and deposited,</P>
            <FP>then the employer (and not the third party) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3221 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to the compensation. For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the tax described in subdivision (i) shall be treated by the third party as if included in the employee tax described in § 31.6302(c)-2(a)(1)(i). For purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the notice must be provided by the third party within the time required for the deposit of the tax under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For the purpose of providing the notice, the rules of section 7502(a), relating to timely mailing being treated as timely filing, shall apply. The employer, if notified pursuant to subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph by a third party who has complied with the requirements of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, must deposit the tax imposed by section 3221 in accordance with § 31.6302(c)-(2)(a). For purposes of § 31.6302(c)-2(a)(1)(ii), with respect to the employer for whom services are normally rendered the term “taxes” shall not include any tax imposed on employers by section 3111 that is required to be paid by a third party under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph until the employer receives notification from the third party under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (2).</FP>

            <P>(3) A third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability to an employee as agent for the employer or making such a payment directly to the employer shall not be treated as the employer under subparagraph (1) with respect to such payment unless the agency agreement so provides. The determining factor as to <PRTPAGE P="425"/>whether a third party is an agent of the employer is whether the third party bears any insurance risk. If the third party bears no insurance risk and is reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is an agent of the employer even if the third party is responsible for making determinations of the eligibility of individual employees of the employer for payments on account of sickness or accident disability. If the third party is paid an insurance premium and not reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is not an agent of the employer, but the third party is treated as the employer as provided in paragraph (1) of this paragraph (e).</P>

            <P>(iii) On a payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee,</P>
            <FP>the third party may request information from the employer as to the total wages earned by the employee for the calendar month in which the third party is making payments, as to the last date on which the employee worked for the employer, and as to the amount of any contribution by the employee. Except if the third party has reason not to believe any information supplied by the employer as the result of a request made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the third party may rely on such information in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e). The third party may not rely on representations of the employee as to the information which may be requested of the employer in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e).</FP>

            <P>
              <E T="03">a-1. Q. How did TEFRA change the law on withholding requirements for pensions, annuities, and other deferred income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. TEFRA amended the Internal Revenue Code to impose withholding requirements on designated distributions paid after December 31, 1982. Further, although under prior law individuals could elect to have Federal income tax withheld from certain pension and annuity payments, TEFRA requires withholding on all designated distributions unless the payee elects not to have withholding apply.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-2. Q. What type of payment is a designated distribution that is subject to the new withholding rules?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. A designated distribution is any distribution or payment from or under an employer deferred compensation plan, an individual retirement plan (as defined in section 7701(a)(37)), or a commercial annuity. However, a designated distribution does not include any portion of a distribution which it is reasonable to believe is not includible in the gross income of the payee. For rules concerning when it is reasonable to believe that all or part of a distribution is not includible in the gross income of the recipient, see questions a-24 through a-33. In addition, a payment or distribution that is treated as wages under section 3401(a) is not a designated distribution subject to the new withholding rules. For examples of these payments, see questions a-18 through a-23.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-3 Q. What is an employer deferred compensation plan for purposes of the new withholding rules?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. An employer deferred compensation plan is any pension, annuity, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other plan that defers the receipt of compensation.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-4. Q. What is a commercial annuity for purposes of the new withholding rules?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. A commercial annuity is an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract issued by an insurance company licensed to do business under the laws of any State. See, also, question f-21.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-5. Q. When does the new law take effect?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. In general, withholding is required on any designated distribution made after December 31, 1982. In the case of periodic payments beginning before January 1, 1983, the first payment after December 31, 1982 is treated as the first periodic payment for purposes of the withholding requirements. The Secretary has authority to delay (but not beyond June 30, 1983) the application of these withholding provisions to any payor if the payor can establish that it is impossible to comply with these provisions without undue hardship. Additionally, no penalty will be imposed for failure to withhold on periodic payments if the failure occurs before July 1, 1983, and if a good faith attempt is made to comply.</P>
            <P>Procedures for requesting a delay in implementation of the withholding provisions are under consideration.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-6. Q. What effect does the new law have on the old law provisions relating to withholding of tax from annuity payments by request?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. If payment is part of a designated distribution, the rules of section 3402(o) (relating to voluntary withholding on certain payments) do not apply. Therefore, a payee receiving amounts that are subject to withholding under the <PRTPAGE P="428"/>new provisions described in this regulation may not choose to use the voluntary withholding system of section 3402(o) with respect to those amounts. Also, if a payee had a fixed amount withheld by request, a different amount will probably be withheld when the new provisions take effect unless the rule provided in question a-7 applies. However, section 3402(o) will continue to apply to annuity payments that are not designated distributions, to sick pay, and to supplemental unemployment benefits.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-7. Q. If a recipient of a pension or annuity has previously elected voluntary withholding under section 3402(o), is the Form W-4P effective for withholding on payments after December 31, 1982?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes, if the plan administrator or payor wishes to honor it; the Form W-4P can be treated by the plan administrator or payor as an election to withhold the flat dollar amount specified on the form if the payee, is notified of his right to elect out of withholding and if he is notified that his previously filed W-4P will remain effective unless he elects out of withholding or files a new withholding certificate. If these requirements are met the plan administrator or payor may treat the Form W-4P as a voluntary withholding agreement under section 3402(p). See, also, section 3402(i). These amounts withheld should be reported in the same manner as amounts withheld under section 3405.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-8. Q. What amount of Federal income tax will be withheld from designated distributions?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The amount to be withheld by any payor (or, in certain cases, a plan administrator) depends upon whether the payment is a periodic payment, a nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total distribution, or a qualified total distribution. However, the maximum amount to be withheld cannot exceed the sum of the amount of money and the fair market value of property (other than employer securities as defined in section 402(a)(3)) received in the distribution.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-9. Q. What is a periodic payment?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. A periodic payment is an annuity or similar periodic payment whether paid by a licensed life insurance company, a financial institution, or a plan. The term “annuity” means a series of payments payable over a period greater than one year and taxable under section 72 as amounts received as an annuity, whether or not the payments are variable in amount.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-10. Q. How will federal income tax be withheld from a periodic payment?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. In the case of a periodic payment, amounts are withheld as if the payment were a payment of wages by an employer to the employee for the appropriate payroll period. If the payee has not filed a withholding certificate, the amount to be withheld is calculated by treating the payee as a married individual claiming three withholding allowances.</P>
            <P>For additional questions and answers concerning periodic payments, see part b.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-11. Q. How will Federal income tax be withheld from a “qualified total distribution?”</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. A “qualified total distribution” means any designated distribution which it is reasonable to believe is made within one taxable year of the payee, is made from or under a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or section 403(a), and consists of the balance to the credit of the employee under the plans. For additional questions and answers concerning qualified total distributions, see part c. The amount to be withheld on qualified total distributions will be determined under tables prescribed by the Secretary that approximate the tax that would be imposed under section 402(e) if the payee elected to treat the distribution as a lump sum distribution within the meaning of section 402(e)(4)(A). See, in this respect, question c-8.</P>

              <E T="03">a-12. Q. What amount of Federal income tax will be withheld from a designated distribution that is not a periodic payment or a qualified total distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. If a designated distribution is not a periodic payment or a qualified total distribution, the amount to be withheld is computed by multiplying the amount of the designated distribution by 10 percent.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-13. Q. Who must withhold?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Generally, the payor of a designated distribution must withhold, <PRTPAGE P="429"/>and is liable for payment of, the tax required to be withheld. However, in the case of a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) (relating to pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans), section 403(a) (relating to certain annuity plans), or section 301(d) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 (relating to certain employee stock ownership plans, sometimes called “TRASOP's”), the plan administrator must withhold, and is liable for payment of, the withheld tax unless he directs the payor to withhold the tax and furnishes the payor with any information that may be required by the Secretary in forms or regulations. This provision applies to qualified plans as well as once qualified plans that are no longer qualified. For a description of the material that the plan administrator must furnish to the payor, see question e-3.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-14. Q. Who is a plan administrator?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Under section 414(g), the plan administrator is the person specifically designated as the plan administrator by the terms of the plan or trust. If the plan or trust does not specifically designate the plan administrator (as provided in § 1.414(g)-1(a) of the Income Tax Regulations), then the plan administrator is generally determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) In the case of a plan maintained by a single employer, the employer is the plan administrator.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a plan maintained by two or more employers or jointly by one or more employers and one or more employee organizations, the association, committee, joint board of trustees, or other similar group of representatives who maintain the plan is the plan administrator.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case in which (1) or (2) does not apply, the person actually responsible for the control, disposition, or management of the assets is the plan administrator.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-15. Q. If a bank trustee, regulated investment company, or insurance company makes a periodic payment to a payee solely at the direction of an employer sponsored individual retirement account (IRA), is the bank trustee, regulated investment company or insurance company a payor subject to the pension withholding provisions?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. the term “payor” generally means the person actually paying the annuity or other payment (even if the person is acting as an agent). Because this is not a payment from a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a), responsibility for withholding is on the bank trustee, regulated investment company, or insurance company and not on the employer who sponsors the account.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-16. Q. If a bank trustee transfers plan funds to the employer who sponsors a plan described in section 401(a) and the employer makes the designated distributions, is the employer a payor?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. The employer is a payor because it acts as an agent for the bank trustee. Even though the plan administrator has transferred liability to the bank trustee under section 3405(c)(2), the transfer of funds to the employer does not relieve the bank trustee of its liability for withholding because the rule on transfer of liability only applies to plan administrators. Therefore, if the employer fails to withhold on designated distributions, either the employer or the bank trustee may be liable for failure to withhold. Note, however, that the plan administrator could transfer liability for withholding to the employer as payor under section 3405(c)(2). See, in this respect, questions e-2 and e-3.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-17. Q. Do the withholding provisions apply to annuities paid from an employer deferred compensation plan, an individual retirement plan, or a commercial annuity to the surviving spouse or other beneficiary of a deceased payee?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-18. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated distributions under all nonqualified employer deferred compensation plans?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. No. The withholding provisions relating to pensions and annuities do not apply to any amounts that are wages without regard to these provisions. Wages to which the general wage withholding rules apply mean any remuneration paid by an employer for services performed by an employee unless the amount paid falls within one of the exceptions of section 3401(a). For example, wages do not include remuneration paid to, or on behalf of, an employee or beneficiary from or to a trust qualified <PRTPAGE P="430"/>under section 401(a) and tax-exempt under section 501(a). There is no exception for contributions to, or benefits paid from, some nonqualified plans. In general, any contributions to, or benefits from, a nonqualified plan that are taxable under section 83 are subject to wage withholding at the time that they are includible in the recipient's gross income.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-19. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated distributions from a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a)?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Although a bond purchase plan is not a qualified plan, section 3402(a) does not apply to contributions to, or distributions from, such a plan. Therefore, designated distributions from a bond purchase plan are subject to the new withholding rules of section 3405. Similarly, the new withholding rules apply to designated distributions of an individual retirement bond described in section 409 or from an annuity plan described in section 403(a). For purposes of the withholding provisions of section 3405, a designated distribution from a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a) or an individual retirement bond described in section 409 occurs when an individual redeems a bond.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-20. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated distributions from a tax-sheltered annuity described in section 403(b)?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Section 31.3401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) of the Employment Tax Regulations provides that there is no withholding required under the wage withholding provisions to the extent that any amounts are taxable under the rules of section 72 or 403. Because designated distributions are not subject to the general wage withholding provisions, the new provisions of section 3405 apply to these designated distributions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-21. Q. An employer maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation plan such as a supplemental executive retirement (“top hat”) plan. Payments under the plan are made in the form of a single sum payment at retirement. Amounts paid at retirement are includible in income as compensation in the year received. Must the payor withhold on these amounts according to the rules in section 3405?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Section 3405(d)(1)(B)(i) provides that a designated distribution on which withholding is required does not include amounts that are wages without regard to the rules of section 3405. Therefore, withholding on payments that are includible in income as compensation are based on the rules for withholding on wages contained in section 3402.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-22. Q. Do the withholding provisions of section 3405 apply to a retirement plan maintained by a State or local government on behalf of its employees?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. A retirement plan maintained by a State or local government on behalf of its employees is a plan that defers the receipt of compensation. The fact that a plan deferring the receipt of compensation is maintained by a governmental unit does not make the withholding provisions inapplicable. Thus, annuity payments and other distributions under the Federal Civil Service Retirement System or under the plan of any State or municipality are subject to withholding.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-23. Q. Are payments from a state or local plan of deferred compensation described in section 457 subject to the withholding requirements of section 3405?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Amounts paid from a plan described in section 457 are paid from a plan that defers the receipt of compensation. However, amounts paid from a deferred compensation plan described in section 457 are wages under section 3401(a). Therefore, the general wage withholding rules, not the special rules of section 3405, apply to these payments.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-24. Q. An individual retires and begins receiving periodic payments under a commercial annuity contract that was distributed to him from a contributory qualified plan. The insurance company is the payor and is liable for withholding because the plan administrator has transferred liability under the rules of section 3405(c)(2). Must the payor determine whether the employee's investment in the contract is recoverable within three years?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Yes. Under section 72(d), if the annuity payments during the first three years equal or exceed the amount contributed by the employee to the plan, no amounts are includible in income until the employee's contributions are recovered. Because the application of <PRTPAGE P="431"/>section 72(d) may affect the extent to which it is reasonable to believe that amounts are not includible in income and, therefore, not subject to withholding, the payor must determine whether section 72(d) applies to the annuity payments. As a general rule, the information necessary to determine the employee's investment in the contract must be provided to the payor by the plan administrator. See, however, questions a-27 and a-33.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-25. Q. If the payor in question a-24 determines that the employee's investment in the contract is not recoverable within 3 years, must the payor compute the exclusion ratio under section 72(b) to calculate the amount of each payment that is not includible in gross income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. The operation of section 72(b) affects the extent to which it is reasonable to believe that amounts are not includible in gross income. Therefore, the payor must compute the exclusion ratio to determine what portion of each payment is subject to withholding under section 3405. As a general rule, the information necessary to determine the employee's exclusion ratio must be provided to the payor by the plan administrator. See, however, questions a-27 and a-33.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-26. Q. In questions a-24 and a-25, may the payor (i.e., the insurance company) rely on the information furnished by the plan administrator to determine the amounts that are includible in gross income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. In the absence of information to the contrary supplied by the payee, the payor may rely on the information furnished by the plan administrator. See, with respect to the plan administrator's duty to report to the payor, questions e-2 and e-3.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-27. Q. What is the result in questions a-24 and a-25 if the plan administrator fails to provide the payor with any information concerning the amount of employee contributions?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Until the earlier of December 31, 1983, or the date on which the plan administrator provides the payor with information concerning the amount of employee contributions, it is reasonable for the payor to assume that the employee's investment in the annuity contract is zero unless the payor has independent specific knowledge of the amount of employee contributions. Additionally, if the payee notifies the payor of the amount of employee contributions, the payor must compute the taxable portion of the payment based on the information supplied by the payee. If the plan administrator fails to provide the payor with this information on or before December 31, 1983, the plan administrator will be liable for failure to withhold and pay the tax due. See questions e-2 through e-5 for rules on the plan administrator's ability to transfer liability for withholding to the payor. See also question a-33 with respect to the plan administrator's failure to provide the necessary information prior to December 31, 1983.</P>

              <E T="03">a-28. Q. If a beneficiary receives the balance to the credit of an employee from an annuity described in section 403(b) on account of the employee's death, is it reasonable to believe that the $5,000 death benefit exclusion of section 101(b) is not includible in gross income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Although the amount of the death benefit exclusion allowable may be limited by section 101(b)(2)(B)(iii), the payor, for withholding purposes, may use the maximum death benefit exclusion ($5,000) in computing the amount of the distribution that is subject to withholding. See also, in this respect, question c-3.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-29. Q. What is the appropriate treatment of a distribution (whether periodic or nonperiodic) that includes employer securities?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Employer securities are significant in the calculation of amounts subject to withholding in two respects. First, the maximum amount to be withheld cannot exceed the sum of the amount of money plus the fair market value of property received, <E T="03">except</E> employer securities. In other words, a payor will not be forced to dispose of employer securities in order to meet withholding tax liability. Thus, for example, if an individual receives a distribution from a stock bonus plan that includes $1,000 worth of employer stock and $5 in cash for payment of fractional shares of stock, all of the cash, but none of the stock, may be retained by the payor to satisfy the withholding <PRTPAGE P="432"/>obligation. Second, under certain circumstances, the net unrealized appreciation in employer securities is not includible in gross income. See, in this respect, the rules of sections 402(a)(1) and 402(e)(4)(J).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-30. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that all net unrealized appreciation from employer securities is not includible in gross income in the case of a qualified total distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Although a qualified total distribution may include a distribution that is not a lump sum distribution, it is reasonable to believe that all net unrealized appreciation from employer securities is not includible in gross income.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-31. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that a distribution is not includible in gross income if the distribution consists of employee contributions from a plan described in section 401(a) and the amount distributed is not specifically designated as accumulated deductible employee contributions?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Employee contributions to a plan described in section 401(a) are not deductible from gross income when contributed unless they are deductible employee contributions under section 72(o)(5). Unless the payor has specific knowledge that employee contributions distributed from a plan described in section 401(a) are accumulated deductible employee contributions, it is reasonable to assume that the amounts are excludible from gross income in the year when received.</P>

              <E T="03">a-32. Q. In the case of disability payments paid under a noncontributory plan to a disability retiree who has not attained age 65, is it reasonable to believe that all amounts paid to the payee are includible in gross income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Whether or not all or part of the disability payments paid under a noncontributory plan to a permanently disabled retiree who has not attained age 65 are includible in gross income depends on the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer and on whether the taxpayer is permanently and totally disabled. In this situation, it is reasonable for the payor to assume that all amounts paid to the payee are includible in gross income unless the payor has specific independent knowledge that all or part of the periodic payments are not includible in gross income. Additionally, if the payee notifies the payor of the amount excludible from gross income, the payor must compute the taxable portion of the payment based on information provided by the payee.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-33. Q. In the case of a periodic payment, is it reasonable to believe that all amounts paid to the payee are includible in gross income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. As an alternative to the general rule that a designated distribution does not include amounts which it is reasonable to believe are not includible in gross income, the payor of any periodic payment may assume that the entire amount of the payment is includible in gross income. The wage withholding tables must be used without adjustment for the fact that Federal income tax is being withheld on the gross amount. If the payor uses this alternative method of calculating the amount of the designated distribution, he must include with the notice of the election not to have withholding apply the following additional statements:</P>
            <P>(1) Tax will be withheld on the gross amount of the payment even though the payee may be receiving amounts that are not subject to withholding because they are excludible from gross income;</P>
            <P>(2) This withholding procedure may result in excess withholding on the payment; and</P>
            <P>(3) The payee may adjust the allowances claimed on the withholding certificate if he wants a lesser amount withheld from each payment or he may provide the payor with the information necessary to calculate the taxable portion of each payment.</P>
            <P>This alternative will not apply to periodic payments made after the earlier of December 31, 1983, or the date on which the plan administrator supplies the payor with the information necessary to calculate the taxable portion of the distribution.</P>
            <P>See, also, questions e-3, e-4, and e-5.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-34. Q. May the payor rely on a plan administrator's computation of the amount to be withheld?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Yes. Although the plan administrator is not required to compute the amount to be withheld in order to transfer liability for withholding to the <PRTPAGE P="433"/>payor, the plan administrator may provide such information to the payor, and the payor may rely on such computations unless the payor knows or has reason to know that the computations are incorrect.</P>

Under the plans of certain States, individuals may receive payments from more than one retirement system, such as payments from the state's teacher's retirement plan and from the state's regular retirement plan. Must these payments be aggregated for purposes of providing a single notice and election to a payee or for purposes of determining whether the floor on withholding tax (i.e., $5,400 for a married individual claiming three allowances) has been reached?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. However, if it is feasible to aggregate payments under more than one retirement system, the payor is permitted to do so for these purposes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-36. Q. If a payment is made by one check to more than one beneficiary, such as a surviving spouse and a minor child, how is the amount to be withheld computed?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The payor may compute the withholding on a payment made by one check to more than one beneficiary as if the payment were made to only one beneficiary. In this case, the payor must base withholding for the total amount of the designated distribution on the withholding certificate of the payee to whom the election was sent.</P>
            <P>Alternatively, if each payee files a withholding certificate and the payor knows the amount of the payment of which each payee is entitled, the payor may determine the amount to be withheld with respect to each payee. If the payor does not know the amount of the payment to which each payee is entitled, he may treat the payment as being made pro-rata to each payee. If only one withholding certificate is received, the payor must base withholding for the total amount of the designated distribution on the withholding certificate of one of the payees, such as the surviving spouse's certificate. Thus, if notice of the election not to have withholding apply is supplied to each payee at the times required in section 3405(c) (10) and only one payee makes the election or files a certificate, the payor must assume that the election or filing was made by the payee on behalf of the other payees.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">a-37. Q. If a payor makes an error in computing the amount of a designated distribution that is subject to withholding, must the payor make a retroactive correction of the error?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. No, provided the error was a reasonable one. Thus, if a payor either underwithholds or overwithholds because the amount of the designated distribution (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the taxable portion of the payment) was incorrectly calculated, no retroactive make-up is required if one of the following applies: (1) The payor reasonably relied on information furnished by the plan administrator (including the computation of the amount to be withheld), (2) the payor relied on a payee's representations on the withholding certificate, (3) the payor reasonably relied on the rules of this regulation, or (4) the payor made a mathematical error in computations. However, if the amount of the designated distribution is correctly computed, but the payor makes an error in applying the withholding tables, the normal rules concerning failure to withhold and pay the tax will apply.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">b. Withholding on Periodic Payments</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">b-1. Q. Is the payor of periodic payments required to aggregate such payments with a payee's compensation to determine the amount of tax to be withheld under section 3405(a)(1)?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Although the payor must withhold from any periodic payment the amount that has to be withheld if the payment were a payment of wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period, the amount to be withheld under section 3405(a)(1) is calculated separately of any amounts that actually are wages to the payee for the same period.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">b-2. Q. Can either the percentage method (section 3402(b)) or the wage bracket method (section 3402(c)) be used to determine the withholding liability on a periodic payment?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Yes. Withholding on a periodic payment is accomplished by treating the payment as if it were wages. Therefore, unless the employee has elected not to have withholding apply, any <PRTPAGE P="434"/>method of withholding that is an appropriate method for withholding on wages is also an appropriate method for withholding on periodic payments. Refer to the Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E) and Publication 493, Alternative Tax Withholding Methods and Tables for the general procedures on withholding, deposit, payment, and reporting of Federal income tax withheld. Note, however, that any specific procedures contained in this regulation take precedence over any contrary rules in Circular E and Publication 493.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">b-3. Q. Do rules similar to those for wage withholding applly to the filing of a withholding certificate for periodic payments?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Unless the rules of section 3405 specifically conflict with the rules of section 3402, the rules for withholding on periodic payments will parallel the rules for wage withholding. Thus, if a withholding certificate is filed by a payee, it will generally take effect as provided in section 3402(f)(3) for certificates filed to replace existing certificates. If a withholding certificate is furnished by a payee on or before the date on which payments commence, it takes effect with respect to payments made more than 30 days after the certificate is furnished, unless the payor elects to make it effective at an earlier date. If a withholding certificate is furnished by a payee after the date on which payments commence, it takes effect with respect to payments made on or after the status determination date (January 1, May 1, July 1, or October 1) that is at least 30 days after the date the certificate is filed, unless the payor elects to make it effective at an earlier date. If no withholding certificate is filed, the amount withheld is determined as if the payee were a married person claiming three withholding allowances.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">b-4. Q. If no withholding certificate has been filed and the payor is aware that the payee is single, is it still appropriate to base withholding on a married individual claiming three allowances?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. If no withholding certificate is filed, the payor is not required or permitted to base withholding on the amount of allowances the payee actually is entitled to claim. Thus, the payor must base withholding on the rates for a married person with three withholding allowances.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">b-5. Q. May a payor determine whether payments to an individual are subject to withholding based on the amount of the first periodic payment for the year?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Periodic payments can vary during a calendar year because of make-up of past due payments, variable rates of payments, or cost-of-living adjustments, so that withholding based on the first payment within a year may be an inaccurate measure of withholding on total payments for the year. Therefore, the amount to be withheld is determined each payment period in the same manner as applies to withholding on wages.

              <E T="03">b-6. Q. If a payment period is specified as by the terms of a commercial annuity contract, must this period be used as the appropriate period for determining the amount to be withheld?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Similarly, if the payment period is designated in a plan administrator's report or on an individual retirement account payout schedule agreed to by payor and payee, this period must be used as the appropriate payment period.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">b-7. Q. If the payor received no report from the plan administrator or beneficiary concerning the payment period, but knows the frequency of payments, can the known frequency be used as the appropriate payment period?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. However, if no report is received and the payor has no knowledge of the frequency of payments, then he must treat the distribution as a nonperiodic distribution. Therefore, a distribution cannot be a periodic payment unless the frequency of payments is known. See, in this respect, questions b-8 and c-2. For rules concerning the plan administrator's failure to provide this information, see questions e-2 and e-3.</P>

            </P>

            <P>A. Yes. Because the one-time payment is a catch-up of prior amounts due as periodic payments, it is treated <PRTPAGE P="435"/>as part of a series of periodic payments. These payments are treated for withholding purposes in a manner similar to the treatment of supplemental wage payments in § 31.3402(g)-1 of the Employment Tax Regulations.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">c-1. Q. Must an individual receive a lump-sum distribution within the meaning of section 402(e)(4) to have a qualified total distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. A “qualified total distribution” is any distribution that (i) is a designated distribution, (ii) is reasonable to believe is made within one taxable year of the recipient, (iii) is made under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a), and (iv) consists of the balance to the credit of the employee under such plan. Thus, a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) that does not meet the requirements (such as the minimum 5-year period of participation in section 402(e)(4)(H)) for a lump sum distribution within the meaning of section 402(e)(4) may still be a qualified total distribution for purposes of withholding.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">c-2. Q. If a class year plan permits annual withdrawal of participants' vested amounts, are these withdrawals considered periodic payments?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. No. A class year plan is a plan under which amounts contributed by an employer for a year become vested a number of years (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> five years) after the year in which the amounts are contributed. Generally, class year plans permit withdrawals each year of amounts that have vested during the year. However, these distributions are not made with respect to an established frequency of payments, so the withdrawals must be treated as nonperiodic distributions, subject to withholding at the 10 percent rate.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">c-3. Q. If a beneficiary receives the balance to the credit of a payee from an annuity contract on account of the payee's death, is this final payment a nonperiodic distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. The lump sum death benefit in this situation is a one-time payment that cannot be characterized as a periodic payment. The payment may be a qualified total distribution if the requirements of section 3405(c)(4) are satisfied, but otherwise it will be treated as a nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total distribution.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">c-4. Q. Is it permissible to assume that an individual is a calendar year taxpayer for purposes of determining whether a distribution is a “qualified total distribution?”</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes, unless the payor or plan administrator has reason to believe that the payee is not a calendar year taxpayer. The payor or plan administrator has reason to believe that the payee is not a calendar year taxpayer if the payee tells the payor or plan administrator that he is not a calendar year taxpayer.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">c-5. Q. Is a distribution of accumulated deductible employee contributions with earnings that is paid on account of an employee's separation from service treated as a qualified total distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. As long as the other requirements for a qualified total distribution are met, a distribution of accumulated deductible employee contributions with earnings is eligible for withholding at the rate applicable to qualified total distributions even though the distribution could never be a lump sum distribution. Because accumulated deductible employee contributions are treated separately in determining whether a distribution is a qualified total distribution, the answer would be the same even if the recipient received none (or a portion) of the vested employer contributions in his account.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">c-6. Q. What is meant by the “balance to the credit” of an employee under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a)?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. In general, the balance to the credit of an employee includes any amount credited to the employee under the plan on the date the distribution commences. The balance to the credit of an employee includes an amount credited after the date the distribution commences if it is attributable to services performed before that date or is attributable to earnings on an amount credited to the employee before that date. Additionally, the balance to the credit of an employee includes any amount payable as an annuity with respect to the employee under the plan. Amounts that have been placed in a separate account for the funding of medical benefits under section 401(h) or <PRTPAGE P="436"/>amounts that are forfeitable under the plan are not included in the balance to the credit of an employee. Finally, accumulated deductible employee contributions (within the meaning of section 72(o)(5)(B)) are not included in the balance to the credit of an employee for the purposes of determining whether a distribution is a “qualified total distribution.”</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">c-7. Q. Can a payor rely on a plan administrator's report in determining whether a distribution consists of the balance to the credit of an employee under a plan?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. If the plan administrator does not inform the payor that the distribution consists of the balance to the credit of the employee, the payor may not assume that the distribution is a qualified total distribution and must treat the distribution as a nonperiodic distribution that is not a qualified total distribution. However, the payor may rely on the payee's representations that a distribution does consist of the balance to the credit of the employee under the plan.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">c-8. Q. What table must be used to calculate the amount to be withheld from a “qualified total distribution?”</E>

            <P>
              <E T="03">d-1. Q. May a payee elect not to have Federal income tax withheld from a designated distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Withholding is not required on any periodic payment or nonperiodic distribution if the payee elects not to have withholding apply. If the payee makes this election, it is effective until revoked. The payor is required to provide each payee with notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply and of the right to revoke the election.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-2. Q. In the case of a designated distribution made on account of the death of an employee, who makes the election not to have withholding apply?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The election may be made by the beneficiary of plan benefits specified by the decedent in accordance with plan procedures or, if there is no designated beneficiary, by the beneficiary specified under the terms of the plan. If there is not a designated beneficiary and the terms of the plan do not specify a beneficiary, then the election may be made by the executor or the personal representative of the decedent.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-3. Q. Who is required to provide notice to the payee of the payee's right not to have withholding apply?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B) requires the payor to provide notice to the payee of the payee's right to elect not to have withholding apply. Thus, even if the plan administrator has failed to transfer liability for withholding to the payor, the payor must provide notice to the payees.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-4. Q. When must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be given for periodic payments?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. In the case of periodic payments, notice of the election must be provided not earlier than six months before the first payment and not later than when making the first payment. However, even if notice is provided at a date before the first payment,notice must also be given when making the first payment. Thereafter, notice must be provided at least once each calendar year of the right to make the election and to revoke the election.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-5. Q. Must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be provided to those payees whose annual payments are less than $5,400?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. However, under the statute, notice is only required to be provided when making the first payment. Therefore, a payor may provide notice to a payee with annual payments less than $5,400 by indicating to the payee when making the first payment that no Federal income tax will be withheld unless the payee chooses to have withholding apply by filing a withholding certificate, if the payor also provides information concerning where a withholding certificate may be obtained.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-6. Q. Must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be provided in the same manner to all payees?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. No. If the payor provides notice to all payees when making the first payment, the payor may, in addition, provide earlier notice as provided in section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(I) to selected groups of payees, such as those payees whose annual payments are over $5,400.<PRTPAGE P="437"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-7. Q. Must notice be attached to the first payment to satisfy the requirement that notice be provided “when making” the first payment?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Because many payees utilize electronic funds transfer to deposit their pension or annuity checks, notice does not have to be attached physically to the check.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-8. Q. If a payee utilizes electronic funds transfer and notice is mailed directly to the payee at the same time the check is issued, is the notice requirement satisfied even though the payee receives the notice fifteen days after the check is deposited?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Although it is desirable that the notice reach the payee immediately prior to or concurrent with receipt of the check, the notice requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the payee receives the notice within 15 days before or after receipt of the first payment.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-9. Q. When is the payor required to notify the payee of his right to elect not to have withholding apply to a nonperiodic distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(ii) requires that notice must be provided to the payee at the time of a nonperiodic distribution. Since notice provided at the time of the distribution could result in delay of receipt of the benefit check if the payee elects out of withholding, notice for nonperiodic distributions should be given not earlier than six months prior to the distribution and not later than the time that will give the payee reasonable time to elect not to have withholding apply and to reply to the payor with the election information. What is reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-10. Q. What is a “reasonable time” for notice with respect to a nonperiodic distribution from a qualified plan?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The “reasonable time” requirement is satisfied with respect to a nonperiodic distribution if the notice is included in the basic claim for benefits application that is provided to the participant by the plan administrator.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-11. Q. If the payor of a periodic payment provides notice of the election not to have withholding apply within the time specified by section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(I), may the payor specify a time prior to distribution by which the election must be made?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. The election not to have withholding apply is generally given effect as provided in section 3402(f)(3) for a certificate filed to replace an existing certificate. However, the payor may require that the election is made up to 30 days before the first payment to be effective for the first payment. See question b-3.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-12. Q. If the payor of a nonperiodic distribution provides notice of the election not to have withholding apply within a reasonable time prior to the distribution, may the payor specify a time prior to distribution by which the election must be made?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. The payee has the right to make or revoke an election at any time prior to the distribution. Therefore, the payor may place a deadline on the time to elect without delaying payment of the distribution, but must accept any election or revocation made up to the time of distribution.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-13. Q. What is a “reasonable time” for notice with respect to a distribution from an individual retirement account?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. A payor may provide notice of the election not to have withholding apply at the time the beneficiary requests a withdrawal from his individual retirement account. This rule also applies to distributions from bank sponsored prototype plans and other plans that permit withdrawals on request.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-14. Q. If notice is provided to a payee prior to the first payment of a periodic payment, why must it also be provided at the time of the first payment or distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(II) of the Internal Revenue Code requires such notice. In addition, because the payee has the right to make an election or to revoke a prior election at any time prior to the beginning of the payment period, notice must be provided when making the first payment in order to offer the payee ample opportunity to make or revoke an election not to have withholding apply even if the election will not be effective until later payments.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-15. Q. If a payee who has been receiving periodic payments is rehired by the same employer, has his benefits suspended, and then recommences receiving <PRTPAGE P="438"/>periodic payments, must notice again be provided to the payee?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Upon recommencement of benefits, the first payment thereafter is treated as the first payment for purposes of the notice requirements.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-16. Q. Must a payor provide notice if it is reasonable to believe that the entire amount payable is excludible from the payee's gross income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Amounts which it is reasonable to believe are not includible in gross income are not designated distributions. Therefore, no notice is required of the ability to elect not to have withholding apply.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-17. Q. If the payor of a periodic payment under a qualified plan knows that an employee's investment in an annuity contract will be recovered within three years, must he provide notice of the right to elect out of withholding at the time the first payment is made?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. The first payment is not a designated distribution, and, therefore, is not a periodic payment subject to the notice requirements of section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i). There is no withholding obligation until the employee's investment in the contract is recovered because those amounts that equal the investment in the contract are not includible in gross income and, therefore, are not designated distributions. Therefore, the first payment after the employee's investment in the contract is recouped is the first payment for purposes of the notice requirements.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-18. Q. What information concerning the election not to have withholding apply must be provided by the payor to the payee?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Notice to a payee must contain the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) Notice of the payee's right to elect not to have withholding apply to any payment or distribution and how to make that election,</P>
            <P>(2) Notice of the payee's right to revoke such an election at any time and a statement that the election remains effective until revoked,</P>
            <P>(3) A statement to advise payees that penalties may be incurred under the estimated tax payment rules if the payments of estimated tax are not adequate and sufficient tax is not withheld from the payment or distribution.</P>
            <P>In the event that the payor does not know what part of a distribution is includible in gross income and treats these payments as provided in question a-33, the following additional statements must be included with the notice:</P>
            <P>(1) Tax will be withheld on the gross amount of the payment even though the payee may be receiving amounts that are not subject to withholding because they are excludible from gross income,</P>
            <P>(2) This withholding procedure may result in excess withholding on the payment, and</P>
            <P>(3) The payee may adjust his allowances claimed on the withholding certificate if he wants a lesser amount withheld from each payment or he may provide the payor with the information necessary to calculate the taxable portion of each payment.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-19. Q. Is there any information that, although not required, it is desirable to include in the notice to payees?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. It is desirable to include a statement in the notice to payees that the election not to have withholding apply is prospective only and that any election made after a payment or distribution to the payee is not an election with respect to that payment or distribution.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-20. Q. May the plan administrator provide the notice to payees on behalf of the payor?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The plan administrator may provide notice on behalf of the payor. However, the payor has sole responsibility for providing this notice whether or not the plan administrator has shifted liability for withholding to the payor, and if the plan administrator fails to provide adequate notice, the payor is responsible.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-21. Q. Is there a sample notice that can be used to satisfy the notice requirement for periodic payments?</E>

            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. It is permissible to provide with the payment a statement that the payee has the right to elect out of withholding. For example, the following sample notice could be used to satisfy the notice requirement if the payor has provided notice previously:</P>
            <P>If Federal income taxes have been withheld from the [pension] OR [annuity] payments you are receiving and if you do not wish to have taxes withheld, you should notify [insert name and address]. However, if you elect not to have withholding apply to your [pension] OR [annuity] payments, or if you do not have enough Federal income tax withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payment, you may be responsible for payment of estimated tax. You may incur penalties under the estimated tax rules if your withholding and estimated tax payments are not sufficient.</P>
            <P>If Federal income taxes are not being withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payment because you have elected not to have withholding apply and if you wish to revoke that election and have Federal income taxes withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payments, you should notify [insert name and address].</P>

              <E T="03">d-28. Q. Must an employee who receives a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) that includes amounts attributable to employer contributions and to accumulated deductible employee contributions make two elections not to have withholding apply?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Although accumulated deductible employee contributions are treated separately in determining whether a distribution is a qualified total distribution, an employee needs to make only one election not to have withholding apply to any distributions occurring at the same time from or under the same plan. However, the plan administrator could require the employee to make separate elections with respect to the distributions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-29. Q. If the administrator of a plan described in section 401(a) makes a qualified total distribution to an employee out of funds contained in two or more trusts, must the employee make a separate election not to have withholding apply with respect to the distribution from each trust?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. The fact that a plan may use several trusts does not eliminate treatment of the distribution as a single qualified total distribution for which only one election is necessary.</P>

              <E T="03">d-30. Q. Is it permissible to provide notice to persons already in pay status on January 1, 1983, in a newsletter of the plan administrator?</E>
            </P>

            <P>a. Yes, provided that this notice is received by the payee within 15 days of the payee's receipt of the first periodic payment after December 31, 1982, and <PRTPAGE P="441"/>such notice provides the means to make an election and instructions for electing not to have withholding apply. It is desirable that payees be afforded the maximum opportunity to make the election provided by section 3405(a)(2). Payors are encouraged to give payees notice of their election opportunities at least 30 days before the first periodic payment after December 31, 1982.</P>

              <E T="03">d-31. Q. Is it permissible to provide the annual notice required by section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(III) on January 1, 1984, December 31, 1985, and January 1, 1986?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. The annual notice required by section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(III) should be provided at approximately the same time each calendar year.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-32. Q. Under what circumstances may an election made with respect to a nonperiodic distribution apply to subsequent distributions?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Generally, any election not to have withholding apply to a nonperiodic distribution may apply to any subsequent payment or distribution from or under the same plan or arrangement. However, the payor must still provide notice of the election and revocation procedures upon each subsequent distribution and must include the statement concerning liability for payment of estimated tax if the payee does not have withholding applied.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-33. Q. How may a payee who intends to make a qualifying rollover (as defined in section 402(a)(5) or section 408(d)(3)) of a distribution elect not to have Federal income tax withheld from the distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The payee may elect not to have withholding apply by making the election on the form provided by the payor. Alternatively, if the payee directs the payor to pay over the distribution to a qualified plan or an individual retirement account, the payor may treat this direction as an election not to have withholding apply.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">d-34. Q. If a payee claims more than 14 withholding allowances on a withholding certificate, must the payor remit a copy of the withholding certificate to the Internal Revenue Service?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Because a payee may, at any time, elect out of withholding, the rules of § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g) of the Employment Tax Regulations do not apply. Therefore, a payee may claim more than 14 allowances and the payor need not remit the withholding certificate to the Internal Revenue Service.</P>

              <E T="03">e-1. Q. If designated distributions are made from or under a plan described in section 401(a), who has responsibility for making the returns and reports required by section 6047(e)?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Generally, the plan administrator, as defined in section 414(g), is responsible for maintaining the records and making the reports required by section 6047(e). However, if the plan administrator fails to keep the required records and make the required reports, the employer maintaining the plan is responsible for the reports and returns.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-2. Q. How may a plan administrator of a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) transfer his duty to withhold to a payor?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. A plan administrator of a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) may transfer the liability for withholding by (1) directing the payor in writing to withhold the tax and (2) providing the payor with any required information. This direction is presumed to remain in effect until the plan administrator revokes it in writing.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-3. Q. What information must the plan administrator provide to the payor in order to transfer his liability for withholding?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The general rule is that the plan administrator must provide the payor with all information necessary to compute correctly the withholding tax liability. To satisfy this requirement, the plan administrator must explicitly inform the payor of the information that would be reportable on the Form W-2P or 1099R or that such information is not applicable to a particular payee or to any payments under the plan. For example, if the plan administrator is silent with respect to any employee contributions, he has not satisfied his reporting obligation even if there are no employee contributions to the plan. Thus, the plan administrator is expected to provide the payor with the following minimum information:</P>

            <P>(1) The name, address, and social security number of the payee and the payee's spouse or other beneficiary if applicable,<PRTPAGE P="442"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) The existence and amount of any employee contributions,</P>
            <P>(3) The amount of accumulated deductible employee contributions, if any,</P>
            <P>(4) The payee's cost basis in any employer securities and the current fair market value of the securities,</P>
            <P>(5) The existence and amount of any premiums paid for the current cost of life insurance that were previously includible in income,</P>
            <P>(6) A statement of the reason (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> death, disability, retirement) for the payment or distribution,</P>
            <P>(7) The date on which payments commence and the amount and frequency of payments,</P>
            <P>(8) The age of the payee and of the payee's spouse or designated beneficiary if applicable, and</P>
            <P>(9) Any other information required by Form W-2P or 1099R.</P>
            <P>If, prior to December 31, 1983, the plan administrator fails to provide the payor with the information required in items (2) through (5) the payor is liable for withholding. However, the payor may withhold on the payment as if all amounts are includible in gross income. See question a-33.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-4. Q. If, after December 31, 1983, the plan administrator does not notify the payor of the amount of employee contributions with respect to one payee, has withholding liability shifted to the payor?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. The plan administrator satisfies the requirements of question e-3 as to the information that must be supplied to the payor so long as the failure to provide the required information occurs on an infrequent basis or the plan administrator informs the payor in writing that he has made a good faith effort to supply all the required information but the amount of employee contributions as to a particular payee is unavailable.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-5. Q. If, after December 31, 1983, the plan administrator fails to supply the payor with any information concerning the existence or amount of any employee contributions, has withholding liability shifted to the payor?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. The plan administrator has not satisfied his reporting obligation as required in question e-3 as to employee contributions even if there are no employee contributions unless he affirmatively states that there are no employee contributions or states that the reporting of this item is not applicable in determining the payee's tax liability.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-6. Q. Is it permissible to satisfy the requirements of section 6047(e) by maintaining records necessary to provide the information contained on Form W-2P and 1099R?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Section 6047(e) will be satisfied if, in addition to the information necessary to complete Forms W-2P and 1099R, the following information is maintained:</P>
            <P>(1) Payee's date of birth (if known), and date of spouse's or designated beneficiary's birth (if applicable and known);</P>
            <P>(2) Plan administrator's name, address, and employer identification number (EIN);</P>
            <P>(3) Plan's name and identification number and sponsor's name, address, and EIN; and</P>
            <P>(4) Date on which payments commence and amount and frequency of payments.</P>

              <E T="03">e-7. Q. If the interim method of withholding on periodic payments (i.e., withholding on the gross amount) is used, must the employer, plan administrator, or issuer of any contract still maintain the information required by Form W-2P?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Even if this interim method is used, the recipient must be provided with the information that will enable him to determine his tax liability and adjust his claimed exemptions or claim a credit or refund.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-8. What events trigger the reporting requirements of section 6047(e)?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Reporting is required any time there is a designated distribution to which section 3405 applies. Therefore, the old law rule that distributions of less than $600 per year do not require reporting no longer applies. Additionally, an exchange of insurance contracts under which any designated distribution (including a tax-free exchange under section 1035) may be made is a reportable event even though a designated distribution does not occur. To insure proper reporting when a designated distribution is made under the new contract, it is anticipated that the issuer of the contract to be exchanged will provide the information <PRTPAGE P="443"/>necessary to compute the amount to be withheld to the policyholder and to the issuer of the new contract.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-9. Q. Will the reporting requirement be satisfied if Form W-2P or Form 1099R is filed?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. In the absence of other forms or regulations, the reporting requirement is satisfied if Form W-2P or Form 1099R is filed with respect to each payee.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">e-10. Q. How should the payor or plan administrator remit payments of amounts withheld under section 3405?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The payor or plan administrator must deposit the amount withheld under section 3405 an authorized financial institution in accordance with the provisions of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i) of the Procedure and Administration Regulations, which provides the procedures for depositing employment taxes. For purposes of applying these procedures to amounts withheld under section 3405, the term “taxes” as defined in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii) includes the income tax withheld under section 3405 with respect to designated distributions. A payor or plan administrator who remits these amounts in accordance with those rules must report the amounts deposited on the same Form 941 or 941E, whichever is appropriate, that he uses to report the employment taxes he had deposited under § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i).</P>

              <E T="03">f-1. Q. If a plan administrator or other payor distributes property other than cash to payees, is it permissible to use the value of the property as of the last preceding valuation date to determine the amount of Federal income tax that must be withheld from each distribution?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. In many situations, the plan administrator or payor will not be able to determine the value of property to be distributed as of the date of distribution without delaying payment to the payee. In these cases, the plan administrator or payor may determine the value of the property to be distributed as of the last preceding valuation date prior to the date of distribution, as long as the valuation is made at least once each year. If the most recent valuation date occurred within the 90 days immediately preceding the date of distribution, the next most recent valuation date may be used.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-2. Q. How is withholding accomplished if a payee receives only property other than employer securities?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. A payor or plan administrator must satisfy the obligation to withhold on distributions of property other than employer securities even if this requires selling all or part of the property and distributing the cash remaining after Federal income tax is withheld. However, the payor or plan administrator may instead permit the payee to remit to the payor or plan administrator sufficient cash to satisfy the withholding obligation. Additionally, if a distribution of property other than cash includes property that is not includible in a designated distribution, such as the distribution of U.S. Savings Bonds or an annuity contract, such property need not be sold or redeemed to meet any withholding obligation.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-3. Q. If a designated distribution includes cash and property other than employer securities, is it permissible to satisfy the withholding obligation with respect to the entire distribution by using the cash distributed, provided the cash distributed is sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes, as long as there is sufficient cash to satisfy the withholding obligation for the entire distribution. There is no requirement that tax be withheld from each type of property in portion to its value.</P>

              <E T="03">f-4. Q. If a loan from a qualified plan is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), is the amount of the loan subject to withholding under section 3405?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. If, and to the extent that, the loan is treated as a distribution when made, withholding is accomplished by withholding tax from the amount of the loan that is treated as a distribution. Thus, for example, if a loan of $12,000 that must be repaid within 5 years is made to a common law employee with a vested account balance of $5,000, $2,000 is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), and the payor or plan administrator must withhold tax from the $2,000.</P>

            </P>
            <P>A. No. However, all amounts received within one taxable year of the payee from the payor or plan administrator under the same plan or arrangement must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached. If the payor or plan administrator does not know at the time a first payment of $200 or less is made whether there will be additional payments during the year for which aggregation is required, the payor or plan administrator need not withhold from the first payment. If distributions are made within one taxable year under more than one plan of an employer, the plan administrator or payor may, but need not, aggregate the distributions for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached.</P>

              <E T="03">f-8. Q. How is withholding accomplished if a qualified total distribution is paid in installments during one taxable year of the payee?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Withholding can be accomplished on a qualified total distribution that is paid in installments within one taxable year by either one of the following methods:</P>
            <P>Under Option 1, the tax on the first installment is calculated under the qualified total distribution table. The tax on each subsequent installment is calculated by finding the tax under the table on the cumulative amount of the installments for the year and subtracting the amount of tax already withheld from the tax due with respect to the cumulative amount of the installments.</P>
            <P>Under Option 2, the payor or plan administrator can withhold the tax on all installments except the final installment at a 10 percent rate. The tax on the final installment may be calculated by finding the tax under the qualified total distribution table on the cumulative amount of the installments for the year and subtracting the amount of tax already withheld from the installments. Option 2 may be used even if the amount of the tax that should be withheld from the final installment under the qualified total distribution tables exceeds the amount of the final installment. The plan administrator or payor will not be subject to penalties under section 6651 with respect to the difference between the tax that should have been withheld from the final installment under the qualified total distribution tables and the amount of the final installment.</P>

            <P>The effect of these alternatives is illustrated by the following example:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <P>An individual receives within one taxable year the balance to his credit under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a). The balance to his credit is paid in three installments of $1,000, $10,000, and $60,000. The amount of tax to be withheld from the installments may be calculated under Option 1 or Option 2.</P>
              <P>Option 1—Withholding on each installment computed by finding tax under qualified total distribution tables on the cumulative amount of the distribution and subtracting the tax already withheld.</P>

              <E T="03">f-9. Q. A plan described in section 401 (a) invests in life insurance contracts for its participants. Each year the current cost of the life insurance element (PS 58 cost) is taxable to the participants under section 72. Is withholding required on this amount even though there is no amount actually distributed to the participant?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Because the PS 58 costs are not distributed or deemed to be distributed, they are not designated distributions for which withholding is required.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-10. Q. The plan administrator or payor of a plan described in section 401 (a) has been properly reporting distributions on a multiple contract basis for purposes of section 72. How should the plan administrator or payor determine the amount of each payment that is includible in gross income for withholding purposes?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. In the absence of revenue rulings or regulations to the contrary, the plan administrator or payor of a plan that properly reports distributions on a multiple contract basis should use that method to determine the taxable portion of a payment for withholding purposes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-11. Q. The plan administrator or payor of a plan described in section 401 (a) has been reporting distributions on a multiple contract basis for purposes of section 72 and has properly switched to the single contract method for reporting distributions. How should the plan administrator or payor determine the amount of each payment that is includible in gross income for withholding purposes?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. If a plan has properly switched from the multiple contract basis to the single contract basis for reporting distributions, the plan administrator or payor may assume that all amounts prior to the year of switch were reported by the payees on a multiple contract basis. Therefore, for example, in the case of an individual whose annuity payments have not commenced prior to the date of the switch to a single contract basis, the payee's investment in the contract can be assumed to have been recovered on a multiple contract basis prior to the year of the switch and on a single contract basis thereafter for purposes of determining the amount of each payment that is includible in gross income for withholding purposes. This rule applies even though payees may have amended their income tax returns for prior years to report all payments on a single contract basis.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-12. Q. If a plan that makes payments subject to the withholding and notice requirements of section 3405 makes separate payments to the same individual as a retired participant and as a surviving spouse of a retired participant, must the two payments be aggregated for withholding purposes?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No, unless the payor wishes to aggregate them.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-13. Q. An insurance company makes payments under certain variable annuity contracts. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (section 22(e)) applies to these variable annuity contracts and requires that the insurance company make a pay-out within 7 days after a payee requests a withdrawal from his contract. Under these circumstances, how may notice be provided to a payee of his right to elect out of withholding for a nonperiodic distribution?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. In this situation, the insurance company has only seven days in which to notify a payee of his right to elect out of withholding. It is not feasible for the insurance company to secure an election in writing unless the payee supplies the written election at the time he requests a withdrawal. Therefore, the notice and election can be provided in the following manner: (1) The insurance company may mail a notice to a payee on the day the request for withdrawal is received and (2) the notice may specify that unless the payee calls the company at a toll-free telephone number supplied on the notice within seven days of the date the request was received, the company will withhold from the distribution. Notice provided in this manner is deemed to satisfy the “reasonable time” requirement of question d-9. Insurance companies that encounter this problem are encouraged to supply an election form to a payee at the time an annuity contract is purchased. If a payee supplies an election with the request for withdrawal, notice still must be given but <PRTPAGE P="446"/>the insurance company may honor the election received if no other communication is received after notice is provided to the payee.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-14. Q. If an individual receives periodic payments from two or more plans of one member of a controlled group of corporations, separate periodic payments from two members of a controlled group of corporations out of one plan, or periodic payments from separate plans of two members of a controlled group, must the periodic payments be aggregated for withholding purposes?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No, unless the plan administrator or payor wishes to aggregate the payments. Section 414(b) does not require that plans of a controlled group of corporations be aggregated for withholding purposes. The same rule applies to a group of trades or businesses under common control or an affiliated service group described in section 414 (c) or (m).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-15. Q. How is withholding applied to a designated distribution from an individual retirement account (IRA) described in section 408(a) that is payable upon demand even though payments are scheduled to be made over a period certain greater than one year?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Distributions from IRAs that are payable upon demand are not periodic payments taxable under section 72 because they do not constitute annuity contracts within the meaning of section 408(d)(2). Therefore, designated distributions from an IRA that are payable upon demand are treated as nonperiodic distributions subject to withholding at the 10% rate even if the distributions are paid over a period certain.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-16. Q. Under the rules of section 72, a portion of certain payments that may vary because of investment experience, cost of living indices, or similar criteria is treated as not received as an annuity. For withholding purposes, must these amounts be treated as nonperiodic distributions even though part of each payment is a periodic payment?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. For withholding purposes, amounts will be considered periodic payments even though a portion of each payment is treated as an amount not received as an annuity under § 1.72-2(b)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-17. Q. Is the payor of distributions under a funded nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are payable as an annuity and taxable under section 72 required to withhold under section 3405?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Section 31.3401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) of the Employment Tax Regulations provides that any amounts received as an annuity and taxable under section 72 are excepted from the general definition of wages. Therefore, to the extent that section 402(b) requires that distributions from nonqualified plans which are received as an annuity are taxable under the rules of section 72, section 3405 will apply. See, however, question a-18 for the rules relating to distributions from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are taxable under section 83. Therefore, whether the payor or plan administrator of a nonqualified plan is required to withhold under section 3402 or section 3405 depends upon what section of the Code governs the taxation of amounts contributed or distributed.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-18. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender or upon the maturity or endowment of a commercial annuity subject to the new withholding rules?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender or upon the maturity or endowment of a commercial annuity are subject to the new withholding rules to the extent that they are designated distributions. Thus, withholding is required on the complete or partial surrender of an annuity, life insurance or endowment contract to the extent they are designated distributions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-19. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial surrender of a commercial annuity periodic payments?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Generally, no. Unless the amount paid in connection with the partial surrender is one of a series of payments payable over a period of greater than one year and taxable under section 72 as an amount received as an annuity, the amount paid is not a periodic payment.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-20. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender of an annuity contract subject to the new withholding rules?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Yes. Amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender of <PRTPAGE P="447"/>an annuity contract are subject to the new withholding rules to the extent that they are designated distributions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-21. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a commercial annuity that was acquired on or before August 13, 1982, or are otherwise described in section 72(e)(5), which are not treated as amounts received as an annuity under section 72, will not be includible in the gross income of the recipient?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Generally, yes. Under the rules of section 72(e) prior to the passage of TEFRA, amounts not received as an annuity were not taxable until the investment in the contract was recovered. Thus, for distributions that are not received as an annuity under a commercial annuity contract acquired on or before August 13, 1982, it is reasonable to believe that amounts distributed are not includible in the payee's gross income to the extent they represent unrecovered investment in the contract. The special transitional rule of question a-33, available for plan administrators, may be used until December 31, 1983, by payors of commercial annuities who lack records with regard to the payee's unrecovered investment in the contract.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-22. Q. For commercial annuity contracts entered into after August 13, 1982, which are not described in section 72(e)(5), is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed, which are not amounts received as an annuity under section 72, are not includible in gross income?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Generally, no. TEFRA amended section 72(e) to provide that amounts not received as an annuity will be includible in gross income until all earnings or other amounts that are not part of the investment in the contract have been distributed. Thus, it is not reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a commercial annuity contract entered into after August 13, 1982, are excludible from gross income until all earnings or other amounts that are not part of the investment in the contract have been distributed. This new rule does not apply to distributions from commercial annuities described in section 72(e)(5). Question f-21 provides the proper rule with respect to distributions from commercial annuities described in section 72(e)(5).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-23. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts involved solely in connection with an exchange of commercial annuities under section 1035 of the Code will not be includible in the gross income of the recipient?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Designated distributions include only amounts that it is reasonable to believe are includible in the gross income of the recipient. In the case of a commercial annuity exchange under section 1035 in which no cash or other property is exchanged, it is reasonable to believe that no portion is includible in the gross income of a recipient. An annuity exchange includes an exchange of annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts issued by a life insurance company licensed to do business under the laws of any State. Thus, such exchanges are not subject to the withholding rules of section 3405. However, see question e-8 concerning recordkeeping requirements with respect to the nontaxable exchange of commercial annuity contracts under section 1035.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-24. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a surrender of a life insurance or endowment contract, or in connection with an exchange of life insurance or endowment contracts in which cash or other property is distributed, will not be includible in gross income?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Generally, no. Amounts distributed in connection with the surrender of a life insurance or endowment contract, or in connection with an exchange of life insurance or endowment contracts in which cash or other property is distributed are includible in income to the extent that the amount received exceeds the policyholder's investment in the contract. However, if a life insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is surrendered within ten years of the date of its issuance, or is exchanged within ten years of the date of its issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $10,000. <PRTPAGE P="448"/>If a life insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is surrendered or exchanged ten years or more after the date of its issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $5,000. If the payor utilizes the special rule in the two preceding sentences, the payor must notify the policyholder, at the time described in question d-4, that all or part of the amount distributed may be includible in the policyholder's gross income. See question f-23 for additional rules concerning certain exchanges of annuity contracts.</P>

              <E T="03">f-25. Q. Do the requirements of section 3405(d)(10), relating to the time at which notice must be provided, also apply to the time at which an election out of withholding may be made?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Generally, yes. For example, an individual may not at commencement of employment execute an election out of withholding to be honored by a plan administrator or payor when the individual terminates employment and receives a distribution from a deferred compensation plan. See, however, question f-13 for a special rule applicable to certain annuity contracts.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-26. Q. If a payor provided notice prior to January 1, 1983, but failed to include all of the information required by question d-18, may the abbreviated notice of question d-27 be supplied when making the first payment?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes, as long as the abbreviated notice contains all of the information required by question d-18 that was not supplied with the earlier notice.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">f-27. Q. When must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be given as to designated distributions from an individual retirement account (IRA) described in section 408(a) that is payable on demand even though payments are scheduled to be made over a period greater than one year?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Under question f-15, designated distributions from an IRA that are payable upon demand are treated as nonperiodic distributions subject to withholding at the 10 percent rate even if the distributions are paid over a certain period. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i) requires the payor of a nonperiodic distribution to transmit to the payee notice, at the time of the distribution or at such earlier time as may be provided in regulations, of the right to elect not to have withholding apply. If distributions from an IRA have begun and are scheduled to be made at quarterly or more frequent intervals, then, in lieu of providing a notice at the time of each distribution, the payor may furnish a blanket notice applicable to all such distributions that are expected to be made to the payee from the account during a calendar year. Such a blanket notice must be furnished at a reasonable time before the first payment made in the calendar year to which the notice relates, except that a blanket notice relating to distributions from an IRA during 1983 may be made by the later of October 1, 1983, or the date of the first designated distribution from the IRA.</P>

            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. The Secretary has authority to delay, but not beyond June 30, 1983, the application of these withholding provisions to any payor or plan administrator if the payor or plan administrator can establish that he is unable to comply with these provisions without undue hardship.</P>

            <P>A. No. If a payor or plan administrator can establish that undue hardship would result if required to comply with the provisions of this section before April 1, 1983, prior approval from the Internal Revenue Service is not required and should not be requested. For purposes of this delay up to April 1, 1983, undue hardship will be presumed to exist, in the absence of bad faith, as long as the payor or plan administrator can establish that at least one of the conditions listed in question g-6 is present.

            <P>A. For purposes of these delay procedures, the term “undue hardship” generally means more than an inconvenience or increased costs to the payor or plan administrator. In the case of a payor or plan administrator who complies with the notice and withholding requirements of section 3405 on or before April 1, 1983, undue hardship will be presumed to exist if one or more of the following conditions is present:</P>
            <P>(1) The payor or plan administrator encounters significant delay or other substantial difficulty in obtaining authorization for funds to develop forms, to mail notices, to process responses, to develop new computer programs, or to obtain and train personnel to implement withholding.</P>
            <P>(2) The payor or plan administrator incurs substantial increases in unbudgeted costs to develop forms, to mail notices, to process responses, to develop new computer programs, or to obtain and train personnel.</P>
            <P>(3) There is difficulty in obtaining trained personnel, including professional or semi-professional individuals, whose skills are necessary to implement withholding.</P>
            <P>(4) Training new or present employees or hiring new employees to implement withholding would cause substantially increased costs or would disrupt the payor's or plan administrator's operations, and such disruption or increased costs would not occur if withholding were implemented at a later date.</P>
            <P>(5) Plan benefits change due to a collective bargaining agreement concluded between October 1, 1982, and April 1, 1983.</P>
            <P>(6) A payor who provided notice prior to January 1, 1983, receives a substantial number of inquiries from payees. These inquiries indicate the payees' lack of understanding of the new withholding provisions and the payor cannot answer all questions and receive responses by January 1, 1983.</P>
            <P>(7) The payor or plan administrator is unable to implement withholding on account of the occurrence of an event, such as fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, or strike, beyond the control of the payor or plan administrator.</P>
            <P>(8) The payor or plan administrator is scheduled to install a new data processing hardware package or system between December 1, 1982, and July 1, 1983, that will be used for the process of pension withholding.</P>
            <P>An examble of a circumstance not considered as resulting in undue hardship would be changes in the withholding tables effective July 1, 1983.</P>

            <P>The following examples illustrate situations in which an undue hardship that will permit delay in implementation of the notice and withholding provisions exists:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>

              <P>A is the payor and plan administrator of a deferred compensation plan that is the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. The collectively bargained plan has fewer than 100 participants receiving annuity payments. All of A's available budget is scheduled to be used to pay plan benefits and administrative costs, and no funds are available to implement the new withholding requirements. A must obtain authorization to expend funds to implement withholding. Meetings at which A can obtain such authorization are held August 1 and February 1 of <PRTPAGE P="450"/>each year. After obtaining authorization on February 1, 1983, A will need to develop and mail withholding notices and elections, process responses and determine the amount to be withheld from each payee's annuity payment. A can implement withholding on April 1, 1983, without substantially disrupting its operations, but earlier implementation would disrupt its normal operations. Under these facts, A experiences undue hardship until at least April 1, 1983, as a result of the circumstances described in items (1) and (4) of question g-6.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>

              <P>B, a bank, is a payor of pensions and annuities under plans described in section 401(a). The plan administrators of all these plans have transferred liability to B for withholding under section 3405. After T.D. 7839, relating to withholding from pensions, annuities and other deferred income, was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on October 14, 1982, B determines that the withholding provisions can be implemented before April 1, 1983, on a reasonaable schedule, without substantial increases in costs or disruption of daily bank operations, according to the following schedule:</P>
              <P>(a) B's counsel analyzes regulations and reports requirements to operations personnel; operations personnel develop new Forms, which are reviewed and revised by management and legal personnel; new forms are printed; personnel begin reprogramming computers, 8 weeks (Dec 9, 1982).</P>
              <P>(b) Forms distributed to branch offices, 1 week (Dec 16, 1982).</P>
              <P>(c) Forms mailed to payees, 1 week (Dec 23, 1982).</P>
              <P>(d) Time allowed for response to mailing of notices, answering questions, mailing follow-up notices to payees, 6 weeks (Feb 3, 1983).</P>
              <P>(e) Withholding calculated and entered into payment system, 6 weeks (Mar 17, 1983).</P>
              <P>Total: 22 weeks.</P>
              <P>Implementation is scheduled to begin March 17, 1983. Implementation prior to March 17, 1983, would substantially increase costs and would disrupt B's operations.</P>
              <P>Under these facts, B experiences undue hardship under item (4) of question g-6, up to March 17, 1983, the scheduled date of implementation.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-7. Q. If a payor or plan administrator qualifies for the delay described in question g-5, is there a procedure for requesting an additional delay up to July 1, 1983?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. However, any request made for this additional delay will be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is anticipated these requests will be carefully scrutinized and generally will be granted only in circumstances where the payor or plan administrator can reasonably expect that more than one of the conditions described in question g-6 will exist on or after April 1, 1983, and up to July 1, 1983.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-8. Q. How may a payor or plan administrator request this additional delay of up to 3 months for undue hardship?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The payor or plan administrator may request an additional delay of up to 3 months by filing in duplicate a written statement of undue hardship signed under penalties of perjury with the director of the service center where the payor or plan administrator files Form 941 or Form 941E. This written request must state on the envelope and at the top of the letter “PENSION WITHHOLDING: Undue Hardship” and must include all the information required in a statement of undue hardship as described in question g-9.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-9. Q. What information must the statement of undue hardship include?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The statement of undue hardship must include the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) The name, address, and taxpayer indentification number of the payor or plan administrator.</P>
            <P>(2) A complete statement of the facts upon which the payor is relying to show why a delay beyond April 1, 1983, is warranted. This statement must include as many of the conditions of undue hardship listed in question g-6 as pertain to the payor or plan administrator.</P>
            <P>(3) A schedule or plan of implementation showing dates on which the payor will implement the provisions of this section, with no date later than July 1, 1983. This schedule should provide a complete timetable that includes such items as development of forms, mailing of notices, time for responses, programming computers, and calculation of withholding.</P>
            <P>(4) An explanation of the steps taken which demonstrate the payor's or plan administrator's good faith attempt to comply with these notice and withholding requirements.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-10. Q. When must the plan administrator or payor file this request for delay and statement of undue hardship?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. Payors or plan administrators must file the statement of undue hardship on or before March 1, 1983. However, no request for delay may be filed with the Internal Revenue Service before January 1, 1983.<PRTPAGE P="451"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-11. Q. Who must request the delay?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. The delay should be requested by the payor or plan administrator who is actually liable for withholding. Therefore, generally the payor should request the delay. However, in the case of a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a), section 403(a), or section 301(d) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, the plan administrator is liable for withholding and should request the delay unless the plan administrator has transferred liability for withholding to the payor under section 3405(c).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-12. Q. If a plan administrator has not yet transferred liability for withholding under section 3405(c) or has inadequately transferred liability, and the payor requests a delay, will the request for delay be treated as if the plan administrator had requested it?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-13. Q. If a plan administrator and a payor both file requests for delay and statements of undue hardship with respect to the same plan, will there be two separate three-month extensions?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. A request for delay will delay the effective date only up to three months and in no case will it extend it past July 1, 1983.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-14. Q. What are the consequences for failure to file the request for delay and statement of undue hardship in a timely manner?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. If the request for delay and statement of undue hardship are not filed in a timely manner, the payor or plan administrator will not be entitled to any delay beyond the delay to which he may be entitled under question g-5. This rule will not apply in the case of an event such as strike, fire, flood, earthquake, or explosion that occurs after March 1, 1983, if compliance with the withholding provisions would have been possible absent the occurrence of the event.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-15. Q. Will a payor or plan administrator receive a response from the Internal Revenue Service as to whether a delay after April 1, 1983, has been granted?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. Since these requests for delay will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the payor or plan administrator will receive a response by April 1, 1983, as to whether or not a requested delay has been granted. If the request for delay is denied by the director of the service center, the payor or plan administrator is required to begin withholding by the later of April 1, 1983, or 10 days from the date on the response. No penalties will be imposed under section 6651 for failure to withhold between April 1, 1983, and the day 10 days from the date on the response.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-16. Q. If the director of the service center grants a delay up to July 1, 1983, must the payor or plan administrator retain a copy of the response from the Internal Revenue Service?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. In addition, the payor or plan administrator must attach a copy of the response to the first Form 941 or 941E filed after the response is received.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-17. Q. If a plan administrator or payor begins withholding before April 1, 1983, or July 1, 1983, can the payee request a refund from the plan administrator or payor of the amounts withheld?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. Because plan administrators and payors are required to comply with the withholding and notice requirements as soon as they no longer experience undue hardship, they cannot refund any amounts withheld to a payee, except as provided in the regulations under section 6413 (in the case of a mistake by the payor or plan administrator).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-18. Q. If a payor or plan administrator properly files the statement of undue hardship and receives a delay as provided in question g-7, will withholding from payments made after the delay period be required to make up for amounts that would have been withheld if there had been no delay granted?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. No. No catch-up withholding is required for plan administrators or payors who are entitled to a delay up to April 1, 1983, as provided in question g-5 or granted a delay up to July 1, 1983, as provided in question g-7. However, if a payor or plan administrator who is entitled to a delay up to April 1, 1983, as provided in question g-5, is not granted a delay up to July 1, 1983, but is unable to implement withholding until July 1, 1983, despite a good faith effort to comply, no penalties will be imposed under section 6651 if the payor or plan administrator withholds between July 1, 1983, and December 31, 1983, both the amounts required to be <PRTPAGE P="452"/>withheld during that period and the amounts that should have been withheld between April 1, 1983, and June 30, 1983.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-19. Q. If a payor or plan administrator does not receive and is not otherwise entitled to a delay under these regulations, will withholding from future payments be required to make up for amounts that would have been withheld if there had been no delay?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes, to the extent possible. An example of a situation in which a payor or plan administrator would not be able to withhold enough from subsequent payments to satisfy pre-July 1, 1983, withholding obligations is one where the recipient of a single life annuity died on July 1, 1983, before the payor or plan administrator began to withhold income tax from the annuity. In addition, a payor or plan administrator would not be able to satisfy the pre-July 1, 1983, withholding requirements if the payee elects out of withholding before all of the make-up withholding has been accomplished.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-20. Q. What are the consequences if the payor or plan administrator cannot establish undue hardship and does not comply on January 1, 1983?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. In general, if the payor or plan administrator cannot establish undue hardship and fails to withhold beginning January 1, 1983, the payor or plan administrator will be liable for the tax that should have been withheld and, in addition, the penalties provided in section 6651 will apply. However, the payor or plan administrator will not be liable for penalties for failure to file a return and for failure to pay the tax if a good faith effort is made to comply, and if, to the extent possible, withholding from post-implementation payments is sufficient to satisfy the pre-implementation withholding obligation. Whether the payor or plan administrator has made a good faith effort to comply depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The facts and circumstances that will be considered include, but are not limited to, those conditions listed in question g-6.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-21. Q. If a payor or plan administrator is required to make up amounts that should have been withheld, must he withhold from the first subsequent payment the entire amount that should have been previously withheld?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No. A payor or plan administrator may withhold a proportional amount out of each subsequent payment made before January 1, 1984.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-22. Q. Will the notice requirements of section 3405 apply before July 1, 1983, with respect to recipients of periodic payments that total less than $5400 per year?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-23. Q. Will the notice and withholding requirements of section 3405 apply before July 1, 1983, with respect to payments to nonresident alien individuals?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. No.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-24. Q. Does a payor or plan administrator who requested a delay prior to the publication of these procedures in the</E>
              <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
              <E T="03">need to resubmit the request in light of these procedures?</E>
            </P>
            <P>A. Yes. In order to be entitled to a delay, payors and plan adminstrators must follow the procedures required by these temporary regulations.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">g-25. Q. Will the notice and withholding requirements of section 3405 apply before January 1, 1984, with respect to the exchange or complete or partial surrender of a commercial annuity under which the recipient had not irrevocably chosen, prior to January 1, 1984, to receive payments in the form of an annuity?</E>
            </P>

            <P>A. In the case of the exchange or complete or partial surrender of a commercial annuity under which the recipient had not irrevocably chosen, prior to January 1, 1984, to receive payments in the form of an annuity, the application of the notice and withholding provisions of this section may be delayed, so long as undue hardship exists, up to January 1, 1984. Prior approval from the Internal Revenue Service is not required for such delay, and should not be requested. For purposes of this delay, undue hardship will be presumed to exist, in the absence of bad faith, so long as the payor can establish that at least one of the conditions in question g-6 is present. The payor should prepare and retain a statement of undue hardship as described in question g-9 and should maintain any documents necessary to <PRTPAGE P="453"/>support the representations made in that statement.</P>

The payor is required under section 3406(c)(4) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section to inform the payee that backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) has begun. The requirements for the notice that a payor must send to a payee are set forth in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section. The period for which backup withholding is required due to a notified payee underreporting is described in section 3406(e)(3)(A) and in paragraph (e) of this section.

            <P>(i) Payors to begin backup withholding on reportable interest or dividend payments due to a notified payee underreporting pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(C); and</P>
            <P>(ii) Brokers pursuant to section 3406(c)(5) that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice from a broker.</E> A broker who receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service that a payee is subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting and through whom the payee subsequently acquires a readily tradable instrument (as defined in section 3406(h)(6)) with respect to which the broker is not the payor is required to notify the payor of that instrument that the payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) in the time and manner provided in A-41 of § 35a.9999-1.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Accounts subject to backup withholding.</E> (i) <E T="03">In general.</E> After receiving notice from the Internal Revenue Service or from a broker, as provided in section 3406(d)(2)(B) and paragraphs (b) (1)(i) and (2) of this section, that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C), payors are required to withhold 20 percent of all reportable interest or dividend payments subject to backup withholding made with respect to all accounts of the payee.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Joint accounts.</E> Payors are required to withhold on joint accounts if the payee subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) is the first person listed on the account at the time the payor receives the notice to begin backup withholding. Backup withholding shall continue to apply to reportable interest and dividend payments made to that account even if the order of the names on the account is subsequently changed, provided that the name of the payee subject to backup withholding remains on the account.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Payors are not requied to withhold on reportable interest or dividend payments made with respect to an account of the payee that could not be located with reasonable care. The payor will be considered to have exercised reasonable care if the payor uses the name and taxpayer identification number (or names and taxpayer identification numbers if a joint return <PRTPAGE P="455"/>was filed by the payees) provided on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or from a broker as prescribed in paragraphs (b) (1)(i) and (2) of this section and in certain circumstances identified in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) any account numbers provided by the Internal Revenue Service in locating all accounts of a payee or payees. If a payee uses a different name on an account than the name stated on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or from a broker (for instance, due to marriage or adoption) and the payor can associate both names with the payee using records kept in the ordinary course of business, the payor will be treated as exercising reasonable care if the payor uses both names to locate accounts of the payee. If the taxpayer identification number is not provided to the payor or broker by the Internal Revenue Service, or if the taxpayer identification number provided by the Internal Revenue Service does not match the taxpayer identification number of the payee on the records that the payor or broker maintains in the ordinary course of business, the payor or broker is required to use any account numbers provided by the Internal Revenue Service to identify the payee and the payee's taxpayer identification number. This information must be used by the payor to locate other accounts of the payee and by the broker to locate the payors with respect to whom the payee subsequently acquires a readily tradable instrument through that broker.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice from payors of backup withholding due to a payee underreporting</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payor is required under section 3406(c)(4) to notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section that backup withholding has begun because of a notified payee underreporting. Payors who are notified by a broker that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) are also required to send the notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. As a result, the notice requirements provided in A-39 of § 35a.9999-1 and in the appendix to § 35a.9999-2 shall not apply to those payors notified by a broker that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). The payor must send the notice required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section to the payee no later than 15 days after the date that the payor makes the first payment subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). The payor must send the notice of backup withholding by first-class mail to the payee at his last known address. Rules similar to the rules in A-17, A-18, A-19, and A-20 of § 35a.9999-1 shall apply to the requirement to provide notice by first-class mail.</P>

See section 3406(a)(1)(D) for the backup withholding rules with respect to a payee's failure to make the certification under section 3406(a)(1)(D).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> A notice provided to a payee on or before April 23, 1987, will be deemed to satisfy the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section if it informs the payee that the payor has <PRTPAGE P="456"/>been instructed by the Internal Revenue Service to start backup withholding on reportable interest or dividend payments to the payee. If a payor who has started backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting on or before April 23, 1987, has not provided adequate notice to the payee on or before April 23, 1987, then the payor must provide notice to the payee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the date that is 45 days after April 23, 1987.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to stop backup withholding</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Internal Revenue Service will provide written certification to the payee that backup withholding is to stop and will notify the payors who were contacted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to stop withholding after the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination under paragraph (g) of this section that backup withholding with respect to a payee should stop. The Internal Revenue Service will also notify the brokers who were contacted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section that the payee is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and that the brokers are no longer obligated to provide notices to payors under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A broker who receives certification under this section from the Internal Revenue Service is not required to provide the certification to any payors to which the broker has previously provided the notice required under paragraph (b)(2).</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">No underreporting or undue hardship.</E> If the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination as set forth in paragraph (g)(1) (i) or (iii), the Internal Revenue Service will provide the notices required by paragraph (d)(1) of this paragraph no later than the 45th day after the day on which the Internal Revenue Service makes its determination.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Period during which withholding is required</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Upon receiving notice from the Internal Revenue Service after April 23, 1987, to begin backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) or notification from a broker stating that the payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payor must impose backup withholding on all reportable interest and dividend payments made to the payee during the period beginning after the close of the 30th day after the day on which the payor receives the notice provided in paragraph (b) (1)(i) or (2) of this section and ending as of the close of the day before the stop date (as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section).

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>The Internal Revenue Service makes a determination by October 15, 1987, that any underreporting with respect to A has been corrected. X, a payor who has been notified to backup withhold on payments of interest to A due to notified payee underreporting, receives written notice from the Internal Revenue Service on December 1, 1987, informing X that A is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and that X must stop backup withholding as of the close of December 31, 1987, or if later, the earlier of the close of the day 30 days after receipt of the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or receipt of the copy of the written certification provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service. The stop date, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, is January 1, 1988, and the payor must stop backup withholding as of the close of December 31, 1987.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>Assume the same facts as in <E T="03">Example 1</E> except that X, due to a change of address or for other reasons, does not receive the notice from the Internal Revenue Service to stop backup withholding until December 15, 1987. In addition, A does not provide X with a copy of the certification that was provided to A by the Internal Revenue Service until December 15, 1987. The stop date, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is January 14, 1988 (30 days after December 15, 1987), because that date is later than January 1, 1988. However, if a payor elects pursuant to section 3406(e)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section to determine the stop date without regard to that 30-day grace period, the stop date is January 1, 1987.</P>

The stop date, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is January 9, 1988 (30 days after December 10, 1987), because that date is earlier than January 14, 1988 (30 days after the day X received notice from the Internal Revenue Service), but later than January 1, 1988.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice to payees from the Internal Revenue Service</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice period.</E> After the Internal Revenue Service determines that a payee underreporting exists as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to section 3406(c)(1)(B), will mail to the payee at least four notices over a period of at least 120 days (hereafter referred to as the “notice period”) before payors and brokers will be notified that the payee is subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The notices may be incorporated with other notices provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Payee subject to withholding.</E> After the Internal Revenue Service provides the notices described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will send the notices required by paragraph (b) of this section unless—</P>
            <P>(i) A payee obtains a determination under paragraph (g) of this section, or</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of a payee who has filed a tax return, the Internal Revenue Service has not assessed the deficiency attributable to the underreporting.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Disclosure of names of payors and brokers.</E> The Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 3406(c)(5) may require a payee subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting to disclose the names of all of his payors of reportable interest or dividend payments and the names of all of the brokers with whom the payee has accounts which may involve reportable interest or dividend payments. To the extent required in the request from the Internal Revenue Service, the payee shall also provide his account numbers and other information necessary to identify the payee's accounts.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Backup withholding certification.</E> Once a payee receives a final notice from the Internal Revenue Service notifying him that his reportable interest or dividend payments are subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payee shall not certify to any payor or broker, under penalties of perjury, that he is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). See paragraph (k)(2) of this section for the penalties that will <PRTPAGE P="458"/>apply to a payee who makes a false certification. The payee may not make the certification until the payee receives the certification provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section from the Internal Revenue Service advising the payee that he is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) (as provided in A-33 of § 35a.9999-1). See A-37 of § 35a.9999-1 for the rule applicable to a payor who makes reportable interest or dividend payments to a payee who fails to certify that he is not subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Determination by the Internal Revenue Service that backup withholding should not start or should be stopped</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payee may prevent backup withholding from starting or stop it once it has started if, for the taxable year with respect to which there is a notified payee underreporting and any other taxable payee—</P>
            <P>(i) Shows that there was no payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section);</P>
            <P>(ii) Corrects any payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section);</P>
            <P>(iii) Shows that backup withholding will cause or is causing an undue hardship (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) and that it is unlikely that the payee will underreport interest or dividend payments again; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Shows that a bona fide dispute exists as to whether any underreporting has occurred (as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">No underreporting.</E> A payee may show that no underreporting of interest or dividends exists by presenting receipts or other satisfactory documentation to the Internal Revenue Service showing that all taxes relating to such payments were reported and paid timely or evidence showing that the payee did not have to file a return for the taxable year in question or that the underreporting determination is based upon a factual, clerical, or other mistake.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Correcting any payee underreporting</E>—(i) <E T="03">Before issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.</E> Before a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee pursuant to section 6212, the payee may correct underreporting by filing a return if one was not previously filed and paying taxes, penalties, and interest due with respect to any underreported interest or dividend payments.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">After issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.</E> After a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee, the payee may correct underreporting at any time by filing a return if one was not previously filed and paying the entire deficiency and any other taxes including penalties and interest attributable to any payee underreporting of interest or dividend payments. Thus, for example, a payee may correct underreporting after assessment of a deficiency by paying the entire assessment with respect to that deficiency and any other taxes including penalties and interest attributable to any payee underreporting of interest or dividend payments for other taxable years.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Undue hardship.</E> A determination of undue hardship will be based on the overall impact to the payee of having 20 percent of reportable interest and dividend payments withheld. Factors that will be considered in determining whether backup withholding causes undue hardship include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Whether estimated tax payments, and other credits for current tax liabilities, or amounts withheld on employee wages or pensions, in addition to backup withholding, would cause significant over-withholding;</P>
            <P>(ii) The payee's health, including the payee's ability to pay foreseeable medical expenses;</P>
            <P>(iii) The extent of the payee's reliance on interest and dividend payments to meet necessary living expenses and the existence, if any, of other sources of income;</P>

            <P>(iv) Whether other income of the payee is limited or fixed (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> social security, pension, and unearned income);</P>
            <P>(v) The payee's ability to sell or liquidate stocks, bonds, bank accounts, trust accounts, or other assets, and the consequences of doing so;</P>

            <P>(vi) Whether the payee reported and timely paid the most recent year's tax liability, including interest and dividend income; and<PRTPAGE P="459"/>
            </P>
            <P>(vii) Whether the payee has filed a bankruptcy petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court.</P>
            <FP>In addition to the above factors, the Internal Revenue Service must conclude that it is unlikely that any payee underreporting will occur again.</FP>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Bona fide dispute.</E> The Internal Revenue Service may make a determination under this paragraph if there is a dispute between the payee and the Internal Revenue Service on a question of fact or law that is material to a determination under paragraph (g)(1)(i) and, based upon all the facts and circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service finds that the dispute is asserted in good faith by the payee and there is a reasonable basis for the payee's position. See the example provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section for an illustration of this provision.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Requests for determinations</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A payee may request a determination under one or more of the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. Following its review of a request for a determination under paragraph (g) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will either provide the payee with a written certification as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section if the evidence presented warrants the requested determination or will provide the payee with a written notice informing him that a determination was not made.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Determinations made during the notice period.</E> In general, if a determination is made during the notice period as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then the payee will not be subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting with respect to any taxable year for which a determination was made.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Determinations made after the notice period.</E> If a determination is made after the notice period, as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will provide a notice to payors and brokers, and a certification to the payee as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Payees filing a joint return</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of section 3406(a)(1)(C), if payee underreporting is found to exist with respect to a joint return filed by a husband and wife, then the provisions of this section shall apply to the payees collectively. As a result, both payees will be subject to backup withholding on accounts in their individual names as well as accounts in their joint names. Either or both payees may satisfy the criteria for a determination that no payee underreporting exists, that the underreporting has been corrected, or that a bona fide dispute exists (as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), or (iv) of this section). Both payees, however, must satisfy the criteria for a determination that backup withholding will cause or is causing undue hardship (as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Innocent spouse.</E> A spouse who files a joint return may obtain a determination that withholding should stop or not start with respect to payments made to his or her individual accounts, if the spouse—</P>
            <P>(A) Shows that he or she did not underreport income because he or she is an innocent spouse as described in section 6013(e), or</P>
            <P>(B) Shows that there is a bona fide dispute as to whether he or she is an innocent spouse and hence did not underreport income.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example.</E> The provisions of paragraph (j)(2)(i) may be illustrated by the following example:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>H and W filed a joint return in 1986 on which H failed to include $2,000 of interest income. In 1987, the Internal Revenue Service determined that a payee underreporting exists with respect to H and W for the 1986 tax year. After properly notifying H and W of the underreporting and assessing the tax, the Internal Revenue Service sent notices to payors to begin backup withholding on the joint and individual accounts of H and W and to brokers informing them that H and W are subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) on their joint and individual accounts. W claims that she is an innocent spouse and requests a determination that she did not underreport interest or dividend income so that her individual accounts will not be subject to backup withholding.</P>

              <P>The Internal Revenue Service questions her status as an innocent spouse. If the Internal Revenue Service determines, based upon all the facts and circumstances, that there is a reasonable basis for W's claim to be an innocent spouse and that the claim is made in good faith, W will have a bona fide dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. <PRTPAGE P="460"/>Consequently, the individual accounts of W will not be subject to further backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>The Internal Revenue Service will notify payors to stop backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and brokers that W is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) on W's individual accounts. Backup withholding will not restart on those accounts unless the Internal Revenue Service ultimately determines that W is not an innocent spouse.

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The regulations in this part deal with the circumstances under which a domestic corporation may enter into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of extending the insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act to certain services performed outside the United States by citizens of the United States as employees of a foreign subsidiary of the domestic corporation, and with the obligations of a domestic corporation which enters into such an agreement. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, to which the regulations in this part pertain are contained in section 3121(1). The liabilities assumed under an agreement entered into pursuant to such section are based on the remuneration for services covered by the agreement. Such agreement may not be effective prior to January 1, 1955.</P>
            <P>(b) Although the obligations incurred under an agreement entered into pursuant to section 3121(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, must be distinguished from the obligations imposed on employers with respect to the taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, the two are similar in many respects. Accordingly, the regulations in this part are prescribed as a supplement to the regulations (26 CFR (1954), Part 31, Subpart B) relating to the employee tax and the employer tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. The terms used in the regulations in this part have the same meaning, unless otherwise provided, as when used in the regulations relating to the taxes imposed by such act.</P>
            <P>(c) The regulations in this part constitute Part 36 of title 26 of the Code of Federal Regulations. As used in the regulations in this part, the word “Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and the term “Federal Insurance Contributions Act” means chapter 21 of such Code. All references to sections of law are references to the Code unless otherwise indicated. The number of each section of the regulations begins with 36 followed by a decimal point (36.). Numbers which do not begin with 36 followed by a decimal point are numbers of sections of law unless otherwise indicated. In identifying sections of regulations, the symbol “§” is used.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Agreements entered into by domestic corporations with respect to foreign subsidiaries.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) Any domestic corporation having one or more foreign subsidiaries may request the Internal Revenue Service to enter into an agreement for the purpose of extending the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act to certain services performed outside the United States by all citizens of the United States who are employees of any such foreign subsidiary. See § 36.3121(l)(8)-1, relating to the definition of foreign subsidiary. Except as <PRTPAGE P="462"/>provided in § 36.3121(l)(5)-1, relating to the effect of the termination of an agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of section 3121(l), the Internal Revenue Service shall, at the request of a domestic corporation enter into such agreement on Form 2032 in any case where a Form 2032 is executed, and submitted by the domestic corporation in the manner prescribed in this section. A domestic corporation may not have in effect at the same moment of time more than one agreement on Form 2032.</P>
            <P>(2) An agreement authorized in section 3121(l)(1) may not be made applicable to any services performed outside the United States which would not constitute employment, for purposes of the taxes imposed under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, if the services were performed within the United States. Thus, such an agreement shall have no application with respect to any services performed outside the United States which, if performed within the United States, would be specifically excepted from employment under any of the numbered paragraphs of section 3121(b), or which, although not so excepted, would be deemed not to be employment by application of section 3121(c), relating to included and excluded services. Further, an agreement may not be made applicable with respect to any services performed outside the United States which constitute employment, as defined in section 3121(b). Thus, an agreement may not be made applicable to services for any employer performed by any employee on or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft when outside the United States, if (i) performed under a contract of service which is entered into within the United States or (ii) during the performance of which and while the employee is employed on the vessel or aircraft it touches at a port in the United States, because such services constitute employment as defined in section 3121(b). An agreement may not be made applicable to remuneration which would not constitute wages, as defined in section 3121(a), even if the services to which such remuneration is attributable had constituted employment.</P>

            <P>(3) The terms “corporation”, “domestic”, and “foreign”, as used in the regulations in this part, have the meaning assigned by paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), respectively, of section 7701(a). Section 701(a) (3), (4), and (5) provides as follows:

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Corporation.</E> The term “corporation” includes associations, joint-stock companies, and insurance companies.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Domestic.</E> The term “domestic” when applied to a corporation * * * means created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State or Territory.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and contents of agreement.</E> Form 2032 is the form prescribed for the agreement authorized in section 3121(l)(1). The agreement shall include provisions substantially as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) That the agreement shall apply to all services performed outside the United States by all citizens of the United States who are in the employ of the foreign subsidiary or subsidiaries to which the agreement is made applicable, but only to the extent that the remuneration paid each employee for such services would constitute wages if paid by one employer for services performed in the United States;</P>
            <P>(2) That the agreement shall not apply to any services which constitute employment within the meaning of section 3121;</P>
            <P>(3) That the agreement shall become effective on the first day of the calendar quarter in which the Form 2032 is signed by the district director or director of the service center or on the first day of the next succeeding calendar quarter, whichever is specified in the agreement;</P>

            <P>(4) That the domestic corporation will pay, as required by the regulations in this part, amounts equivalent to the sum of the taxes which would be imposed by sections 3101 and 3111, respectively, if the remuneration for the <PRTPAGE P="463"/>services covered by the agreement constituted wages;</P>
            <P>(5) That the domestic corporation will pay, in accordance with written notification and demand therefor to the domestic corporation, amounts equivalent to the interest, additions to the taxes, additional amounts, and penalties which would be applicable if the remuneration for services covered by the agreement constituted wages; and</P>
            <P>(6) That the domestic corporation will comply with all provisions of the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Execution and filing of Form 2032.</E> The request of any domestic corporation that the Internal Revenue Service enter into an agreement with the corporation on Form 2032 shall be signified by the corporation by executing and filing Form 2032 in triplicate. Such form shall be executed and filed in accordance with the regulations in this part and the instructions relating to the form. Each copy of the form shall be signed and dated by the officer of the corporation authorized to enter into the agreement, shall show the title of such officer, and shall have the corporate seal affixed thereto. A certified copy of the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors of the domestic corporation, or other evidence, showing the authority of such officer so to act shall accompany the form. Form 2032 executed and filed as provided in this paragraph shall be signed and dated by the district director or director of the service center and, upon such signing, the Form 2032 so executed and filed will constitute the agreement authorized in section 3121(l)(1). The Internal Revenue Service will return one copy of the agreement to the domestic corporation, will transmit one copy of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and will retain one copy (together with all related papers).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Liability for amounts equivalent to tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A domestic corporation which has entered into an agreement (as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1, or any amendment thereof (as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-2, incurs liability under the agreement in respect of certain remuneration paid by each foreign subsidiary named in the agreement, or any amendment thereof. Liability is incurred in respect of the remuneration paid to all those employees of the foreign subsidiaries who are citizens of the United States and who perform services outside the United States (other than services which constitute <PRTPAGE P="464"/>employment) for the foreign subsidiaries. However, liability is incurred only with respect to that portion of such remuneration paid by the foreign subsidiary which is attributable to services performed during the period for which the agreement is in effect with respect to such subsidiary, and then only to the extent that the remuneration would constitute wages if the services to which the remuneration is attributable were performed in the United States. Liability with respect to such remuneration is incurred in an amount equivalent to the sum of the employee and employer taxes which would be imposed by sections 3101 and 3111, respectively, if such remuneration constituted wages. If an individual performs services for more than one of the foreign subsidiaries named in an agreement, including any amendment thereof, such services are regarded as being performed in the employ of a single employer for purposes of determining the amount of the remuneration for such services which would constitute wages if the services were performed in the United States. See § 36.3121(l)(9)-1, relating to the treatment of a domestic corporation as a separate entity in its capacity as a party to an agreement.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>P. a domestic corporation, has entered into an agreement as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1, effective with respect to services performed on and after January 1, 1955. Three foreign subsidiaries, S-1, S-2, and S-3 are named in the agreement. A, a citizen of the United States, is employed during 1955 by S-1, S-2, and S-3, for the performance outside the United States of services covered by the agreement. In 1955 A is paid remuneration of $2,500 for such services by each of the foreign subsidiaries. The circumstances are such that the entire $7,500 would constitute wages if the services has been performed in the United States. However, only $4,200 of such remuneration would constitute wages if the services had been performed in the United States for a single employer, and it is with respect to this amount only that P incurs liability under its agreement.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>On August 1, 1955, P, the domestic corporation in the preceding example, amends its agreement to include therein its foreign subsidiary S-4. The amendment is in effect with respect to S-4 for the period beginning with October 1, 1955. B, a citizen of the United States, is employed by S-4 throughout 1955 for the performance of services outside the United States. B is paid remuneration of $500 in each month of 1955 for these services. The circumstances are such that the first $4,200 of such remuneration would constitute wages if the services had been performed in the United States, and, except for the $4,200 limitation, the remainder of such remuneration would constitute wages if the services had been so performed. P incurs no liability with respect to remuneration paid B for services performed for S-4 prior to October 1, 1955. However, P incurs liability under its agreement with respect to the $1,500 paid B in October, November, and December 1955, for services performed in these months. Since the remuneration paid to B for services performed during the first nine months of 1955 is not covered by the agreement, such remuneration is not taken into account in computing the $4,200 limitation or the liability under the agreement.</P>

Accordingly, P incurs no liability under the agreement with respect to the $500.00 paid in December 1955 for such services.</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Determination of liability.</E> The amount of the liability referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section incurred by a domestic corporation for any period shall be determined in the same manner as liability for the employee tax and for the employer tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act is determined, pursuant to regulations relating to the taxes under such act as in effect for the same period, with respect to wages paid by an employer to an employee.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Liability for amounts equivalent to interest or penalties.</E> A domestic corporation which has entered into an agreement as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 also incurs liability under the agreement for amounts equivalent to the amount of interest, additions to the taxes, additional amounts, and penalties which would be applicable if the remuneration for services covered by the agreement constituted wages.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Deductions from employees' remuneration.</E> There is no obligation to deduct, or cause to be deducted, from the remuneration of any employee of a foreign subsidiary any part of the amount due from a domestic corporation under its agreement.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Adjustments</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Errors in the payment of amounts for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes with respect to any payment of remuneration is incurred by a domestic corporation pursuant to its agreement are adjustable by the domestic corporation in certain cases without interest. However, not all corrections made under this section constitute adjustments within the meaning of the regulations in this part. The various situations in which such corrections constitute adjustments are set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section. All corrections in respect of underpayments and all adjustments or credits in respect of overpayments made under this section must be reported on a return filed by the domestic corporation under the regulations in this part and not on a return filed with respect to the employee and employer taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111, respectively. Every return on which such a correction (by adjustment, credit, or otherwise) is reported pursuant to this section must have securely attached as a part thereof a statement explaining the error in respect of which the correction is made, designating the calendar quarter in which the error was ascertained, and setting forth such other information as <PRTPAGE P="468"/>would be required if the correction were in respect of an overpayment or underpayment of taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. An error is ascertained when the domestic corporation has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it. An underpayment may not be corrected under this section after receipt from the district director or director of the service center of written notification of the amount due and demand for payment thereof, but the amount shall be paid in accordance with such notification.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Underpayments.</E> If a domestic corporation fails to report, on a return filed under the regulations in this part, all or any part of the amount for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes is incurred under its agreement with respect to any payment of remuneration, the domestic corporation shall adjust the underpayment by reporting the additional amount due as an adjustment on a return or supplemental return filed on or before the last day on which the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained is required to be filed. The amount of each underpayment adjusted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be paid, without interest, at the time fixed for reporting the adjustment. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this subparagraph but the amount thereof is not paid when due, interest thereafter accrues.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Overpayments.</E> If a domestic corporation pays more than the amount for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes is incurred under its agreement with respect to any payment of remuneration, the domestic corporation may correct the error, subject to the requirements and under the conditions stated in this paragraph, by deducting the amount of the overpayment from the amount of liability reported on a return filed by the domestic corporation, except that—</P>
            <P>(i) A correction may not be made in respect of any part of an overpayment which was collected from an individual by reason of the agreement unless the domestic corporation (a) has repaid the amount so collected to the individual, has secured the written receipt of the individual showing the date and amount of the repayment, and retains such receipt as a part of its records, or (b) has reimbursed the individual by reducing the amounts which otherwise should have been deducted from his remuneration by reason of the agreement; and</P>
            <P>(ii) A correction may not be made in one calendar year in respect of any part of an overpayment which was collected from an individual in a prior calendar year unless the domestic corporation has secured the written statement of the individual showing that he has not claimed and will not claim refund or credit of the amount so collected, and retains such receipt as a part of its records. See § 31.6413(c)-1 of this chapter, relating to claims for special credit or refund.</P>
            <FP>The correction constitutes an adjustment under this subparagraph only if it is reported on the return for the period in which the error is ascertained or on the return for the next following period, and then only if the correction is reported within the statutory period of limitation upon refund or credit of overpayments of amounts due under the agreement. See paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section relating to such statutory period. A claim for credit or refund may be filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for any overpayment of an amount due under the agreement which is not adjusted under this subparagraph.</FP>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Errors not adjustable</E>—(1) <E T="03">Underpayments.</E> If a domestic corporation fails to report all or any part of the amount for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes is incurred under its agreement with respect to any payment of remuneration, and such underpayment is not reported as an adjustment within the time prescribed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount of such underpayment shall be reported on the domestic corporation's next return, or shall be reported immediately on a supplemental return for the return period in which such payment of remuneration was made. The reporting of an underpayment under this subparagraph does not constitute an adjustment without interest.<PRTPAGE P="469"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Overpayments.</E> (i) If more than the correct amount due from a domestic corporation pursuant to its agreement (including the amount of any interest or addition) is paid and the amount of the overpayment is not adjusted under paragraph (a) (3) of this section, the domestic corporation may file a claim for refund or credit. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, such claim shall be made in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as to allowance of the claim as would be the case if the claim were in respect of an overpayment of taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. Refund or credit of an amount erroneously paid by a domestic corporation under its agreement may be allowed only to the domestic corporation.</P>
            <P>(ii) Any claim filed under this subparagraph shall be plainly marked “Claim under section 3121(1).”</P>
            <P>(iii) No refund or credit of an overpayment of the amount due from a domestic corporation under its agreement will be allowed after the expiration of 2 years after the date of payment of such overpayment, except upon one or more of the grounds set forth in a claim filed prior to the expiration of such 2-year period.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Deductions from employees' remuneration.</E> If a domestic corporation deducts, or causes to be deducted, from the remuneration of an individual for services covered by the agreement amounts which are more or less than the employee tax which would be deductible therefrom if such remuneration constituted wages, any repayment to the individual (except to the extent otherwise provided in this section), or further collection from the individual, in respect of such deduction is a matter for settlement between the individual and the domestic corporation or such other person as may be concerned.</P>

            <P>(i) More than 50 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation is owned by the domestic corporation; or</P>
            <P>(ii) More than 50 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation is owned by a second foreign corporation and more than 50 percent of the voting stock of the second foreign corporation is owned by the domestic corporation.</P>

              <P>P, a domestic corporation, owns 51 percent of the voting stock of S-1, a foreign corporation. S-1 owns 51 percent of the voting stock of S-2, a foreign corporation. S-2 owns 51 percent of the voting stock of S-3, a foreign corporation. S-1 and S-2 are foreign subsidiaries of P for purposes of the regulations in this part. Since neither P nor S-1 owns more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-3, S-3 is not a foreign subsidiary of P within the meaning of the regulations in this part.</P>

              <P>Assume the same facts as those stated in example <E T="03">1</E> except that 25 percent of the voting stock of S-2 is transferred by S-1 to P. P owns no other voting stock of S-2. Accordingly, after the transfer, P and S-1 together own more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-2, but neither P nor S-1 alone owns more than 50 percent of such stock. S-2 ceases to be a foreign subsidiary of P when such transfer is effected.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">On or after August 1, 1956.</E> (1) Beginning August 1, 1956, a foreign corporation is a foreign subsidiary of a domestic corporation, within the meaning of the regulations in this part, if—</P>

            <P>(ii) More than 50 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation is owned by a second foreign corporation and not less than 20 percent of the voting stock of the second foreign corporation is owned by the domestic corporation.</P>

            <P>(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

              <P>P, a domestic corporation owns 20 percent of the voting stock of S-1, a foreign corporation. S-1 is, therefore, a foreign subsidiary of P. S-1 owns 51 percent and P owns 15 percent of the voting stock of S-2, a <PRTPAGE P="470"/>foreign corporation. S-2 is also a foreign subsidiary of P, and this would be so even if P owned none of the voting stock of S-2. S-2 owns 51 percent, S-1 owns 39 percent, and P owns 10 percent of the voting stock of S-3, a foreign corporation. Since P owns less than 20 percent of the voting stock of S-2 and less than 20 percent of the voting stock of S-3, and since S-1 owns not more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-3, S-3 is not a foreign subsidiary of P within the meaning of the regulations in this part.</P>

              <P>Assume the same facts as those stated in example <E T="03">1</E> except that 4 percent of the voting stock of S-2 is transferred by S-1 to P. After, as well as before, the transfer of 66 percent of the voting stock of S-2 is owned by P and S-1 together. After the transfer, however, P owns less than 20 percent and S-1 owns not more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-2.

            <SUBJECT>Domestic corporation as separate entity.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A domestic corporation which enters into an agreement as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 shall, for purposes of the regulations in this part and for purposes of section 6413(c)(2)(C), relating to special credits or refunds, be considered an employer in its capacity as a party to such agreement separate and apart from its identity as an employer incurring liability for the employee tax and employer tax on the wages of its own employees. Thus, if a citizen of the United States performs services in employment for the domestic corporation and at any time within the same calendar year performs services covered by the agreement as an employee of one or more foreign subsidiaries named therein, the limitation on wages provided in section 3121(a) (1) has application separately as to the wages for employment performed in the employ of the domestic corporation and as to the remuneration for services covered by the agreement performed in the employ of such foreign subsidiary or subsidiaries. All services covered by the agreement whether performed in the employ of one or more than one such foreign subsidiary are regarded for purposes of the wage limitation as having been performed in the employ of the domestic corporation in its separate capacity as a party to the agreement. Similarly, any remuneration for such services which, if the services were performed in the United States, would be excluded from wages unless a certain amount of such remuneration is paid by a single employer within a specified period (for example, remuneration for agricultural labor) is regarded, for purposes of determining whether the domestic corporation incurs liability under its agreement with respect to such remuneration, as having been paid by the domestic corporation in its separate capacity as a party to the agreement. All remuneration received by an employee for services covered by the agreement is deemed, for purposes of the special credit or refund provisions contained in section 6413(c), to have been received from the domestic corporation as an employer in its separate capacity as a party to the agreement.</P>
