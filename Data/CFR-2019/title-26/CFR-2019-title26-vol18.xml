      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The regulations in this part 40 are designated “Excise Tax Procedural Regulations.” The regulations set forth administrative provisions relating to the excise taxes imposed by chapters 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, and 49 (except for the chapter 32 tax imposed by section 4181 (firearms tax) and the chapter 36 taxes imposed by sections 4461 (harbor maintenance tax) and 4481 (heavy vehicle use tax)), and to floor stocks taxes imposed on articles subject to any of these taxes. Chapter 31 relates to retail excise taxes; chapter 32 to manufacturers' excise taxes; chapter 33 to taxes imposed on communications services and air transportation; chapter 34 to taxes imposed on certain insurance policies; chapter 36 to taxes imposed on transportation by water; chapter 38 to environmental taxes; chapter 39 to taxes imposed on registration-required obligations; and chapter 49 to taxes imposed on indoor tanning services. References in this part to “taxes” also include references to the fees imposed by sections 4375 and 4376. See parts 43, 46, 48, 49, and 52 of this chapter for regulations relating to the imposition of tax.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">References to forms.</E> Any reference to a form in this part is also a reference to any other form designated for the same use by the Commissioner after October 22, 1992.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Definition of semimonthly period.</E> The term “semimonthly period” means the first 15 days of a calendar month (the “first semimonthly period”) or the <PRTPAGE P="6"/>portion of a calendar month following the 15th day of the month (the “second semimonthly period”).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effective/applicability date.</E> This part applies to returns that relate to periods beginning after March 31, 2013. For rules that apply before that date, see 26 CFR part 40 (revised as of April 1, 2013).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Returns.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Return required.</E> The return of any tax to which this part 40 applies must be made on Form 720, <E T="03">Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,</E> according to the instructions applicable to the form. The requirement for filing a return under this part 40 applies separately to each tax listed by IRS Number on Form 720. Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(1), an entry must be made on the line for the IRS Number in order to file a return of the tax corresponding to that number. The entry on an IRS Number line of the word “none,” “zero,” or comparable entry clearly indicating a denial of liability constitutes a return of that tax. The entry of the word “none” across the return or in the summary portion, provided it clearly indicates a denial of liability for all taxes, constitutes a return of all taxes listed on Form 720.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Period covered by return</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the return must be made for a period of one calendar quarter. A return must be filed for the first calendar quarter in which liability for tax is incurred (or in which tax must be collected and paid over) and for each subsequent calendar quarter, whether or not liability is incurred (or tax must be collected and paid over) during that subsequent quarter, until a final return under § 40.6011(a)-2 is filed. In the case of one-time filings (as defined in § 40.6011(a)-2(b)) and returns of floor stocks taxes under § 40.6011(a)-2(c), a first return is also a final return.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">First return.</E> A person's return is a first return if the person was not required under this part 40 to file a return (other than a final return) for the preceding period.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Floor stocks tax return.</E> A return reporting liability for a floor stocks tax described in § 40.0-1(a) is a return for the calendar quarter in which the tax payment is due and not the calendar quarter in which the liability for tax is incurred.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Person required to file the return.</E> Except in the case of a tax required to be collected and paid over, the person incurring liability for tax must file the return. In the case of a tax required to be collected and paid over, the person required to collect the tax (and not the person incurring liability) must file the return.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Monthly and semimonthly returns</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the district director determines that any person that is required under this section to file returns has failed to comply in a timely manner with the requirements of this part 40 relating to returns, payments, and deposits of tax, that person will be required, if so notified in writing by the district director, to make a return for a monthly or semimonthly period (as defined in § 40.0-1(c)). Each person so notified by the district director must make a return for the calendar month or semimonthly period in which the notice is received and for each calendar month or semimonthly period thereafter until the person has filed a final return or until the person is notified by the district director to resume making quarterly returns.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Certain persons liable for tax on taxable fuel.</E> The district director may require a person to make a return of tax for a monthly or semimonthly period in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the person—</P>
            <P>(i) Is a bonded registrant (as defined in § 48.4101-1(b) of this chapter) at any time during the period;</P>
            <P>(ii) Has been registered under section 4101 for less than one year at the beginning of the period;</P>
            <P>(iii) Meets the acceptable risk test of § 48.4101-1(f)(3) of this chapter by reason of § 48.4101-1(f)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter at any time during the period;</P>

            <P>(iv) Has failed to comply with the applicable provisions of § 48.4101-1(h) of this chapter (relating to the terms and conditions of registration);<PRTPAGE P="7"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) Is liable for tax under § 48.4082-4(a) of this chapter (relating to the back-up tax on diesel fuel and kerosene) at any time during the period; or</P>
            <P>(vi) Is liable for tax under section 4081 (relating to the tax on taxable fuel) at any time during the period and is not registered under section 4101 at that time.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees on health insurance policies and self-insured health plans</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A return that reports liability imposed by section 4375 or 4376 is a return for policies or plans with policy or plan years ending in the previous calendar year, and, for issuers that determine the average number of lives covered under a policy for purposes of section 4375 using the member months method under § 46.4375-1(c)(2)(v) or the state form method under § 46.4375-1(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter, the return is for all policies in effect during the previous calendar year. The second sentence of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section (relating to filing quarterly returns regardless of whether liability is incurred) does not apply to a person that files a Form 720, “Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,” only to report liability imposed by section 4375 or 4376.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicability date.</E> This paragraph (c) applies to returns that report liability imposed by section 4375 or 4376.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Final returns.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Permanent cessation of operations.</E> Any person that is required under § 40.6011(a)-1 to make returns and that permanently ceases all operations with respect to which liability for tax was incurred (or with respect to which tax had to be collected and paid over) must make a final return in accordance with the instructions applicable to the form on which the return is made. A person does not make a final return if only a temporary or partial cessation of such operations occurs and must continue to file returns as required under § 40.6011(a)-1.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Change in law without cessation of operations.</E> Any person that is required under § 40.6011(a)-1 to make returns must make a final return in accordance with the instructions applicable to the form on which the return is made if, by reason of a change in law, that person is no longer liable for any tax (or, in the case of a collected tax, is no longer responsible for collecting and paying over any tax). For example, if the tax on a product is changed from a retail tax to a manufacturers tax, a retailer formerly liable for the tax but now buying the product tax-paid from its supplier must make a final return (assuming that the retailer has no other tax liability reportable on the return).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Special rule for one-time filings</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A first return is also a final return if it is a one-time filing. A return is a one-time filing if the person reporting tax does not engage in any activity with respect to which tax is reportable on the return in the course of a trade or business.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposits not required.</E> See § 40.6302(c)-1(e)(2) for a rule providing that no deposit of taxes reported on a one-time filing is required.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Special rule for floor stocks taxes.</E> A first return reporting only floor stocks taxes under this part 40 is also a final return.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Deposits under chapter 33.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This section sets forth an alternative method for computing the amount of deposits of taxes imposed by chapter 33, and provides rules relating to the time for making a deposit and the amount of tax to be reported on the return of tax for each quarter by persons using the alternative method. The safe harbor rules for computing deposits of tax using the alternative method and the general rules relating to deposits are set forth in § 40.6302(c)-1 and apply unless inconsistent with the rules set forth below.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternative method for computing deposits</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general</E>—(i) <E T="03">Alternative method.</E> Any person required to collect and pay over any tax imposed by chapter 33 may compute the amount of that tax to be deposited on the basis of amounts considered as collected (the “alternative method”) instead of on the basis of actual collections of tax.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Using more than one method to compute deposits.</E> A person may compute deposits of tax imposed by one or more sections of chapter 33 using the alternative method provided by this section and compute deposits of taxes imposed by other sections of chapter 33 on the basis of amounts actually collected using the rule of § 40.6302(c)-1(c)(1). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), the taxes imposed by section 4261(a) and (b) are treated as taxes imposed by the same section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicability</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A person may use the alternative method with respect to a tax only if the person—</P>
            <P>(A) Separately accounts for the tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(B) Makes a return of the tax on the basis of the amount of the tax that is considered as collected.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Separate account.</E> The account required under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section (the separate account)—</P>
            <P>(A) Must reflect for each month all items of tax that are included in amounts billed or tickets sold to customers during the month;</P>
            <P>(B) May not reflect an item of adjustment for any month during a quarter if the adjustment results from a refusal to pay or inability to collect the tax and the uncollected tax has not been reported under § 49.4291-1 of this chapter on or before the due date of the return for that quarter; and</P>
            <P>(C) Must reflect for each month items of adjustment (including bad debts and errors) relating to the tax for prior months within the period of limitations on credits or refunds.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Change of method.</E> The method of computing deposits of tax imposed by a section of chapter 33 (as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) may be changed only at the beginning of a calendar quarter. Before a person changes the method used to compute the amount of tax to be deposited and reported for a calendar quarter, the person must notify the Commissioner so that proper adjustments may be made in order to properly reflect that person's collections of excise tax.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Period during which tax is considered as collected.</E> For purposes of this section, the tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold during a semimonthly period (as defined in § 40.0-1(c)) is considered as collected during the first seven days of the second following semimonthly period. Thus, the tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold during the first semimonthly period of a calendar month is considered as collected during the period of the 1st day through the 7th day of the following month; the tax included in amounts billed or tickets sold during the second semimonthly period of a calendar month is considered as collected during the period of the 16th day through the 22nd day of the following month.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">When amounts are billed.</E> For purposes of this section, an amount is billed on the earlier of the date the amount is received or the date a bill for the amount is rendered.<PRTPAGE P="13"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time to deposit.</E> Under the alternative method, the deposit of tax for any semimonthly period must be made by the third business day after the seventh day of that semimonthly period. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a “business day” is any calendar day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The term <E T="03">legal holiday</E> means a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as defined in section 7503. Thus, for example, the deposit for the semimonthly period beginning on January 1, 2011 (relating to amounts billed between December 1st and December 15, 2010) is due by January 12, 2011, three business days after January 7, the seventh day of the semimonthly period. The deposit for the semimonthly period beginning on October 1, 2011 (relating to amounts billed between September 1st and September 15, 2011), is due by October 13, 2011, due to the October 10, 2011, Columbus Day holiday.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Computation of net amount of tax that is considered as collected during a semimonthly period.</E> The net amount of tax that is considered as collected during the semimonthly period must be either the net amount of tax reflected in the separate account for the corresponding semimonthly period of the preceding month or one-half the net amount of tax reflected in the separate account for the preceding month.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Reporting of tax.</E> If a tax is deposited under the alternative method for a calendar quarter, the return of tax for the quarter must report the net amount of the tax that is considered as collected during the quarter and not the amount of the tax that is actually collected during the quarter. The amount to be reported for each month is the net amount of tax reflected in the separate account for the preceding month. For example, amounts billed in December, January, and February are considered as collected during January, February, and March, and are reported as the collections of tax for January, February, and March (the first calendar quarter). Thus, the net amount of tax reflected in the separate accounts for December, January, and February is the amount reported as collections for the first quarter.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Special rules for September</E>—(1) <E T="03">Deposits required.</E> In the case of alternative method taxes charged (that is, included in amounts billed or tickets sold) during the first semimonthly period in September, separate deposits are required for the taxes charged during the period September 1st-11th and the period September 12th-15th.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Time to deposit</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The deposit required for alternative method taxes charged during the period beginning September 1st must be made by September 29. The deposit required for alternative method taxes charged during the period ending September 15th must be made at the time prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section for making deposits for the first semimonthly period in October.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Due date on Saturday or Sunday.</E> A deposit that would otherwise be due on September 29 must be made by September 28 if September 29 is a Saturday and by September 30 if September 29 is a Sunday.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of deposit.</E> The deposits of alternative method taxes required for the period September 1st-11th and the period September 12th-15th must be not less than the amount of alternative method taxes charged during the respective periods. The amount of alternative method taxes charged during these periods may be computed by—</P>
            <P>(i) Determining the net amount of alternative method taxes reflected in the separate account for the first semimonthly period in September (or one-half of the net amount of alternative method taxes reasonably expected to be reflected in the separate account for the month of September);</P>
            <P>(ii) Treating <FR>11/15</FR> of that amount as the amount of taxes charged during the period September 1st-11th; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Treating the remainder of the amount determined under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section (adjusted, if that amount is based on reasonable expectations, to reflect actual taxes charged through the end of September) as the amount charged during the period September 12th-15th.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Safe harbor rule based on look-back quarter liability.</E> The safe harbor rule of § 40.6302(c)-1(b)(2) does not apply for the fourth calendar quarter unless—</P>

            <P>(i) The deposit for alternative method taxes charged during the period September 1st-11th is not less than <FR>11/90</FR> of <PRTPAGE P="14"/>the net tax liability reported for alternative method taxes for the look-back quarter; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The total deposit for alternative method taxes charged during the first semimonthly period in September is not less than <FR>1/6</FR> of the net tax liability reported for alternative method taxes for the look-back quarter.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Persons not required to use electronic funds transfer.</E> In the case of a person that is not required to deposit excise taxes by electronic funds transfer (a non-EFT depositor), the rules of this paragraph (f) apply with the following modifications:</P>
            <P>(i) The taxes for which separate deposits must be made are the taxes charged during the periods September 1st-10th and September 11th-15th.</P>
            <P>(ii) The deposit required for taxes charged during the period beginning September 1st must be made by September 28. A deposit that would otherwise be due on September 28 must be made by September 27 if September 28 is a Saturday and by September 29 if September 28 is a Sunday.</P>
            <P>(iii) The generally applicable fractions and percentage are modified to reflect the different deposit periods in accordance with the following table:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Imposition and computation of tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Tax is imposed on the use during a taxable period of any registered highway motor vehicle that (together with the semitrailers and trailers customarily used in connection with highway motor vehicles of the same type as such highway motor vehicle) has a taxable gross weight of at least 55,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate of tax.</E> For the rate of tax generally, see section 4481(a). For the rate of tax for certain vehicles used in logging, see section 4483(e). For a special rule for the taxable period in which the tax terminates, see section 4482(d).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Computation of tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the tax on the use of a particular highway motor vehicle for a taxable period is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For vehicles with a taxable gross weight of at least 55,000 pounds, but not over 75,000 pounds, add to $100 an amount equal to $22 for each 1,000 pounds (or fraction thereof) in excess of 55,000 pounds; and</P>
              <P>(ii) For vehicles with a taxable gross weight over 75,000 pounds, the tax is $550.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Certain prorated taxable periods.</E> If the first taxable use of a particular highway motor vehicle is made after the first month of the taxable period, the tax on the use of such vehicle for such taxable period is computed by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period as computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, by a fraction. Such fraction shall have as its numerator the number of months in the taxable period beginning with the month of first taxable use and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. For purposes of determining the fraction, any part of a month is counted as a full month. (See example (2) of paragraph (e) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Increase in taxable gross weight during the taxable period.</E> If the taxable gross weight of a vehicle increases during the month in which the vehicle is first used in a taxable period, the tax <PRTPAGE P="17"/>for the vehicle for the taxable period is computed on the basis of the increased weight. If the taxable gross weight of a vehicle increases after the month in which the vehicle was first used in a taxable period, the additional tax liability, if any, that results from the increased weight is calculated according to the following formula:</P>

The fraction has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in the period in which the first taxable use of the highway motor vehicle occurs to and including the last day of the month in which the highway motor vehicle was sold, destroyed, or stolen, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. (See paragraph (d) <E T="03">Example</E> (3)(i) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Overpayment.</E> If a taxpayer's liability for the tax on the use of a highway vehicle for a taxable period is determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, any tax the taxpayer paid under section 4481(a) on the use of the vehicle for such period in excess of the tax calculated under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section is an overpayment of tax.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Definition of destroyed vehicle.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), a highway motor vehicle is destroyed if the vehicle is damaged due to an accident or other casualty to such an extent that it is not economical to rebuild.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Form and content of claim.</E> A claim for refund of an overpayment described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section must be made on Form 8849, “Claim for Refund of Excise Taxes” (or such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions for that form. A claim for a credit must be made on Form 2290, “Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Return” (or such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions for that form. A claim for refund or credit for any vehicle must include—</P>
              <P>(A) The vehicle identification number and taxable gross weight of the vehicle;</P>
              <P>(B) The date of the sale, destruction, or theft of the vehicle; and</P>
              <P>(C) If the vehicle was sold, the name and address of the purchaser of the vehicle.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Tax on buyer's use of second-hand vehicles.</E> If a vehicle is sold during the taxable period and a credit or refund of the tax imposed by section 4481 is allowable upon the sale under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, tax is imposed on the use of the vehicle after the sale <PRTPAGE P="18"/>and before the end of the taxable period. (See paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section for the rules regarding the computation of tax after the sale and before the end of the taxable period.)</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Computation of tax on second-hand vehicles.</E> The tax under paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section on the use of a vehicle after a sale upon which a credit or refund is allowable is computed by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period as computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by a fraction. The fraction has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in which the first taxable use of the vehicle after the sale occurs (the first day of the month after such month if the first taxable use after the sale occurs in the month of the sale) through the end of the taxable period, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. (See paragraph (d) <E T="03">Example</E> (3)(ii) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Decrease in taxable gross weight, discontinued use, or converted use.</E> The computation of the tax is not affected, and no right to a credit or refund of any tax paid under section 4481 arises, if in any taxable period—</P>
              <P>(i) The taxable gross weight of a highway motor vehicle is decreased;</P>
              <P>(ii) The use of a highway motor vehicle is discontinued (for reasons other than sale, destruction, or theft as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section); or</P>
              <P>(iii) The highway motor vehicle is converted to a use that is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4481(a).</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
                <P>In the taxable period beginning July 1, 1984, the first taxable use of a particular highway motor vehicle, a bus, having a taxable gross weight of 56,000 pounds, occurs on July 10, 1984, at which time the vehicle is registered in the name of X. A tax of $122 ($100 + $22) is imposed on X for the use of such vehicle for such taxable period.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>
                <P>On July 1, 1984, X has registered in his name a highway motor vehicle having a taxable gross weight of 60,000 pounds. The vehicle is in “dead storage” until August 10, 1984, at which time X starts using the vehicle on the public highways in carrying on his trucking business. On August 10, 1984, the vehicle is still registered in X's name. Since the first taxable use of this highway motor vehicle during the taxable period occurred on August 10, 1984, X is required to pay a tax of $192.50 ([$100 + (5 × $22)] × 11/12) for such taxable period.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (3).</HD>
                <P>(i) In July, X uses a vehicle that is registered in X's name and has a taxable gross weight of 70,000 pounds. The vehicle is not a logging vehicle. X pays the $430 of tax imposed by section 4481 for the taxable period. On September 2 of the same calendar year, X sells the vehicle to Y. X's tax is calculated under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period by a fraction that has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in which X's first taxable use of the highway motor vehicle occurs to and including the last day of the month in which the vehicle was sold, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. Thus, X's tax for the period is $107.50 (3/12 of $430), and X may claim a credit or refund of $322.50 ($430.00−$107.50) in accordance with § 41.4481-1(c)(4)(v) after X sells the vehicle.</P>
                <P>(ii) On September 23, Y uses the vehicle. Y is liable for tax on the use of the vehicle during the taxable period ending June 30 of the following calendar year. Y's tax is calculated under paragraph (c)(4)(vii) by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period by a fraction that has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in which Y's first taxable use of the vehicle after the sale occurs (the first day of the month after such month if the first taxable use after the sale occurs in the month of the sale) through the end of the taxable period, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. Y's first use of the vehicle occurs in the month of the sale. Accordingly, Y's tax is based on the number of months in the period from the first day of October (the month following the month of the first taxable use) through the end of June, and Y owes a section 4481 tax of $322.50 (9/12 of $430) for the taxable period.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (4).</HD>
                <P>Assume the same facts as in <E T="03">Example</E> (3)(i), except that on September 2, X sells the vehicle to Dealer, a dealer in highway motor vehicles. X may claim a credit or refund of $322.50. Dealer operates the vehicle exclusively for the purpose of demonstration, which is not a “use” of the vehicle under § 41.4482(c)-1(c). On May 2 of the following calendar year, Dealer sells the vehicle to Y. Dealer does not owe a section 4481 tax and may not claim a refund. Y's first taxable use of the vehicle occurs on May 3. Y's first taxable use of the vehicle does not occur in the <PRTPAGE P="19"/>month of a sale upon which a credit or refund is allowable. Accordingly, Y's tax is calculated under paragraph (c)(2) by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period by a fraction which has as its numerator the number of months in the taxable period beginning with the month of first taxable use and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. The numerator is the number of months in the period from the first day of May (the month of Y's first taxable use after the sale) through the end of June, and Y owes a section 4481 tax of $71.67 (2/12 of $430) for the taxable period.</P>

In the case of a highway motor vehicle that is registered in at least one State that requires a declaration of gross weight to be stated as a specific amount for any purpose (including proportional or prorate registration or the payment of any other fees or taxes), the taxable gross weight of such vehicle must be no less than the highest gross weight declaration (or combined gross weight declaration in the case of a tractor-trailer or truck-trailer combination) made by the registrant in any State with respect to such vehicle. If a highway motor vehicle is registered in at least one State that requires vehicles to register on the basis of gross weight and such vehicle is not registered in any State that requires a declaration of gross weight to be stated as a specific amount by the registrant, the taxable gross weight of such vehicle must fall within the highest gross weight category of such State for which such vehicle is registered during the taxable period.

                <P>A is the owner of a truck-tractor. On January 1, 1985, A registers the truck-tractor in three states—X, Y, and Z. For purposes of registering the vehicle in State X, A declares the gross operating weight of his truck-tractor to be 60,000 pounds. The declaration of the gross weight of the vehicle at 50,000 pounds places A's truck-tractor in the State X registration category of 55,000 to 62,000 pounds gross weight. Thus, the registered weight of A's vehicle in State X is 62,000 pounds. At the same time as A registers the vehicle in State X, A also proportionally registers the vehicle under the IRP in State Y. A uses the same declared gross weight of 60,000 pounds for purposes of the State Y proportional registration. Registration in State Y at this declared gross weight places A's truck-tractor in the State Y gross weight registration category of 58,000 to 68,000 pounds. Finally, A registers the truck-tractor in State Z. Registration of vehicles in State Z is based on the unladen weight of the vehicle. During the taxable period beginning on July 1, 1985, A's truck-tractor is not registered in any other state. For the taxable period beginning on July 1, 1985, A must declare a taxable gross weight of no less than 60,000 pounds for purposes of the tax imposed by section 4481(a) because that is the highest declared gross weight for state registration or other purposes. Should A declare to any State agency a higher gross operating weight with respect to the truck-tractor during the same taxable period (except for a special temporary permit), A would then be liable for additional tax as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of § 41.4481-1.</P>

                <P>Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that on one occasion during the taxable period, A was issued a special 2-day permit to use his truck-tractor in State Y to haul a load which would give A's unit a total gross weight of 80,000 pounds. A may still declare the taxable gross weight of <PRTPAGE P="22"/>his unit to be no less than 60,000 pounds because special permits to haul heavier loads on a temporary basis are not considered in determining the taxable gross weight of a vehicle.</P>

The second vehicle is registered only in State Y at a registered weight of 68,000 pounds based on a declared gross weight of 65,000 pounds. No other declarations of gross weight are made with respect to either vehicle. For purposes of the Federal heavy vehicle use tax, the taxable gross weight of the vehicle registered in State X may be declared at no less than 70,000 pounds and the taxable gross weight of the vehicle registered in State Y may be declared at no less than 65,000 pounds even though the vehicles are identical.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Taxable period.</E> For the definition of <E T="03">taxable period,</E> see section 4482(c).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use.</E> The term “use”, as used in the regulations in this part with reference to a highway motor vehicle, means the use of the highway motor vehicle on the public highways in the United States, that is, operation of the vehicle, by means of its own motor, on any roadway (whether a Federal highway, State highway, city street, or otherwise) in the United States which is not a private roadway. Thus, for purposes of the tax, there is no use of a highway motor vehicle while the vehicle is in “dead storage”. The term “use” does not include operation of a new highway motor vehicle on a public highway in the United States if such operation is merely for the purpose of transporting the vehicle from the point of manufacture or assembly to the consumer, whether direct or with intermediate deliveries to such points as are involved in the distribution process. For example, operation of a new vehicle for the purpose of delivering it from the factory to a branch establishment of the manufacturer, or from the factory or branch establishment to a dealer, distributor, or consumer, does not constitute use of the vehicle within the meaning of the regulations in this part; likewise, the further operation of the vehicle by a dealer or distributor for the purpose of delivering the vehicle to a consumer does not constitute use of the vehicle. Similarly, the operation of a secondhand highway motor vehicle by a dealer or distributor for the purpose of delivering the vehicle to a purchaser does not constitute use of the vehicle within the meaning of the regulations in this part. Furthermore, the term “use” does not include operation of a new or secondhand highway motor vehicle, if such operation is exclusively for the purpose of demonstration of the vehicle by a dealer in, or distributor of, new or secondhand highway motor vehicles. Operation of a highway motor vehicle on a private roadway, or other private property, does not constitute use of the vehicle within the meaning of the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Customarily used.</E> A semitrailer or trailer is treated as <E T="03">customarily used</E> in connection with a highway motor vehicle if the vehicle is equipped to tow the semitrailer or trailer.</P>

              <P>Use of a highway motor vehicle by a State is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4481. For this purpose, the term <E T="03">use by a State</E> means the operation by a State on the public highways in the United States of any highway motor vehicle, whether or not such highway motor vehicle is owned by the State.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemption for certain transit-type buses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Use in any taxable period, or part thereof, of any bus of the <PRTPAGE P="23"/>transit type by any person who is engaged in the operation of a transit system is exempt from the tax, if such person meets the 60-percent passenger fare revenue test provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, for the applicable period prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section as the test period for such person for such system for such taxable period, or part thereof.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Buses of the transit type.</E> The term “transit type”, when used in the regulations in this part with reference to a bus, means the type of bus which is designed for the mass transportation of persons within an urban area, as distinguished from the intercity-type bus. A transit-type bus is ordinarily distinguishable from an intercity-type bus by comparison of seats, doors, and baggage facilities. The transit-type bus usually has straight-back seats of the bench type, while the intercity-type bus generally has seats which either can be reclined or are in fact permanently fixed in a reclining position. The transit-type bus is more likely to have an accordion or folding-type door at the front of the bus, and often has a second door in the middle or at the rear for passengers to leave the bus, as opposed to the emergency-type rear door which may or may not be included in the intercity-type bus. The typical transit-type bus does not have facilities for storing baggage whereas the typical intercity-type bus has facilities for storing baggage in a compartment underneath the floor of the bus or in overhead racks, or both. Other characteristics which may be taken into account in distinguishing a transit-type bus from an intercity-type bus include gear ratios, acceleration and maximum speed, and aisle space for standees. The transit-type bus ordinarily has a lower gear ratio to provide for quick starts and because, in general, buses of this type are operated at low speeds. The intercity-type bus ordinarily has a higher gear ratio and can be operated at much higher speeds. The transit-type bus usually has wider aisles, with overhead straps or bars to accommodate standees.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test period.</E> (1) In the case of any person who is engaged in the operation of a transit system at any time in the calendar quarter immediately preceding July 1 of any taxable period, the test period for such system for such taxable period shall be such calendar quarter. However, if passenger fare revenue from scheduled service described in paragraph (e) of this section was derived on less than 30 days during such calendar quarter from operation of such system, the test period for such system for such taxable period shall be the last preceding test period for such system. If such system has no preceding test period, then the test period for such system for such taxable period shall be the calendar quarter beginning with July 1 of such taxable period.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, in the case of any person who commences operation of a transit system at any time on or after July 1 of any taxable period the test period for such system for that part of such taxable period beginning with the first day on which such operation was commenced shall be the calendar quarter in which falls such first day. However, if passenger fare revenue from scheduled service described in paragraph (e) of this section was derived on less than 30 days during such calendar quarter from operation of such system, the test period for such system for such taxable period shall be the following calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of any person who commences operation of a transit system at any time in the last calendar quarter to which the tax imposed by section 4481 applies, such last calendar quarter shall be the test period for such transit system regardless of the number of days in which passenger fare revenue is derived in such calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transit system.</E> The term “transit system”, as used in the regulations in this part, means any system for furnishing scheduled common carrier public passenger land transportation service along regular routes.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">60-percent passenger fare revenue test.</E> For purposes of this section, a person engaged in the operation of a transit system meets the 60-percent passenger fare revenue test, for the applicable test period prescribed in this section, if:<PRTPAGE P="24"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) During such test period such person derived passenger fare revenue from the operation of such system, and</P>
              <P>(2) At least 60 percent of the total of such passenger fare revenue derived by such person during such test period was attributable to (i) amounts paid for transportation which do not exceed 60 cents, (ii) amounts paid for commutation or season tickets for single trips of less than 30 miles, or (iii) amounts paid for commutation tickets for one month or less. In determining the total of such passenger fare revenue, revenue from sources such as charter fees, rentals of property, advertising receipts, etc., is not taken into account.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
                <P>The X Transit Company is engaged in the operation of a transit system in the city of A and surrounding area throughout April, May, and June of 1984 and the taxable period beginning July 1, 1984. It derives passenger fare revenue from the operation of such system for 15 days in April and for the entire months of May and June of 1984. On July 1, 1984, the Company is using 60 buses of the transit type and 40 buses of the intercity type. Each of 20 of the transit-type buses and each of 10 of the intercity-type buses has a taxable gross weight of less than 55,000 pounds. (No tax is imposed on the use of either a transit-type bus or an intercity-type bus having a taxable gross weight of less than 55,000 pounds. See § 41.4481-1.) Use of the 10 intercity-type buses is subject to the tax for the taxable period beginning with July 1, 1984, since the exemption, if any, applies only to transit-type buses. Use of the 20 transit-type buses is not subject to the tax for such taxable period if at least 60 percent of the total passenger fare revenue derived by the X Transit Company during April, May, and June of 1984 (the test period prescribed in paragraph (c) (1) of this section) from operation of such system was from fares attributable to (i) amounts paid for transportation which do not exceed 60 cents, (ii) amounts paid for commutation or season tickets for single trips of less than 30 miles, or (iii) amounts paid for commutation tickets for one month or less. If the X Transit Company does not meet the 60-percent passenger fare revenue test for April, May, and June of 1984, the tax attaches for the taxable period beginning with July 1, 1984, with respect to the use of each of the 20 transit-type buses having a taxable gross weight of more than less than 55,000 pounds.</P>

In such case, the test period is July, August, and September of 1984, and if the test is met for this period, no tax is imposed on the use by the Company of any bus of the transit type in the period July 15, 1984, through June 30, 1985.</P>

              <P>(B) Registered (under the laws of the State or States in which such vehicle is required to be registered) as a highway motor vehicle used for farming purposes.</P>
              <FP>A highway motor vehicle is used primarily for farming purposes if more than one-half of such vehicle's use (determined on the basis of mileage) during the taxable period is for farming purposes. Further, the highway motor vehicle must be registered (under the laws of the State or States where such vehicle is required to be registered) as a highway motor vehicle used for farming purposes for the entire taxable period in order to qualify as an agricultural vehicle. See § 41.4482(a)-(1) for the definition of “highway motor vehicle”. A vehicle will be considered to be registered under the laws of the State as a highway motor vehicle used for farming purposes if such vehicle is so registered under a State statute or legally valid regulations. In addition, no special tag or license plate identifying a vehicle as being used for farming purposes is required.</FP>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Farming purposes.</E> For purposes of this section, “farming purposes” means the transporting of any farm commodity to or from a farm, or the use directly in agricultural production.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Farm commodity.</E> A “farm commodity” is any agricultural or horticultural commodity, feed, seed, fertilizer, livestock, bees, poultry, fur-bearing animals, or wildlife. A farm commodity does not include a commodity which has been changed by a processing operation from its raw or natural state. For example, juice which has been extracted from fruits or vegetables is not a farm commodity for purposes of this paragraph (g).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Farm.</E> The term “farm” includes stock (including feed yards for fattening cattle), dairy, poultry, fruit, fur-bearing animal, and truck farms, plantations, ranches, nurseries, ranges, orchards, and such greenhouses and other similar structures as are used primarily for the raising of any agricultural or horticultural commodity. Greenhouses and other similar structures used primarily for purposes other than the raising of agricultural or horticultural commodities (for example, display, storage, or fabrication of wreaths, corsages, and bouquets) do not constitute “farms”.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Agricultural production</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> A highway motor vehicle is considered to be used directly in agricultural production only if it is used as indicated in the following paragraphs.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Use of a highway motor vehicle in connection with cultivating, raising, and harvesting.</E> A highway motor vehicle is considered to be used directly in agricultural production if such vehicle is used in connection with cultivating the soil, or raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training and management of livestock, bees, poultry, and fur-bearing animals and wildlife. A highway motor vehicle which is used in connection with operations such as canning, freezing, packaging, or other processing operations will not be considered to be used directly in agricultural production.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Use of a highway motor vehicle in connection with planting, cultivation, caring for, cutting, etc., of trees.</E> A highway motor vehicle is used directly for agricultural production if it is used in connection with planting, cultivating, caring for, or cutting of trees, or in connection with the preparation (other than milling) of trees for market; but only if such operations are incidental to farming operations. These farming operations include felling trees and cutting them into logs or firewood, but do not include sawing logs into lumber, chipping, or other milling operations. The operations specified in this paragraph (g)(2)(v)(C) will be considered “incidental to farming operations” only if they are of a minor nature in comparison with the total farming operations involved. Therefore, a treefarmer or timbergrower may not <PRTPAGE P="27"/>claim that a highway motor vehicle used in that trade or business is used directly in agricultural production.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Use of a highway motor vehicle in connection with the operation, management, conservation, improvement, or maintenance of a farm.</E> A highway motor vehicle is used directly for agricultural production if it is used in connection with the operation, management, conservation, improvement, or maintenance of a farm and its tools and equipment. Examples of these operations include clearing land, repairing fences and farm buildings, building terraces or irrigation ditches, cleaning tools or farm machinery, painting, and other activities which contribute in any way to the conduct of a farm as such, as distinguished from any other enterprise in which the owner of the highway motor vehicle may be engaged.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Mileage on farm not counted toward 7,500 mile limit.</E> For purposes of this section, the number of miles which a highway motor vehicle is driven on a farm and not on the public highways shall not be taken into account when determining whether the vehicle's mileage is in excess of 7,500 miles. Accurate records should be kept by taxpayers of the number of miles that a highway motor vehicle is operated on a farm.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Owner.</E> For purposes of this section the term “owner” means, with respect to any highway motor vehicle, the person described in section 4481(b).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application of exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Any exemption from the tax on the use of a highway motor vehicle has application only with respect to the use of such highway motor vehicle and not with respect to the highway motor vehicle as such. Furthermore, such exemption is subject to those provisions of paragraph (c) of § 41.4481-1 relating to proration of the tax and to the effect of an exempt use of a highway motor vehicle after a taxable use has been made. Thus, if a taxable use is made of a highway motor vehicle at any time in a taxable period, the tax is imposed on the use of such vehicle for such taxable period, computed from the first day of the month in which such taxable use occurred, even though at some time in the same taxable period, before or after such taxable use occurred, the use of the vehicle may have been, or may be, exempt. For example, if a highway motor vehicle is operated exclusively by a State in the period July 1 through September 10 of a taxable period, use of such vehicle in such period is exempt from the tax. However, if a taxable use of the vehicle is made on September 11 of such taxable period, the tax imposed on the use of such vehicle for such taxable period is computed from September 1. On the other hand, if a taxable use of the vehicle is made at any time in July of the taxable period, the tax imposed on the use of such vehicle for such taxable period is computed from July 1, even though the vehicle may be operated exclusively by a State in every other month of such period.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Truck used in logging.</E> The term “truck used in logging” means any highway motor vehicle which—</P>
              <P>(1) Is used exclusively during the taxable period for the transportation, to and from a point located on a forested site, of products harvested from such forested site, and</P>
              <P>(2) Is registered (under the laws of the State or States in which such vehicle is required to be registered) as a highway motor vehicle used exclusively in the transportation of harvested forest products.</P>

              <FP>Products harvested from the forested site may include timber which has been processed for commercial use by sawing into lumber, chipping or other milling operations if such processing occurs prior to transportation from the forested site. A vehicle will be considered to be registered under the laws of <PRTPAGE P="28"/>a state as a highway motor vehicle used exclusively in the transportation of harvested forest products if such vehicle is so registered under a state statute or legally valid regulations. In addition, no special tag or license plate identifying a vehicle as being used in the transportation of harvested forest products is required.</FP>

              <P>(6) In the case of any such vehicle disposed of otherwise than by sale or other transfer (including disposition by theft or destruction), the date and method of disposition of the vehicle.</P>
              <P>(7) In the case of a secondhand highway motor vehicle acquired at any time in the taxable period, evidence showing whether there was a prior taxable use in such taxable period of the highway motor vehicle (see paragraph (b) of § 41.4481-2) or whether there was a suspension of tax in effect (see § 41.4483-3).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Proof of payment for State registration purposes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> This section sets forth the circumstances under which a State must require proof of payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a), and the required manner in which such proof of payment is to be received by the State as a condition of issuing a registration for a highway motor vehicle. A State must either comply with the provisions of this section or, in the alternative, comply with such other rules regarding the satisfaction of this proof of payment requirement as may be prescribed by the Commissioner (by Revenue Procedure or otherwise), in order to avoid a reduction of Federal-aid highway funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(4). For purposes of this section, the rules of section 7502 and § 301.7502-1 of this chapter (relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing) determine when an application for registration is considered to be received by a State.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proof of payment required</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E>— A State to which an application is made to register a highway motor vehicle must receive from the registrant proof of payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a) (or proof of suspension of such tax under § 41.4483-3) unless otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(1), or paragraph (b)(2) or (5) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section for the meaning of “proof of payment”. Such proof of payment must be received by the State before the State issues a registration for such vehicle unless the State is using a system of registration provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The term “proof of payment”, when used in this section, shall be considered to refer in appropriate cases to proof of suspension of the tax imposed by section 4481(a). Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, any proof of payment presented to a State must relate to tax paid (or suspended under § 41.4483-3) for the taxable period which includes the date that the State receives the application for registration. A “base state” must be presented proof of payment when issuing an “apportioned plate” under the International Registration Plan (IRP) (or similar agreement) for a highway motor vehicle, but no proof of payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a) is required to be presented to the other states for which the vehicle is proportionally registered and which are listed on the IRP cab card issued by the base state. Further, a State is not required to receive proof of payment in order to issue special temporary travel permits which allow a vehicle to, (i) operate in a State in which the vehicle is not registered (including proportional or prorate registration), (ii) operate at more than the State's maximum statutory weight limit, or (iii) operate at more than the weight that the vehicle is registered in a State. Further, a State may register a highway motor vehicle without proof of payment if the person registering the vehicle presents the original or a photocopy of a bill of sale (or other document evidencing transfer) indicating that the vehicle was purchased by the owner either as a new or used vehicle during the preceding 60 days before the date that the State receives the application for registration of such vehicle.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">States required to receive proof of payment with respect to vehicles subject to tax</E>—(i) <E T="03">Registration in States that register vehicles on the basis of gross weight.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="30"/>A State that registers vehicles on the basis of gross weight must require proof of payment with respect to any highway motor vehicle that has a declared gross weight in that State of 55,000 pounds or more. If no declaration of a specific gross weight is made with respect to a highway motor vehicle registered on the basis of gross weight, then the State must require proof of payment with respect to such vehicle if the minimum weight of the registered weight category for such vehicle is 55,000 pounds or more. No such proof of payment is required for any vehicle that does not have a declared gross weight in that State of 55,000 pounds or more.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Registration in States that register vehicles other than on the basis of gross weight.</E> A State that registers vehicles other than on the basis of gross weight must require proof of payment in order to register a highway motor vehicle unless the State receives a written statement stating that during the taxable period which includes the date on which the State receives the application for registration, such vehicle had a taxable gross weight of less than 55,000 pounds. The written statement must state the number of vehicles being registered that have a taxable gross weight of less than 55,000 pounds and must be signed by the person registering the vehicles. A State may register a highway motor vehicle without receiving either proof of payment or a written statement as described above if such vehicle has an unladen weight of 8,000 pounds or less. However, the State must require proof of payment when issuing a “base plate” registration for a vehicle if a gross weight declaration of 55,000 pounds or more is made to the State with respect to such vehicle in order to proportionally register the vehicle in another State under the IRP.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">State may require additional proof.</E> Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a State from refusing to register a highway motor vehicle without additional proof that the vehicle is not subject to tax under section 4481(a) even though the person registering the vehicle submits a written statement declaring that the taxable gross weight of such vehicle is less than 55,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Suspension registration system.</E> A State may issue a registration with respect to any or all highway motor vehicles subject to tax under section 4481(a) without receiving proof of payment if such vehicles are registered under a “suspension” registration system. Registration of a vehicle subject to tax under a suspension system must be on the condition that, (i) the State receive proof of payment with respect to such vehicle no later than 4 months (or any lesser time to be determined by the State) after the beginning of the vehicle's registration period, and (ii) the State's system provides for the automatic suspension (<E T="03">e.g.</E> through the use of computer-generated notices) of such vehicle's registration if no proof of payment is received within the required time. Following such a suspension of registration, the State must not allow the vehicle to be registered until valid proof of payment is received. A State may either register all vehicles subject to tax under section 4481(a) in the manner described in this paragraph (b)(3) or adopt this manner of registration only in situations which the State deems appropriate. A State that registers vehicles other than on the basis of gross weight may also register vehicles not subject to tax under a suspension registration system for purposes of receiving the written statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Registration during certain months.</E> In the case of a highway motor vehicle subject to tax under section 4481(a) for which a State receives an application for registration during the months of July, August or September, proof of payment for the immediately preceding taxable period may be used to verify payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Registration in a State several times during the taxable period.</E> A State is required to receive proof of payment with respect to a highway motor vehicle subject to tax under section 4481(a) only once during a taxable period. Thus, in the case of a State that allows a highway motor vehicle to be registered on a quarterly basis, rather than annually, proof of payment will be required to be presented to the State only once during the taxable period. The State may designate any one <PRTPAGE P="31"/>of the four quarterly registration periods as the time for submitting proof of payment.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Proof of payment records.</E> See 23 CFR part 669 for a description of the supporting documentation and records that will be required by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in order to allow the FHWA to verify that the State is in compliance with the rules of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Proof of payment</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The proof of payment required in paragraph (b) of this section consists of a receipted Schedule 1 (Form 2290 “Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Return”) that is returned by the Internal Revenue Service, by mail or electronically, to a taxpayer that files a return of tax under section 4481(a), meets the requirements of § 41.6011(a)-1, and pays the amount of tax due with such return. A photocopy of such receipted Schedule 1 also serves as proof of payment. Such Schedule 1 serves as proof of suspension of such tax under § 41.4483-3 for the number of vehicles entered in that part of the Schedule 1 designated for vehicles for which tax has been suspended. The vehicle identification number of the vehicle being registered must appear on the Schedule 1 (or an attached page) in order for the Schedule 1 to be a valid proof of payment for such vehicle.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Acceptable substitute for receipted Schedule 1.</E> For purposes of this section, a State must accept as proof of payment a photocopy of the Form 2290 (with the Schedule 1 attached) that was filed with the Internal Revenue Service for the vehicle being registered with sufficient documentation of payment of tax due at the time the Form 2290 was filed (such as a photocopy of both sides of a cancelled check). This substitute proof of payment may be used to register a vehicle when, for example, the receipted Schedule 1 has been lost, or when at the time required for registration of a vehicle, a receipted Schedule 1 has not been received by a taxpayer who has filed a Form 2290 with respect to such vehicle.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
                <P>A applies to register a 3-axle single unit truck in State R, a member of the International Registration Plan, on November 1, 1985. State R registers vehicles based on unladen weight. At the same time, A applies for a proportional registration under the IRP to use the truck in State S. State S does not register vehicles on the basis of unladen weight. For purposes of the proportional registration in State S, A declares the gross weight of his truck at 50,000 pounds. A does not register the truck in any other states. A's truck has a taxable gross weight, as determined under § 41.4482(b)-1, of less than 55,000 pounds and therefore is not subject to tax under section 4481(a). A submits a written statement along with his application for registration in State R. The written statement states that A's vehicle has a taxable gross weight of less than 55,000 pounds and is signed by A. State R may register A's truck and issue a proportional registration for A to use his truck in State S without receiving proof of payment.</P>

                <P>Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that A applies for proportional registration under the IRP in State S and declares the truck to have a gross weight of 60,000 pounds. The taxable gross weight of A's truck, as determined under § 41.4482(b)-1 is 60,000 pounds. State R may not register A's truck unless it receives proof of payment within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

                <P>On October 10, 1985, C applies to register 9 vehicles in State U and declares the gross weight of each vehicle to be 70,000 pounds. C has not applied for registration in any other states. At the time of applying for registration, C presents a photocopy of a receipted Schedule 1 (Form 2290) that shows a total of 9 vehicles which are subject to tax under section 4481(a) and for which tax is not suspended under § 41.4483-3(a). The vehicle identification numbers of the vehicles that C is seeking to register must be listed on the Schedule 1 in order for State U to register the vehicles.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, proof of payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a) must be presented to United States Customs officials with respect to any highway motor vehicle subject to the tax imposed by section 4481(a) that has a base for registration purposes in a contiguous foreign country upon entry of such vehicle into the United States during any taxable period to which this section applies. Such proof of payment must relate to tax paid (or suspended under § 41.4483-3) for the taxable period that includes the date of entry into the United States. See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of the term “proof of payment.”</P>
              <P>(2) No proof of payment is required upon entry of a highway motor vehicle described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section into the United States if, as of the date of such entry, the period of time for filing a return of the tax imposed on such vehicle by section 4481(a) for the taxable period that includes the date of such entry has not expired and a written declaration is presented to United States Customs officials. Such declaration must state that, as of the date of such entry, the period of time for filing a return of the tax imposed on such vehicle by section 4481(a) for the taxable period that includes the date of such entry has not expired. The written declaration must include (i) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person liable under § 41.4481-2 for the tax imposed on such vehicle; (ii) the vehicle identification number of such vehicle; (iii) the date on which such vehicle was first used on the public highways in the United States during the taxable period (or a statement that the current entry is the first use on the public highways in the United States during the taxable period); (iv) an acknowledgment by the person liable for the tax imposed on such vehicle that the willful use of the declaration to evade or defeat the tax otherwise applicable under section 4481(a) will subject such person to a fine or imprisonment or both; and (v) the signature of the person liable for the tax imposed on such vehicle. A copy of the written declaration shall be retained in the records of the person liable for the tax imposed on such vehicle under the rules of § 41.6001-1. See § 41.6071(a)-1 for rules regarding the time for filing a return of the tax imposed by section 4481(a).</P>

A photocopy of such receipted Schedule 1 shall also serve as proof of payment. Such proof of payment shall also serve as proof or suspension of the tax under § 41.4483-3 for the number of vehicles entered in that part of the Schedule 1 designated for vehicles for which tax has been suspended. The vehicle identification number of any vehicle for which a return is being filed, whether tax is being paid with respect to such vehicle or tax is suspended on such vehicle, must appear on the Schedule 1 (or an attached page) in order for the Schedule 1 to be a valid proof of payment for such vehicle.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> For definitions of the terms “covered voyage” and “passenger vessel,” see sections 4472 (1) and (2).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Voyage.</E> For purposes of this section, “voyage” means a journey of a vessel that includes the outward and homeward trips or passages. The voyage commences when the vessel begins to load passengers and continues during the entire ensuing period until the vessel has made one outward and one homeward passage (including intermediate passages, if made). A voyage may be a covered voyage with respect to a passenger even if the passenger does not make both an outward and homeward passage or if the point of first embarkation or disembarkation by the passenger in the United States is an intermediate stop of the vessel.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Over 1 or more nights.</E> A voyage is considered to extend over 1 or more nights if it extends for more than 24 hours.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Engaged in gambling.</E> A passenger is engaged in gambling aboard a vessel if that person is participating as a player in any policy game or other lottery, or any other game of chance, for money or other thing of value, provided that the policy game, other lottery, or game of chance is conducted, sponsored, or operated by the owner or operator of the vessel, as either principal or agent, or by an employee, agent, or franchisee of the owner or operator of the vessel. A passenger is not engaged in gambling aboard a vessel if the passenger participates with other passengers in a casual, “friendly” game of chance that is not conducted, sponsored, or operated by the owner or operator of the vessel or by an employee, agent, or franchisee of the owner or operator.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Territorial waters.</E> For purposes of sections 4471 and 4472, the territorial waters of the United States are those waters within the international boundary line between the United States and any contiguous foreign country or within 3 nautical miles (3.45 statute miles) from low tide on the coastline. No inference is intended as to the extent of the territorial limits for other tax purposes.<PRTPAGE P="37"/>
            </P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Passenger.</E> For purposes of sections 4471 and 4472, “passenger” means an individual carried on the vessel except—</P>
            <P>(1) The Master; or</P>
            <P>(2) A crew member or other individual engaged in the business of the vessel or its owners. A person is engaged in the business of the vessel or its owners if the person is an employee of the vessel or her owners or has a duty, contractual or otherwise, to perform on the vessel on behalf of the vessel or its owners. For example, a person engaged as an entertainer, instructor, or lecturer for the benefit of the passengers is not a passenger, but a person on a promotional trip such as a travel agent or contest winner is a passenger even though the vessel or its owners may derive some future benefit from the promotion.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The regulations in this part are designated “Wagering Tax Regulations.” The regulations relate to the taxes imposed by Chapter 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, to certain general provisions of Chapter 40 of such Code, and to certain related administrative provisions of Subtitle F of such Code. Chapter 35 imposes an excise tax on wagers and a special tax to be paid by each person liable for the tax imposed on wagers and by each person engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person liable for the tax imposed on wagers. References in these regulations to the “Internal Revenue Code” or the “Code” are references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, unless otherwise indicated. References to a section or other provision of law are references to a section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, unless otherwise indicated.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Division of regulations.</E> The regulations in this part are divided into five subparts. Subpart A contains provisions relating to the arrangement and numbering of the sections of the regulations in this part, general definitions and use of terms, scope of the regulations, and the extent to which the regulations in this part supersede prior regulations relating to the taxes imposed by Chapter 35 of the Internal Revenue Code. Subpart B relates to the tax on wagers. Subpart C relates to the special tax. Subpart D relates to certain miscellaneous and general provisions having application to taxes imposed by Chapter 35. Subpart E relates to selected provisions of subtitle F of the Code (Procedure and Administration) which have special application to the taxes imposed by Chapter 35 of the Code.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Arrangement and numbering.</E> Each section of the regulations in this part (other than subpart A) is designated by a number composed of the part number followed by a decimal point (44.); the section of the Internal Revenue Code which it interprets; a hyphen (-); and a number identifying the section. By use of these designations one can ascertain the sections of the regulations relating to a provision of the Code. For example, the regulations pertaining to section 4401 of the Code are designated §§ 41.4401-1, 41.4401-2, and 41.4401-3.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Imposition of tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4401 imposes a tax on all wagers, as defined in section 4421. See section 4421 and § 44.4421-1 for definition of the term “wager.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate of tax; amount of wager</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rate of tax.</E> The tax is imposed at the rate of 10 percent of the amount of any taxable wager.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Amount of wager.</E> (i) The amount of the wager is the amount risked by the bettor, including any charge or fee incident to the placing of the wager as provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, rather than the amount <PRTPAGE P="39"/>which he stands to win. Thus, if a bettor bets $5 against a bookmaker's $7 with respect to the outcome of a prize fight, the amount of the wager subject to tax is $5.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a “parlay” wager (i.e., a single wager made by a bettor on the outcome of a series of events, usually horse races), the amount of the taxable wager is the amount initially wagered by the bettor irrespective of whether the parlay is successful. In the case of an “if” wager, the amount of the taxable wager is the total of all amounts wagered on each selection of the bettor. For example, A makes a $10 wager on horse R with the understanding that if horse R wins, $5 is to be wagered on horse S and $5 on horse T. If horse R wins, the taxable wager is $20. If horse R loses, the taxable wager is $10. In determining the amount of a taxable wager involving the features of, or a combination of, “parlay” and “if” bets, such as wagers sometimes referred to as a “whipsaw” or an “if and reverse” bet, the rules set forth above relating to “parlay” and “if” bets are to be followed. For example, assume B wagers $10 on horse R with the understanding that if horse R wins, $5 is to be placed as a parlay wager on horses S and T. In such a case, if horse R loses, the taxable wager is $10; if horse R wins, there are two taxable wagers amounting in the aggregate to $15.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of punchboards with prizes of merchandise, cash, or free plays listed thereon, the amount of the taxable wager is the amount risked by the bettor for all chances taken by him, including the chances taken by the bettor in lieu of the acceptance of an equivalent amount in cash or merchandise.</P>
              <P>(iv) In determining the amount of any wager subject to tax there shall be included any charge or fee incident to the placing of the wager. For example, in the case of a wager with respect to a horse race, any amount paid to a bookmaker for the purpose of guaranteeing the bettor a pay-off based on actual track odds is to be included as a part of the wager. Similarly, in the case of a lottery, any amount paid to the operator thereof by the bettor for the privilege of making a contribution to the pool or bank is also to be included in the amount of the wager. However, the amount of the wager subject to tax shall not include the amount of the tax where it is established by actual records of the taxpayer that such amount of tax was collected from the bettor as a separate charge.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 44.4401-2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Person liable for tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) Every person engaged in the business of accepting wagers with respect to a sports event or a contest is liable for the tax on any such wager accepted by him. Every person who operates a wagering pool or lottery conducted for profit is liable for the tax with respect to any wager or contribution placed in such pool or lottery. To be liable for the tax, it is not necessary that the person engaged in the business of accepting wagers or operating a wagering pool or lottery physically receive the wager or contribution. Any wager or contribution received by an agent or employee on behalf of such person shall be considered to have been accepted by and placed with such person.</P>

              <P>(2) Any person required to register under section 4412 by reason of having received wagers for or on behalf of another person, but who fails to register the name and place of residence of such other person (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as principal), shall be liable for the tax on all wagers received by him during the period in which he has failed to so register the name and place of residence of such principal. Subsequent compliance with section 4412 by the person receiving wagers for another does not relieve him of his liability and duty to pay such tax, nor will the fact that such person incurs liability with respect to the tax on such wagers, relieve his principal of liability for the tax imposed under section 4401 with respect to such wagers. Accordingly, both the person receiving the wagers and his principal shall be liable for the tax on such wagers until the tax is paid. Payment of the tax on such wagers shall not relieve the person receiving wagers of any penalty for failure to register as required by section 4412. This subparagraph has application only to wagers received after September 2, 1958.<PRTPAGE P="40"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">In business of accepting wagers.</E> A person is engaged in the business of accepting wagers if he makes it a practice to accept wagers with respect to which he assumes the risk of profit or loss depending upon the outcome of the event or the contest with respect to which the wager is accepted. It is not intended that to be engaged in the business of accepting wagers a person must be either so engaged to the exclusion of all other activities or even primarily so engaged. Thus, for example, an individual may be primarily engaged in business as a salesman, and also for the purpose of the tax be engaged in the business of accepting wagers.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Lay-offs.</E> If a person engaged in the business of accepting wagers or conducting a lottery or betting pool for profits lays off all or part of the wagers placed with him with another person engaged in the business of accepting wagers or conducting a betting pool or lottery for profit, he shall, notwithstanding such lay-off, be liable for the tax on the wagers or contributions initially accepted by him. See § 44.6419-2 for credit and refund provisions applicable with respect to laid-off wagers.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 44.4401-3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>When tax attaches.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The tax attaches when (a) a person engaged in the business of accepting wagers with respect to a sports event or a contest, or (b) a person who operates a wagering pool or lottery for profit, accepts a wager or contribution from a bettor. In the case of a wager on credit, the tax attaches whether or not the amount of the wager is actually collected from the bettor. However, if an amount equivalent to the amount of the wager is paid to the bettor prior to the close of the calendar month in which such wager was accepted, either because of the cancellation of the event upon which the wager was placed, or because the wager was cancelled or rescinded by mutual agreement, the wager need not be reported on the taxpayer's return for such month. Where such cancellation or rescission takes place in a month subsequent to the month in which the wager was accepted, credit or refund of the tax paid with respect to such wager may be made subject to the provisions of § 44.6419-1.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Parimutuel wagering enterprises.</E> Section 4402 provides that no tax shall be imposed by section 4401 on any wager placed with, or on any wager placed in a wagering pool conducted by, a parimutuel wagering enterprise licensed under State law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Wagering machines</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4402 provides that no tax shall be imposed by section 4401 on any wager placed in a coin-operated device (as defined in section 4462 as in effect for years beginning before July 1, 1980), or on any amount paid, in lieu of inserting a coin, token, or similar object, to operate a device described in section 4462(a)(2) (as so in effect). These devices include:</P>
              <P>(i) So-called “slot” machines that operate by means of the insertion of a coin, token, or similar object and that, by application of the element of chance, may deliver, or entitle the person playing or operating the machine to receive cash, premiums, merchandise, or tokens; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Machines that are similar to machines described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and are operated without the insertion of a coin, token, or similar object.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following devices and machines are examples of the devices referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) A machine that is operated by means of the insertion of a coin, token, or similar object and that, even though it does not dispense cash or tokens, has the features and characteristics of a gaming device whether or not evidence exists as to actual payoffs.</P>
              <P>(ii) A so-called crane machine, claw, digger, or rotary merchandising type device that is operated by the insertion of a coin and adjustment of a control lever for the purpose or removing from the machine, by gripping, pushing, or other manipulation articles such as figurines, lighters, etc., in the machine.</P>

              <P>(iii) A pinball machine equipped with a pushbutton for releasing free plays and a meter for recording the plays so released, or equipped with provisions <PRTPAGE P="41"/>for multiple coin insertion for increasing the odds.</P>
              <P>(iv) Pinball machines in connection with which free plays are redeemed in cash, tokens, or merchandise, or prizes are offered to any person for the attainment of designated scores.</P>
              <P>(v) A coin-operated machine that displays a poker hand or delivers a ticket with a poker hand symbolized on it that entitles the player to a prize if the poker hand displayed by the machine or symbolized on the ticket constitutes a winning hand.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax imposed by section 4401 applies to wagers (1) accepted in the United States, or (2) placed by a person who is in the United States (i) with a person who is a citizen or resident of the United States, or (ii) in a wagering pool or lottery conducted by a person who is a citizen or resident of the United States. All wagers made within the United States are taxable irrespective of the citizenship or place of residence of the parties to the wager. Thus, the tax applies to wagers placed within the United States, even though the person for whom or on whose behalf the wagers are received is located in a foreign country and is not a citizen or resident of the United States. Likewise, a wager accepted outside the United States by a citizen or resident of the United States is taxable if the person making such wager is within the United States at the time the wager is made.</P>

                <P>A syndicate which maintains its headquarters in a foreign country has representatives in the United States who receive wagers in the United States for or on behalf of such syndicate. For the purposes of section 4404, such wagers are considered as accepted within the United States, the syndicate is considered to be in the business of accepting wagers within the United States, and such wagers are subject to the tax. This is true regardless of the nationality or residence of the members of the syndicate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Wager.</E> The term “wager” means:</P>
                <P>(1) Any wager placed with a person engaged in the business of accepting wagers upon the outcome of a sports event or a contest;</P>

                <P>(2) Any wager placed in a wagering pool with respect to a sports event or a <PRTPAGE P="43"/>contest, if such pool is conducted for profit; and</P>
                <P>(3) Any wager placed in a lottery conducted for profit.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Lottery</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “lottery” includes the numbers game, policy, and similar types of wagering. In general, a lottery conducted for profit includes any scheme or method for the distribution of prizes among persons who have paid or promised a consideration for a chance to win such prizes, usually as determined by the numbers or symbols on tickets as drawn from a lottery wheel or other receptacle, or by the outcome of an event: <E T="03">Provided,</E> Such lottery is conducted for profit. The term also includes enterprises commonly known as “policy” or “numbers” and similar types of wagering where the player selects a number, or a combination of numbers, and pays or agrees to pay a certain amount in consideration of which the operator of the lottery, policy, or numbers game agrees to pay a prize or fixed sum of money if the selected number or combination of numbers appear or are published in a manner understood by the parties. For example, the winning number or combination of numbers may appear or be published as a series of numbers in the payoff prices of a series of horse races at a certain race track, or in the United States Treasury balance reports, or the reports of a stock or commodity exchange. This description is not intended to be restrictive; hence, the substitution of letters or other symbols for numbers or a different arrangement for determining the winning number or combination of numbers, does not alter the fundamental nature of a game which otherwise would be considered a lottery. The operation of a punch board or a similar gaming device for profit is also considered to be the operation of a lottery.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Certain games excluded</E>—(i) <E T="03">Cards, dice, etc.</E> Section 4421 specifically excludes from the term “lottery” any game of a type in which usually (<E T="03">a</E>) the wagers are placed, (<E T="03">b</E>) the winners are determined, and (<E T="03">c</E>) the distribution of prizes or other property is made, in the presence of all persons placing wagers in such game. Thus, for example, no tax would be payable with respect to wagers made in a bingo or keno game since such a game is usually conducted under circumstances in which the wagers are placed, the winners are determined, and the distribution of prizes is made in the presence of all persons participating in the game. For the same reason, no tax would apply in the case of card games, dice games, or games involving wheels of chance, such as roulette wheels and gambling wheels of a type used at carnivals and public fairs.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Drawings conducted by an organization exempt from tax under section 501 or 521.</E> Section 4421 specifically excludes from the term “lottery” any drawing conducted by an organization exempt from tax under section 501 or 521 if no part of the net proceeds derived from such drawing inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. For provisions relating to exemption from income tax under section 501 or 521, see the Income Tax Regulations (Part 1 of this chapter).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Other terms used</E>—(1) <E T="03">Wagering pool.</E> A wagering pool conducted for profit includes any scheme or method for the distribution of prizes to one or more winning bettors based upon the outcome of a sports event or a contest, or a combination or series of such events or contests, provided such wagering pool is managed and conducted for the purpose of making a profit.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Sports event.</E> A sports event includes every type of sports event, whether amateur, scholastic, or professional, such as horse racing, auto racing, dog racing, boxing and wrestling matches and exhibitions, baseball, football, and basketball games, tennis and golf matches, track meets, etc.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Contest.</E> A contest includes any type of contest involving speed, skill, endurance, popularity, politics, strength, appearances, etc., such as a general or primary election, the outcome of a nominating convention, a dance marathon, a log-rolling, wood-chopping, weight-lifting, corn-husking, beauty contest, etc.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Conducted for profit.</E> A wagering pool or lottery may be conducted for profit even though a direct profit will not inure from the operation thereof. A wagering pool or lottery operated with the expectancy of a profit in the form <PRTPAGE P="44"/>of increased sales, increased attendance, or other indirect benefits is conducted for profit for purposes of the wagering tax.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payment of special tax.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Condition precedent to carrying on business.</E> No persons shall engage in the business of accepting wagers subject to the tax imposed by section 4401 until he has filed a return on Form 11-C and paid the special tax imposed by section 4411. Likewise, no person shall engage in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person engaged in the business of accepting wagers until he has filed a return on Form 11-C and paid the special tax imposed by section 4411. For provisions relating to the tax imposed by section 4401 and the special tax imposed by section 4411, see Subparts B and C of this part, respectively.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of special tax.</E> (1) Section 4411 imposes a special tax of $50 per year which is required to be paid by each person who is liable for the tax imposed by section 4401 (tax on wagers) or who is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person who is liable for the tax imposed by section 4401. A person engaged both in accepting wagers on his own account and in receiving wagers for or on behalf of some other person is required to purchase but one special tax stamp.</P>
                <P>(2) The tax year begins July 1 and ends June 30 of the following calendar year. Persons commencing business between August 1 and June 30 (both dates inclusive) shall pay a proportionate part of the annual tax. “Commencing business” means the initial acceptance by a person of a wager subject to the tax imposed by section 4401 or the initial receiving of a taxable wager by an agent or employee for or on behalf of some other person. Persons in business for only a portion of a month are liable for tax for the full month, i.e., a person first becoming subject to the special tax on, for example, the 20th day of a month, is liable for tax for the entire month.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Tax payment evidenced by special tax stamp.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a return on Form 11-C, together with remittance of the full amount of tax due, the district director will issue a special tax stamp as evidence of payment of the special tax.</P>
                <P>(2) District directors will distinctly write or print on the stamp before it is delivered or mailed to the taxpayer the following information: (i) The taxpayer's registered name, and (ii) the business or office address of the taxpayer if he has one; if not, the residence address. Special tax stamps will be transmitted by ordinary mail, unless it is requested that they be transmitted by registered mail in which case additional cost to cover registry fee shall be remitted with the return.</P>
                <P>(3) District directors and their collection officers are forbidden to issue receipts in lieu of stamps representing the payment of special taxes.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Changes through death.</E> Whenever any person who has paid the special tax imposed by section 4411 dies, the surviving spouse or child, or executor or <PRTPAGE P="45"/>administrator, or other legal representative, may carry on such business for the remainder of the term for which such special tax has been paid without any additional payment, subject to the conditions hereinafter stated. If the surviving spouse or child, or executor or administrator, or other legal representative of the deceased taxpayer continues the business, such person shall within 30 days after the date of the death of the taxpayer execute a return on Form 11-C. Such return shall show the name of the deceased taxpayer, together with all other data required to be reported on Form 11-C (see § 44.4412-1), and the stamp issued to such taxpayer shall be submitted with the return for proper notation by the district director.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Changes from other causes.</E> A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy may continue the business under the stamp issued to the taxpayer at the place and for the period for which the special tax was paid. An assignee for the benefit of creditors may continue business under his assignor's special tax stamp without incurring additional special tax liability. In such cases the change shall be registered with the district director in a manner similar to that required by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Changes in firm.</E> When one or more members of a firm partnership withdraw, the business may be continued by the remaining partner or partners under the same special tax stamp for the remainder of the period for which the stamp was issued to the old firm. The change shall, however, be registered in the same manner as required in paragraph (a) of this section. If new partners are taken into a firm the new firm so constituted may not carry on business under the special tax stamp of the old firm. The new firm shall make a return on Form 11-C and pay the special tax imposed by section 4411 reckoned from the first day of the month in which it began business, even though the name of such firm be the same as that of the old. If the members of a partnership, which has paid the special tax, form a corporation to continue the business a new special tax stamp must be obtained in the name of the corporation.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Change in corporation.</E> If a corporation changes its name, no additional tax is due, provided the change in name is registered with the district director in the manner required by paragraph (a) of this section. An increase in the capital stock of a corporation does not create a new special tax liability if the laws of the State under which it is incorporated permit such increase without the formation of a new corporation. A stockholder in a corporation, who after its dissolution continues the business, incurs liability for the special tax imposed by section 4411 unless he already has a special tax stamp obtained in respect of activities conducted as a sole proprietor.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure by taxpayer</E>—(1) <E T="03">After June 30, 1963.</E> Whenever, after June 30, 1963, a taxpayer changes his business or residence address to a location other than that specified in his last return on Form 11-C, he shall register the change with the district director from whom the special tax stamp was purchased by filing a new return, Form 11-C, designated “Supplemental Return”, setting forth the new address and the date of change. He shall so register the change of address before:</P>
                <P>(i) He engages in any wagering activity at the new address, or</P>
                <P>(ii) The termination of a 30-day period which begins on the day after the date of such change,</P>
                <FP>whichever occurs first. The taxpayer's special tax stamp shall accompany the supplemental return for proper notation by the district director. As to liability in case of failure to register a change of address, see § 44.4905-3.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Before July 1, 1963.</E> Whenever, before July 1, 1963, a taxpayer changes his business or residence address to a location other than that specified in his last return of Form 11-C, he shall, within 30 days after the date of such change, register the change with the district director from whom the special tax stamp was purchased by filing a new return, Form 11-C, designated “Supplemental Return”, setting forth the new address and the date of change. The taxpayer's special tax stamp shall accompany the supplemental return for <PRTPAGE P="46"/>proper notation by the district director. As to liability in case of failure to register a change of address, see § 44.4905-3.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure by district director; removal within district.</E> When registration of a change of address within the same district is made by a taxpayer in the manner specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the district director, if necessary, will enter on his records the new address and the date of change. If the information disclosed on the supplemental return is such as to require a change on the face of the special tax stamp, the district director will make the proper change and return the stamp to the taxpayer.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure by district director; removal to another district.</E> In case of removal of the taxpayer's office or principal place of business (or residence address, if he has no office or principal place of business) to another district, the district director, after noting the transfer on his records, shall transmit the special tax stamp to the district director for the district to which such office or business was removed. The latter will make an entry on his records, as in the case of an original registration in his district, correct the address on the stamp, if necessary, and note also thereon his name, title, date, and district, and then forward the stamp to the taxpayer.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Specified health insurance policy</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and § 46.4377-1, <E T="03">specified health insurance policy</E> means any accident and health insurance policy (including a policy under a group health plan) issued with respect to individuals residing in the United States (as defined in § 46.4377-1(a)(2)), including prepaid health coverage arrangements described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. <E T="03">Specified health insurance policy</E> also includes any policy that provides accident and health coverage to an active employee, former employee, or qualifying beneficiary, as continuation coverage required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) or similar continuation coverage under other Federal law or state law.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The term <E T="03">specified health insurance policy</E> does not include—</P>
              <P>(A) Any insurance policy if substantially all of its coverage is of excepted benefits described in section 9832(c);</P>
              <P>(B) Any group policy issued to an employer where the facts and circumstances show that the group policy was designed and issued specifically to cover primarily employees who are working and residing outside of the United States (as defined in § 46.4377-1(a)(3));</P>
              <P>(C) Any stop loss or indemnity reinsurance policy; or</P>
              <P>(D) Any insurance policy to the extent it provides an employee assistance program, disease management program, or wellness program if the program does not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Stop loss policy.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, <E T="03">stop loss policy</E> means an insurance policy in which—</P>
              <P>(A) The insurer that issues the policy to a person establishing or maintaining a self-insured health plan becomes liable for all, or an agreed upon portion of, losses that person incurs in covering the applicable lives in excess of a specified amount; and</P>
              <P>(B) The person establishing or maintaining the self-insured health plan retains its liability to, and its contractual relationship with, the applicable lives covered.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Indemnity reinsurance policy.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, <E T="03">indemnity reinsurance policy</E> means an agreement between two or more insurance companies under which—</P>
              <P>(A) The reinsuring company agrees to accept and to indemnify the issuing company for all or part of the risk of loss under policies specified in the agreement; and</P>
              <P>(B) The issuing company retains its liability to, and its contractual relationship with, the applicable lives covered.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prepaid health coverage arrangement.</E> The term <E T="03">prepaid health coverage arrangement</E> means an arrangement under which fixed payments or premiums are received as consideration for a person's agreement to provide or arrange for the provision of accident and health coverage to individuals residing in the United States, regardless of how such coverage is provided or arranged to be provided. For example, any hospital or medical service policy or certificate, hospital or medical service plan contract, or health maintenance organization contract is a specified health insurance policy.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculation of fee</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The amount of the fee for a policy for a policy year is equal to the product of the average number of lives covered under the policy for the policy year (determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section) and the applicable dollar amount (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section). For purposes of computing the fee under this paragraph <PRTPAGE P="55"/>(c), in the case of an issuer that determines the average number of lives covered for all policies in effect during a calendar year using the member months method under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section or the state form method under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, the applicable dollar amount with respect to such issuer's policies for such calendar year is the applicable dollar amount for policy years ending on December 31 of such calendar year (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section), except that the applicable dollar amount with respect to such an issuer's policies for calendar year 2019 is the applicable dollar amount for policy years ending on September 30, 2019. For more information, see the examples in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B), (c)(2)(iv)(B), (c)(2)(v)(B), and (c)(2)(vi)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of the average number of lives covered under a policy</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> To determine the average number of lives covered under a specified health insurance policy during a policy year, an issuer must use one of the following methods—</P>
              <P>(A) The actual count method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section);</P>
              <P>(B) The snapshot method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section);</P>
              <P>(C) The member months method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section); or</P>
              <P>(D) The state form method (described in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Consistency requirements.</E> An issuer must use the same method of calculating the average number of lives covered under a policy consistently for the duration of the year. In addition, for all policies for which a liability is reported on a Form 720, “Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,” for a particular year, the issuer must use the same method of computing lives covered. An issuer that determines the average number of lives covered by using the actual count method described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section or the snapshot method described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section may change its method of computing the average lives covered to the snapshot method or actual count method, respectively, provided that the issuer uses the same method for computing the average lives covered for all policies for which a liability is reported on the Form 720 for that year. For example, an issuer with a policy having a policy year that ends on June 30, Policy A, may determine the average number of lives covered under Policy A for July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014, using the actual count method if the issuer uses the actual count method for all policies for which a liability will be reported on the Form 720 due by July 31, 2015 (the due date for return that will include the liability for the July 2013 to June 2014 policy year for Policy A). The issuer may change its method for determining the average number of lives covered under Policy A to the snapshot method for the July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, policy year, provided that the snapshot method is used for all policies for which a liability will be reported on the Form 720 due by July 31, 2016 (the due date for return that will include the liability for the July 2014 to June 2015 policy year for Policy A). An issuer that determines the average number of lives covered by using the member months method under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section or the state form method under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section must use the same method for calculating lives covered for all policy years for which the fee applies.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Actual count method</E>—(A) <E T="03">Calculation method.</E> An issuer may determine the average number of lives covered under a policy for a policy year by adding the total number of lives covered for each day of the policy year and dividing that total by the number of days in the policy year.</P>

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>

                <P>Insurance Company A issues three policies that are in effect during 2014, Group Health Insurance Policy A, which has a policy year from December 1 to November 30, Group Health Insurance Policy B, which has a policy year from March 1 to February 28, and Group Health Insurance Policy C, which has a policy year from January 1 to December 31. To calculate the average number of lives covered for 2014, Insurance Company A must calculate the average number of lives covered for each of its three policies <PRTPAGE P="56"/>for the policy year that ends in 2014. Insurance Company A chooses to use the actual count method under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section to determine average lives covered for policies having a policy year that ends in 2014. Insurance Company A calculates the sum of lives covered under Policy A for each day of the policy year ending November 30, 2014, as 3,285,000. The average number of lives covered under Policy A for the policy year ending November 30, 2014, is 3,285,000 divided by 365, or 9,000. Insurance Company A calculates the sum of lives covered under Policy B for each day of the policy year ending February 28, 2014, as 547,500. The average number of lives covered under Policy B for the policy year ending on February 28, 2014, is 547,500 divided by 365, or 1,500. Insurance Company A calculates the sum of lives covered under Policy C for each day of the policy year ending December 31, 2014, as 4,380,000. The average number of lives covered under Policy C for the policy year ending December 31, 2014, is 4,380,000 divided by 365, or 12,000. To calculate the section 4375 fee under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for calendar year 2014, Insurance Company A must first determine the applicable dollar amount for each policy under paragraph (c)(4) of this section and multiply that amount by the average number of lives covered for that policy. Insurance Company A then adds the total fees for all three policies to determine the total fee under section 4375 that it must pay for calendar year 2014.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Snapshot method</E>—(A) <E T="03">Calculation method.</E> An issuer may determine the average number of lives covered under a policy for a policy year by adding the totals of lives covered on a date during the first, second, or third month of each quarter (or more dates in each quarter if an equal number of dates is used for each quarter), and dividing that total by the number of dates on which a count is made. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A), each date used for the second, third and fourth quarters must be within three days of the date in that quarter that corresponds to the date used for the first quarter, and all dates used must be within the same policy year. If an issuer uses multiple dates for the first quarter, the issuer must use dates in the second, third, and fourth quarters that correspond to each of the dates used for the first quarter or are within three days of such corresponding dates, and all dates used must be within the same policy year. The 30th and 31st day of a month are treated as the last day of the month for purposes of determining the corresponding date for any month that has fewer than 31 days (for example, if either March 30 or March 31 is used as a counting date for a calendar year policy, June 30 is the corresponding date for the second quarter).</P>

                <P>(i) Insurance Company B issues three policies with 12-month policy years that end in 2014, Group Health Insurance Policy A, which has a policy year from December 1 to November 30, Group Health Insurance Policy B, which has a policy year from March 1 to February 28, and Group Health Insurance Policy C, which has a policy year from January 1 to December 31. To calculate the average number of lives covered for 2014, Insurance Company B must calculate the average number of lives covered for each of its three policies for the policy year that ends in 2014. Insurance Company B chooses to determine the average lives covered using the snapshot method for all policies that have a policy year that ends in 2014 and chooses to count lives covered on a single date of the first month of each quarter of the policy years. Thus, for Policy A, Insurance Company B must count lives covered on a single date falling in each of December 2013, March 2014, June 2014 and September 2014; for Policy B, Insurance Company B must count lives covered on a single date falling in each of March 2014, June 2014, September 2014 and December 2014; and for Policy C, Insurance Company B must count lives covered on a single date falling in each of January 2014, April 2014, July 2014 and October 2014. In addition, the date for each of the second, third, and fourth quarters must fall within three days of the date in such quarter that corresponds to the date used for the first quarter, and must fall within the same policy year.</P>
                <P>(ii) On December 6, 2013, Policy A covers 8,900 lives, on March 7, 2014, 9,100 lives, on June 6, 2014, 9,050 lives, and on September 5, 2014, 9,050 lives. Insurance Company B treats the average number of lives covered under Policy A for the policy year ending November 30, 2014, as 36,100 (8,900 + 9,100 + 9,050 + 9,050) divided by 4, or 9,025.</P>
                <P>(iii) On March 4, 2013, Policy B covers 1,500 lives, on June 7, 2013, 1,350 lives, on September 6, 2013, 1,400 lives, and on December 6, 2013, 1,550 lives. Insurance Company B treats the average number of lives covered under Policy B for the policy year ending February 28, 2014, as 5,800 (1,500 + 1,350 + 1,400 + 1,550) divided by 4, or 1,450.</P>

                <P>(iv) On January 6, 2014, Policy C covers 12,500 lives, on April 4, 2014, 12,250 lives, on July 7, 2014, 12,000 lives, and on October 3, <PRTPAGE P="57"/>2014, 11,250 lives. Insurance Company B treats the average number of lives covered under Policy C for the policy year ending December 31, 2014, as 47,750 (12,500 + 12,250 + 12,000 + 11,250) divided by 4, or 12,000.</P>
                <P>(v) To calculate the section 4375 fee under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for calendar year 2014, Insurance Company B must first determine the applicable dollar amount for each policy under paragraph (c)(4) of this section and multiply that amount by the number of average lives covered for that policy. Insurance Company B then adds the total fees for all three policies to determine the total fee under section 4375 that it must pay for calendar year 2014.</P>

                <P>Insurance Company C chooses to determine the average number of lives covered for all years to which the section 4375 fee applies using the member months method of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section. Insurance Company C reports 12,000,000 as its member months on the NAIC Supplemental Health Care Exhibit filed for calendar year 2013. Under the member months method, Insurance Company C calculates the average number of lives covered for all its specified health insurance policies in force during calendar year 2013 by dividing 12,000,000 (member months) by 12 (number of months in the reporting period), which equals 1,000,000. To determine the section 4375 fee it must pay for calendar year 2013, Insurance Company C multiplies 1,000,000 by the applicable dollar amount that is in effect at the end of the calendar year under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>

Under the state form method, Insurance Company D calculates the average number of lives covered for all of its specified health insurance policies in force during calendar year 2013 by dividing 12,000,000 (equivalent member months) by 12 (number of months in the reporting period), which equals 1,000,000. To determine the section 4375 fee it must pay for calendar year 2013, Insurance Company D multiplies 1,000,000 by the applicable dollar amount that is in effect at the end of the calendar year under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) A plan that provides benefits substantially all of which are excepted benefits, as defined in section 9832(c). For example, a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA) (as described in section 106(c)(2)) that satisfies the requirements to be treated as an excepted benefit under section 9832(c) and § 54.9831-1(c)(3)(v) of this chapter is not an applicable self-insured health plan. A health FSA that is not treated as an excepted benefit under section 9832(c) and § 54.9831-1(c)(3)(v) is an applicable self-insured health plan.</P>
              <P>(B) An employee assistance program, disease management program, or wellness program if the program does not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment.</P>
              <P>(C) A plan that, as demonstrated by the facts and circumstances surrounding the adoption and operation of the plan, was designed specifically to cover primarily employees who are working and residing outside the United States (as defined in § 46.4377-1(a)(3)).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Multiple self-insured arrangements established or maintained by the same plan sponsor.</E> For purposes of section 4376, two or more arrangements established or maintained by the same plan sponsor that provide for accident and health coverage (within the meaning of § 46.4377-1(a)) other than through an insurance policy and that have the same plan year may be treated as a single applicable self-insured health plan for purposes of calculating the fee imposed by section 4376. For example, if a plan sponsor establishes or maintains a self-insured arrangement providing major medical benefits, and a separate self-insured arrangement with the same plan year providing prescription drug benefits, the two arrangements may be treated as one applicable self-insured health plan so that the same life covered under each arrangement would count as only one covered life under the plan for purposes of calculating the fee. Similarly, if a plan sponsor provides a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) and another applicable self-insured health plan that provides major medical coverage, the HRA and the major medical plan may be treated as one applicable self-insured health plan if the HRA and the self-insured plan have the same plan year.</P>

                <P>(iii) Because Plan 501 and Plan 502 provide accident and health coverage (within the meaning of § 46.4377-1(a)) and are maintained by Plan Sponsor D for the benefit of its employees, Plans 501 and 502 are applicable self-insured health plans that are subject to the fee imposed by section 4376. Because dental and vision benefits are excepted benefits, as defined in section 9832(c), Plan 503 is not an applicable self-insured health plan subject to the section 4376 fee. Under the special rule set forth in § 46.4376-2(b)(1)(iii), Plan Sponsor D may treat Plans 501 and 502 (both self-insured plans with a calendar year plan year) as a single plan for purposes of calculating the fee imposed by section 4376.</P>

Therefore, in accordance with the exception described in § 46.4376-1(b)(1)(ii)(C), Plan 503 is not an applicable self-insured health plan.</P>

                <P>(i) Corporation XYZ is a holding company with no employees that owns all the issued and outstanding shares of Employer X, Employer Y, and Employer Z. Employer X, Employer Y, and Employer Z have established the XYZ Group Health Plan to provide accident and health coverage, provided other than through an insurance policy, for the benefit of their employees. The XYZ Group Health Plan has a calendar year plan year. In addition, there is no plan sponsor identified or designated in the plan document.</P>
                <P>(ii) Because the XYZ Group Health Plan provides accident and health coverage other than through an insurance policy, and is established by one or more employers for the benefit of their employees, the XYZ Group Health Plan is an applicable self-insured health plan under section 4376(c)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

Accordingly, Employer X, Employer Y, and Employer Z each must file a Form 720 reflecting their separate liabilities under section 4376, calculated based on lives covered that are employees of that employer (or spouses, dependents, or other beneficiaries of employees of that employer) and the applicable dollar amount in effect for the plan year.</P>

              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Snapshot method</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> A plan sponsor may determine the average number of lives covered under an applicable self-insured health plan for a plan year by adding the totals of lives covered on a date during the first, second, or third month of each quarter <PRTPAGE P="62"/>of the plan year (or more dates in each quarter if an equal number of dates is used in each quarter), and dividing that total by the number of dates on which a count was made. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), each date used for the second, third and fourth quarter must be within three days of the date in that quarter that corresponds to the date used for the first quarter, and all dates used must fall within the same plan year. If a plan sponsor uses multiple dates for the first quarter, the plan sponsor must use dates in the second, third, and fourth quarters that correspond to each of the dates used for the first quarter or are within three days of such corresponding dates, and all dates used must fall within the same plan year. The 30th and 31st day of a month are treated as the last day of the month for purposes of determining the corresponding date for any month that has fewer than 31 days (for example, if either March 30 or March 31 is used for a calendar year plan, June 30 is the corresponding date for the second quarter). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the number of lives covered on a designated date may be determined using either the snapshot factor method described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or the snapshot count method described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Registration-required obligation.</E> The term “registration-required obligation” has the same meaning as when used in section 163(f) (and the regulations thereunder) which relates to the denial of a deduction for interest on certain obligations not in registered form.

              <P>(6) <E T="03">Date of Issuance.</E> (i) For obligations intended to be offered to the public, the term “date of issuance” means the date the obligation is first sold to the public at the issue price.</P>
              <P>(ii) For an obligation which is privately placed, the term “date of issuance” is the date the obligation is first sold by the issuer.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Issue price.</E> See section 1273 (b) and the regulations thereunder for the definition of “issue price”.</P>

              <FP>For purposes of this paragraph, the term “principal amount” for a discounted obligation is the issue price, and for all other obligations, including obligations sold at a premium, the term “principal amount” is the stated redemption price at maturity.</FP>

              <P>The regulations in this part 48 are designated “Manufacturers and Retailers Excise Tax Regulations.” The regulations relate to the excise taxes imposed by chapter 31 and 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. Chapter 31 (relating to retail taxes) imposes tax on certain luxury items, special fuels, fuel used in commercial transportation on inland waterways, and heavy trucks and trailers. Chapter 32 (relating to manufacturers taxes) imposes tax on gas guzzler automobiles, highway-type tires, taxable fuel, aviation fuel, coal, certain vaccines, sporting goods, and taxable medical devices. Although chapter 32 also imposes a tax on firearms, this tax is under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. See part 40 of this chapter for regulations relating to returns, payments, and deposits of taxes imposed by chapters 31 and 32 (other than the tax on firearms imposed by section 4181).</P>

              <SUBJECT>General definitions and attachment of tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Meaning of terms.</E> As used in the regulations in this part, unless otherwise expressly indicated:</P>
              <P>(1) The terms defined in the provisions of law contained in the regulations in this part shall have the meanings so assigned to them.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3) The term <E T="03">calendar quarter</E> means a period of 3 calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The term <E T="03">manufacturer</E> includes any person who produces a taxable article from scrap, salvage, or junk material, or from new or raw material, by processing, manipulating, or changing the form of an article or by combining or assembling two or more articles. The term also includes a “producer” and an “importer”. An “importer” of a taxable article is any person who brings such an article into the United States from a source outside the United States, or who withdraws such an article from a customs bonded warehouse for sale or use in the United States. If the nominal importer of a taxable article is not its beneficial owner (for example, the nominal importer is a customs broker engaged by the beneficial owner), the beneficial owner is the “importer” of the article for purposes of chapter 32 and is liable for tax on his sale or use of the article in the United States. See section 4219 and the regulations thereunder for the circumstances under which sales by persons other than the manufacturer or importer are subject to the manufacturers excise tax.</P>
              <P>(ii) Under certain circumstances, as where a person manufactures or produces a taxable article for another person who furnishes materials under an agreement whereby the person who furnished the materials retains title thereto and to the finished article, the person for whom the taxable article is manufactured or produced, and not the person who actually manufactures or produces it, will be considered the manufacturer.</P>

              <P>(iii) A manufacturer who sells a taxable article in a knockdown condition is liable for the tax as a manufacturer. Whether the person who buys such <PRTPAGE P="71"/>component parts and assembles a taxable article from them will also be liable for tax as a further manufacturer of a taxable article will depend on the relative amount of labor, material, and overhead required to assemble the completed article and on whether the article is assembled for a business or personal use. See section 4218 and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(5) The term <E T="03">sale</E> means an agreement whereby the seller transfers the property (that is, the title or the substantial incidents of ownership) in goods to the buyer for a consideration called the price, which may consist of money, services, or other things.</P>
              <P>(6) The term <E T="03">taxable article</E> means any article taxable under section 4041 or Chapter 32, Subtitle D, of the Code.</P>
              <P>(7) The term <E T="03">vendor</E> includes a lessor except that, with respect to the manufacturers excise taxes, this rule applies only where the lessor is also the manufacturer of the article.</P>
              <P>(8) The term <E T="03">purchaser</E> includes a lessee except that, with respect to the manufacturers excise taxes, this rule applies only where the lessor is also the manufacturer of the article.</P>
              <P>(9) The term <E T="03">exporter</E> means the person named as shipper or consignor in the export bill of lading.</P>
              <P>(10) The term <E T="03">exportation</E> means the severance of an article from the mass of things belonging within the United States with the intention of uniting it with the mass of things belonging within some foreign country or within a possession of the United States.</P>
              <P>(11) The term <E T="03">possession of the United States</E> includes Guam, the Midway Islands, Palmyra, the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Attachment of tax.</E> (1) For purposes of this part, the manufacturers excise tax generally attaches when the title to the article sold passes from the manufacturer to a purchaser, and the retailers excise tax generally attaches when the title to the article sold passes from the retailer to a purchaser.</P>
              <P>(2) When title passes is dependent upon the intention of the parties as gathered from the contract of sale and the attendant circumstances. In the absence of expressed intention, the legal rules of presumption followed in the jurisdiction where the sale is made govern in determining when title passes.</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of a sale on credit, the tax attaches whether or not the purchase price is actually collected.</P>
              <P>(4) Where a consignor (such as a manufacturer) consigns articles to a consignee (such as a dealer), retaining ownership in them until they are disposed of by the consignee, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach, until sale by the consignee. Where the relationship between a manufacturer and a dealer is that of principal and agent, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach, until sale by the dealer.</P>
              <P>(5) In the case of a lease, an installment sale, a conditional sale, or a chattel mortgage arrangement or similar arrangement creating a security interest, a proportionate part of the tax attaches to each payment. See section 4217 and the regulations thereunder for a limitation on the amount of tax payable on lease payments.</P>
              <P>(6) In the case of use by the manufacturer, the tax attaches at the time the use begins.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemption certificates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Several sections of the regulations in this part, relating to sales exempt from retailers or manufacturers excise tax, require the retailer or manufacturer (as the case may be) to obtain an exemption certificate from the purchaser to substantiate the exempt character of the sale. Many of these sections also contain specimen forms of acceptable exemption certificates. However, any form of exemption certificate will be acceptable if it includes all the information required to be contained in such a certificate by the pertinent sections of the regulations in this part. If it contains all the required information, a form of exemption certificate that is processed by data processing equipment is acceptable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application of tax on sales of special motor fuel for use in motor vehicles and motorboats.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax imposed by paragraph (2)(A) of section 4041 (a), (or before April 1, 1983, paragraph (1) of section 4041 (b)), applies to the taxable sale of special motor fuel by any person to an owner, lessee, or other operator of a motor vehicle or motorboat, for use as a fuel in the motor vehicle or motorboat. The tax does not apply to special motor fuel sold for use on or after April 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1988, in an off-highway business use.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Liability for tax.</E> The tax on the taxable sale of special motor fuel is payable by the person who sells the special motor fuel to the owner, lessee, or other operator of a motor vehicle or motorboat.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rate of tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Tax is imposed on the sale of special motor fuel at the rate applicable on the date on which the special motor fuel is sold. See § 48.4041-1(b)(2) for rates. The test of taxability at the rates specified in § 48.4041-1(b)(2) (i)(A) and (ii)(A) is whether the fuel is to be used in a motor vehicle or motorboat. For purposes of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section, the term “qualified business use” has the same meaning as that given to the term “off-highway business use” by section 6421(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special motor fuel sold for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle.</E> Tax at the rates specified in paragraphs (b)(2) (i)(A) and (ii)(A) of § 48.4041-1 applies in the case of the sale of special motor fuel for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle. Tax at the rates specified in that section applies regardless of whether the motor vehicle is a highway vehicle. However, a reduced rate of tax from that imposed by paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) of § 48.4041-1 is allowed by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of § 48.4041-1 if special motor fuel is sold for use in a qualified business use. An exemption from the tax imposed by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of § 48.4041-1 is allowed by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of § 48.4041-1 if the special motor fuel is sold for use in an off-highway business use.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Special motor fuel sold for use as fuel in a motorboat.</E> Tax at the rates specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (ii)(A) of § 48.4041-1 applies in the case of the sale of special motor fuel for use as fuel in a motorboat. The qualified business use reduced rate of tax set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of § 48.4041-1 and the off-highway business use exemption set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of § 48.4041-1 are not applicable to motorboats unless the motorboat is a vessel employed in the fisheries or whaling business. See section 6421(d)(2)(B).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Example.</E> Application of the tax to the sale of special motor fuels may be illustrated by the following example.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>

                <P>The N Company is engaged in the manufacture of ceramic products. It has a vehicle which is used to haul clay from a clay pit to its factory. This vehicle has not been registered for highway use and under the applicable State law is not required to be registered for highway use since none of the hauling of clay is done on public highways. The N Company also uses a ditch digging machine in the vicinity of the clay pit for the construction of drains. A fork lift truck is used to move cartons of merchandise from place to place inside the company's warehouse and to assist in the loading of merchandise onto the company's highway trucks for delivery to purchasers. The highway trucks are registered by the State for use on highways. Special motor fuel is used for the operation of all of these items of equipment. Before April 1, 1983, the special motor fuel sold for use as a fuel in the registered highway trucks is subject to tax at the rate specified in § 48.4041-1(b)(2)(i)(A). On or after January 1, 1979, and before April 1, 1983, the special motor fuel sold for use as a fuel in the unregistered truck used to haul clay from the pit to the factory and in the fork lift truck, assuming both of these are used in qualified business uses, is subject to tax at <PRTPAGE P="73"/>the rate specified in § 48.4041-1(b)(2)(i)(C). If the unregistered truck and forklift are not used in qualified business uses, then the special motor fuel sold for use in these vehicles is taxable at the rate specified in § 48.4041-1(b)(2)(i)(A) since both are motor vehicles. No tax is payable with respect to the special motor fuel sold for use in the ditch digging machine since that machine is not a motor vehicle. On and after April 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1988, special motor fuel sold for use in the registered trucks is taxable at the rate specified in § 48.4041-1(b)(2)(ii)(A) because the trucks are motor vehicles. On and after April 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1988, special motor fuel sold for use in the unregistered truck and the fork lift, assuming that both vehicles are used in off-highway business uses, is exempt from tax as specified in § 48.4041-1(b)(2)(ii)(C). If the unregistered truck and fork lift are not used in off-highway business uses, then the special motor fuel sold for use in these vehicles is taxable at the rate specified in § 48.4041-1(b)(2)(ii)(A) since both are motor vehicles. No tax is payable with respect to the special motor fuel sold for use in the ditch digging machine since that machine is not a motor vehicle.</P>

For purpose of this paragraph (a), liquid fuel sold at a location unattended by <PRTPAGE P="74"/>the seller (such as under a cardlock or meter system) on or after January 2, 1986, is considered to be delivered into the fuel supply tank by the seller except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. In this regard, see section 6427(a) for credit or refund of tax if liquid fuel acquired in a transaction subject to tax is used in a nontaxable use.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the seller maintains special devices at the unattended location to account accurately for sales of liquid fuel for nontaxable uses (such as assigning a separate “nontaxable” meter or, in a cardlock system, issuing a special “nontaxable” card to a customer who regularly purchases fuel for nontaxable uses), then such sales of liquid fuel shall be considered nontaxable. The seller must maintain sufficient records of such nontaxable sales and include in these records the name of the purchaser, the date of the purchase, and the quantity of fuel purchased in each sale.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Bulk tanks.</E> The sale of diesel fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of a diesel-powered highway vehicle, or of special motor fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of a motor vehicle or motorboat, or of fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of an aircraft used in noncommercial aviation is considered a taxable sale of the liquid fuel if—</P>
              <P>(i) The liquid fuel is delivered by the seller into a bulk supply tank (or other container) that is not the fuel supply tank of a vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The purchaser furnishes a written statement to the seller before or at the time of the sale stating that the entire quantity of the liquid fuel covered by the sale is for a taxable purpose as a fuel in such a vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft.</P>
              <FP>If the purchaser fails to provide the written statement required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the purchaser is liable for the tax on the later taxable sale or use. If a purchaser acquires both fuel that is to be used for taxable purposes and fuel that is to be used for nontaxable purposes, and the fuel that is to be used for taxable purposes is stored in a different storage tank (or container) from the tank used to store the fuel to be used for nontaxable purposes, the written statement described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section will relate to the fuel to be used for taxable purposes if proper records are kept by the purchaser that sufficiently identify the tanks (or containers) into which tax-paid fuel is delivered and the quantities of fuel delivered into those tanks (or containers). If only occasional sales for delivery into a bulk storage tank (or other container) are made to a purchaser, a separate statement must be furnished for each order. However, if sales are regularly or frequently made to a purchaser, a written statement covering all orders for a specified period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters is acceptable.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales for resale and to consignees.</E> (1) A sale to a dealer for resale is not subject to tax even if it is known at the time of the sale that the liquid fuel will be resold by the dealer for use as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle, motor vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft.</P>
              <P>(2) The tax is payable by the person who makes the taxable sale. If a taxable liquid fuel is consigned to a person for sale and the consignor retains ownership in the liquid fuel until it is disposed of by the consignee, the consignor is the person liable for the tax when a taxable sale of the liquid fuel is made by the consignee. If the consignor transfers ownership in the taxable liquid fuel to the consignee before sale of the liquid fuel by the consignee, the consignee is the person liable for the tax upon a subsequent taxable sale of the liquid. However, if ownership of the liquid fuel is transferred back to the consignor or to another person before a taxable sale is made, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, and thereafter a taxable sale of the liquid fuel is made by such person or by another person acting as the person's agent, such person is liable for the tax. See paragraph (d) of § 48.4041-8 for definition of the term “taxable liquid fuel.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>Dual use of taxable liquid fuel.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Tax applies to all taxable liquid fuel sold for use or used as a fuel in the motor which is used to propel a diesel-powered vehicle or in the motor used to propel a motor vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft, even though the motor is also used for a purpose other than the propulsion of the vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft. Thus, if the motor of a diesel-powered highway vehicle or a motorboat operates special equipment by means of a power take-off or power transfer, tax applies to all taxable liquid fuel sold for this use or so used, whether or not the special equipment is mounted on the vehicle or boat. For example, tax applies to diesel fuel sold to operate the mixing unit on a concrete mixer truck if the mixing unit is operated by means of a power take-off from the motor of the vehicle. Similarly, tax applies to all taxable liquid fuel sold for use or used in a motor propelling a fuel oil truck even though the same motor is used to operate the pump (whether or not mounted on the truck) for discharging the fuel into customers' storage tanks. However, tax does not apply to liquid fuel sold for use or used in a separate motor to operate special equipment (whether or not the equipment is mounted on the vehicle). If the taxable liquid fuel used in a separate motor is drawn from the same tank as the one which supplies fuel for the propulsion of the vehicle, a reasonable determination of the quantity of taxable liquid fuel used in such separate motor or during such period is acceptable for purposes of application of the tax. This determination must be based, however, on the operating experience of the person using the taxable liquid fuel, and the taxpayer must maintain records which support the allocation used. Devices to measure the number of miles the vehicle has traveled, such as hubometers, may be used in making a preliminary determination of the number of gallons of fuel used to propel the vehicle. In order to make a final determination of the number of gallons of fuel used to propel the vehicle, there must be added to this preliminary determination the amount of fuel consumed while idling or warming up the motor preparatory to propelling the vehicle.</P>

              <P>For purposes of the regulations in this subpart, unless otherwise expressly indicated:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Highway.</E> The term “highway” includes any road (whether a Federal highway, State highway, city street, rural road, or otherwise) in the United States which is not a private roadway.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Highway vehicle</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “highway vehicle” means <PRTPAGE P="77"/>any self-propelled vehicle, or any trailer or semi-trailer, designed to perform a function of transporting a load over highways, whether or not also designed to perform other functions, but does not include a vehicle described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For purposes of this definition, a vehicle consists of a chassis, or a chassis and a body if the vehicle has a body, but does not include the vehicle's load. Therefore, in determining whether a vehicle is a “highway vehicle”, it is immaterial that the vehicle is designed to perform a highway transportation function for only a particular kind of load, such as passengers, furnishings and personal effects (as in a house, office, or utility trailer), a special type of cargo, goods, supplies, or materials, or, except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, machinery or equipment specially designed to perform some off-highway task unrelated to highway transportation. In the case of specially designed machinery or equipment, it is also immaterial, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, that such machinery or equipment is permanently mounted on the vehicle. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term “transport” includes the term “tow”. A vehicle which is not a highway vehicle within the meaning of this paragraph shall be treated as a non-highway vehicle for purposes of section 4041. Examples of vehicles that are designed to perform a function of transporting a load over the public highways are passenger automobiles, motorcycles, buses, and highway-type trucks, truck tractors, trailers, and semi-trailers.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Certain specially designed mobile machinery for nontransportation functions.</E> A self-propelled vehicle, or trailer or semi-trailer, is not a highway vehicle if it (A) consists of a chassis to which there has been permanentaly mounted (by welding, bolting, riveting, or other means) machinery or equipment to perform a construction, manufacturing, processing, farming, mining, drilling, timbering, or other operation similar to any one of the foregoing enumerated operations if the operation of the machinery or equipment is unrelated to transportation on or off the public highways, (B) the chassis has been specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage and mount (and a power source, where applicable) for the particular machinery or equipment involved, whether or not such machinery or equipment is in operation, and (C) by reason of such special design, such chassis could not, without substantial structural modification, be used as a component of a vehicle designed to perform a function of transporting any load other than that particular machinery or equipment or similar machinery or equipment requiring such a specially designed chassis.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Certain vehicles specially designed for off-highway transportation.</E> A self-propelled vehicle, or a trailer or semi-trailer, is not a highway vehicle if it is (A) specially designed for the primary function of transporting a particular type of load other than over the public highway in connection with a construction, manufacturing, processing, farming, mining, drilling, timbering, or other operation similar to any one of the foregoing enumerated operations, and (B) if by reason of such special design, the use of such vehicle to transport such load over the public highways is substantially limited or substantially impaired. For purposes of applying the rule of clause (b) of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), account may be taken of whether the vehicle may travel at regular highway speeds, requires a special permit for highway use, is overweight, overheight or overwidth for regular use, and any other relevant considerations. Solely for purposes of determinations under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), where there is affixed to the vehicle equipment used for loading, unloading, storing, vending, handling, processing, preserving, or otherwise caring for a load transported by the vehicle over the public highways, the functions are related to the transportation of a load over the public highways even though the functions may be performed off the public highways.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Certain trailers and semi-trailers specially designed to perform nontransportation functions off the public highways.</E> A trailer or semi-trailer is not a highway vehicle if it is specially designed to serve no purpose other than <PRTPAGE P="78"/>providing an enclosed stationary shelter for the carrying on of a function which is directly connected with and necessary to, and at the off-highway site of, a construction, manufacturing, processing, mining, drilling, farming, timbering, or other operation similar to any one of the foregoing enumerated operations, such as a trailer specially designed to serve as an office for such an operation.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Optional application.</E> For purposes of section 4041, if any rules existing immediately prior to January 13, 1977, would, if applicable, unequivocally resolve an issue involving the definition of a highway vehicle with respect to a period prior to such date, at the option of the taxpayer, such rules existing prior to such date shall be applied to resolve the issue for all periods prior to such date, and the rules of paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section, which define the term “highway vehicle”, shall not apply with respect to such issue for all periods prior to such date.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Diesel-powered highway vehicle.</E> The term “diesel-powered highway vehicle” means any highway vehicle (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) which is also a motor vehicle (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) and which uses diesel fuel (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) for propulsion purposes.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Motor vehicles.</E> The term “motor vehicle” includes all types of vehicles propelled by motor that are designed for carrying or towing loads from one place to another, regardless of the type of load or material carried or towed and whether or not the vehicle is registered or required to be registered for highway use. Included are fork lift trucks used to carry loads at railroad stations, industrial plants, warehouses, etc. The term does not include farm tractors, trench diggers, power shovels, bulldozers, road graders or rollers, and similar equipment which does not carry or tow a load; nor does it include any vehicle which moves exclusively on rails. For periods prior to January 6, 1977, a vehicle which is designed for towing, but not carrying, loads shall not be considered to be a motor vehicle.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Taxable liquid fuel.</E> The term “taxable liquid fuel” (or “taxable liquid”) means any liquid which is either—</P>
              <P>(1) Diesel fuel as defined in paragraph (e) of this section,</P>

              <P>(2) Products designated as kerosene, gas, oil, or fuel oil which do not fall within the specifications of both paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section are taxable as special motor fuel if sold or used as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Fuel used in the aircraft in noncommercial aviation.</E> The term “fuel used in an aircraft in noncommercial aviation” means any liquid (including any product taxable under section 4081) that is sold for use or used as a fuel in an aircraft in noncommercial aviation (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Registered.</E> The term “registered”, when used with reference to a highway vehicle, means—</P>
              <P>(1) Registered for highway use under the laws of any State, District of Columbia, or foreign country, or</P>
              <P>(2) Required to be registered for highway use under the law of the State, District of Columbia, or foreign country in which it is operated or situated. Any highway vehicle which is operated under a dealer's tag, license, or permit is considered to be registered. A highway vehicle is not considered to be “registered” solely because there has been issued a special permit for operation of the vehicle at particular times and under specified conditions. However, a highway vehicle which is required to be registered and which also has been issued a special permit for operation of the vehicle under specified conditions, such as carrying an oversized load, is still considered to be “registered”.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Noncommercial aviation.</E> The term “noncommercial aviation” means any use of an aircraft, other than in a business of transporting persons or property for compensation or hire by air. The term also includes any use of an aircraft, in a business described in the preceding sentence, which is properly allocable to any transportation exempt from taxes imposed by sections 4261 (transportation of persons) and 4271 (transportation of property) by reason of section 4281 (use of small aircraft on nonestablished lines) or 4282 (transportation of members of affiliated group).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemption for farm use.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax imposed by section 4041 does not apply to diesel fuel or special motor fuel, or fuel used in noncommercial aviation, sold for use or used on a farm in the United States for farming purposes. The tax applies in the case of diesel fuel delivered into the fuel supply tank of a highway vehicle, or special motor fuel delivered into the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or motorboat, even if it is known that the liquid fuel is to be used on a farm for farming purposes. Credit or refund of the tax paid in such case may be claimed as provided by section 6427(c) upon proof that the taxable liquid was used on a farm for farming purposes. A tax-free sale of fuel delivered into the fuel supply tank of an aircraft in noncommercial aviation where such fuel is to be used on the farm for farming purposes may be made only if the requirements of § 48.4041-11 are met. The terms “used on a farm for farming purposes”, and related terms, have the same meaning for purposes of the exemption in section 4041(f) and the regulations in this section as these terms are defined in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of section 6420(c) and the regulations contained in § 48.6420-4.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application of exemption.</E> The exemption referred to in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply with respect to diesel fuel or special motor fuel or fuel used in noncommercial aviation sold for use or used for nonfarming purposes, or diesel fuel or special motor fuel or fuel used in noncommercial aviation sold for use or used off a farm, regardless of the nature of the use. Thus, if a vehicle, motorboat, or aircraft is used both on a farm and off the farm, or if it is used on a farm both for farming and nonfarming purposes, the exemption applies only with respect to that portion of the diesel fuel or special motor fuel or fuel used in noncommercial aviation which is sold for use or used “on a farm for farming purposes”. For purposes of this exemption, it is immaterial <PRTPAGE P="80"/>whether or not a vehicle is registered for highway use. However, the actual use of the vehicle and the place where it is used are material. For example, if a truck used on a farm for farming purposes is also used on the highways (even though in connection with operating the farm), tax applies to that diesel fuel or special motor fuel which is sold for use or used in operating the truck on the highways, since the fuel was used off the farm.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of exemption.</E> The exemption referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply on and after October 1, 1988.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application of exemption.</E> The tax imposed by section 4041 does not apply to any fuels which are sold for use or used as supplies for vessels or aircraft within the meaning of section 4221(a)(3) and (d)(3), and § 48.4221-4. In the case of a liquid sold for use as fuel in an aircraft, a tax-free sale may be made only if the requirements of § 48.4041-11 are met. For credit or refund of tax paid on fuels which have been sold or used as supplies for vessels or aircraft, see section 6416(b)(2)(B), section 6427, and paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Evidence required to establish exemption.</E> (1) In order to establish exemption from tax in the case of a sale of fuels for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, it is necessary that the seller obtain from the owner, charterer, or authorized agent of the vessel or aircraft and retain in its possession a property executed exemption certificate in the form prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section. If fuel is sold tax free for use as supplies for civil aircraft employed in foreign trade or in trade between the United States and any of its possessions, the exemption certificate must show the name of the country in which the aircraft is registered.</P>
              <P>(2) If only occasional sales of fuels are made to a purchaser for use which is exempt from tax as provided in this section, a separate exemption certificate must be furnished for each order. However, if sales are regularly or frequently made to a purchaser for such exempt use, a certificate covering all orders for a specified period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters is acceptable. Such certificates and proper records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be kept for inspection by the district director as provided in section 6001. If a seller's records with respect to any sale claimed to be tax free do not include a proper certificate, with supporting invoices and such other evidence as may be necessary to establish the exempt character of the sale, tax is payable by the seller on the sale.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Acceptable form of exemption certificate.</E> The following form of exemption certificate, which must be adhered to in substance, is acceptable for the purposes of this section.</P>

If fuel is purchased tax paid for use in noncommercial aviation but is used for a nontaxable purpose, see section 6427(a) for provisions relating to refunds or credits of tax for tax-paid fuels not used for the purpose for which sold. Any person desiring to be registered in order to sell or purchase fuel free of the tax imposed by section 4041(c) must, before making any tax-free sale or purchase, file Form 637A, in duplicate. Form 637A must be filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which the principal place of business of <PRTPAGE P="82"/>the applicant is located (or if the applicant has no principal place of business in the United States, with the Director of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20224).

              <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a separate exemption certificate must be furnished for each sale of fuel delivered into a fuel supply tank of an aircraft. If a portion of the fuel is intended to be used for a nontaxable purpose, the entire amount of the fuel may be sold tax free. Exemption certificates and proper supporting records such as invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be readily accessible for inspection by internal revenue officers and retained as provided in section 6001 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.</P>

              <P>(4) If the purchaser of fuel to be used in an aircraft has reasonable grounds <PRTPAGE P="83"/>to believe that 90 percent or more of the total of the fuel to be purchased by it during a specified period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters will be used in a tax-free use, it may furnish each of its suppliers an exemption certificate covering all purchases for the specified period. The certificate shall be substantially in the same form as the certificate in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, except that in place of the date the purchaser shall specify the period covered by the certificate, and the purchaser shall give a brief explanation of its grounds for belief that 90 percent or more of its total fuel will be used in a tax-free use.</P>
              <P>(5) The presumption under section 4041(i) that any liquid delivered into a fuel supply tank of an aircraft is taxable places the duty on the seller of the liquid fuel to use reasonable diligence to satisfy itself that a tax-free sale of fuel to the purchaser is allowed by law. In the absence of circumstances surrounding a sale that would raise a question as to whether a tax-free sale is allowable, the requirement of reasonable diligence is satisfied if the seller receives and retains the required certificate evidencing the right of the purchaser to buy the fuel tax free. However, if the circumstances are such as to indicate the seller has failed to use reasonable diligence, it is not relieved of liability for the tax imposed by section 4041(c). In addition, if the seller fails to obtain and retain the evidence of tax-free sales as required by this paragraph (d), it is not relieved of liability for the tax imposed by section 4041(c).</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Qualified methanol or ethanol fuel defined.</E> For purposes of section 4041(b)(2) and this section, qualified methanol or ethanol fuel is liquid motor fuel, 85% of the volume of which consists of alcohol, as defined in section 4081(c) and § 48.4081-2(a)(4) of the regulations as modified by the following sentence. For purposes of section 4041(b)(2) and this section, the alcohol contained in a qualified methanol or ethanol fuel may be produced from coal. The actual gallonage of each component of the mixture (without adjustment for temperature) shall be used in determining whether the 85 percent alcohol has been met. Further, in determining whether a particular mixture containing less than 85 percent alcohol satisfies this percentage requirement, the District Director shall take into account the existence of any facts and circumstances, that establish that but for the commercial and operational realities of the blending process, it may reasonably be concluded that the mixture would have contained at least 85 percent alcohol.

The amount of tax is based upon the total volume of fuel and not merely upon the nonalcohol portion of the fuel.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel defined.</E> For purposes of section 4041(m) and this section, partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel is liquid motor fuel, 85% of which by volume consists of alcohol, as defined in section 4081 and § 48.4081-2(a)(4) of the regulations, as modified by the following sentence. For purposes of section 4041(m) and this section, the alcohol contained in partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel must be produced from natural gas. The actual gallonage of each component of the mixture (without adjustment for temperature) shall be used in determining whether the 85 percent alcohol requirement has been met. Further, in determining whether a particular mixture containing less than 85 percent alcohol satisfies this percentage requirement, the District Director shall take into account the existence of any facts and circumstances that establish that but for the commercial and operational realities of the blending process, it may reasonably be concluded that the mixture would have contained at least 85 percent alcohol. The necessary facts and circumstances will not be found to exist if over a period of time the mixtures blended by a blender show a consistent pattern of failing to contain 85 percent alcohol. See paragraph (f) of this section for rules relating to information required to be attached to the taxpayer's return of the tax imposed by chapter 31 relating to the alcohol content of the partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel for which tax is paid.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mixtures which do not qualify as partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel.</E> If methanol or ethanol fuel does not qualify as partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel under this section, the entire mixture is taxed at the rate of tax applicable under section 4041(a)(2) of the Code.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Later blending.</E> If a partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel is blended with other motor fuel in a mixture less than 85 percent of which consists of alcohol, the subsequent sale or use of such blended motor fuel is taxable under the provisions of section 4041(a) or section 4081(a), subject to the requirements, limitations and exemptions of those sections.<PRTPAGE P="88"/>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Records required to be furnished by the taxpayer.</E> A taxpayer making a return of the tax imposed by chapter 31 indicating payment of the tax under section 4041(m) and § 48.4041-20 at the reduced rate must attach a statement to the return indicating the total number of gallons of partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel containing at least 85 percent alcohol and the total number of gallons of partially exempt methanol or ethanol fuel containing less than 85 percent alcohol, but qualifying for taxation at the reduced rate under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. However, the taxpayer does not have to specify the precise mixture ratio of every mixture blended for which tax is being paid.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> Section 4041(m) applies to sales and uses after July 31, 1984.

              <SUBJECT>Tax on fuel used in commercial waterway transportation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4042(a) imposes an excise tax on the use of liquid fuel in the propulsion system of commercial transportation vessels while traveling on certain inland and intracoastal waterways (<E T="03">see</E> § 48.4042-1 (f)). The tax applies generally to all types of vessels, including ships, barges, and tugboats. It is in addition to all other taxes imposed on the sale or use of fuel.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of tax.</E> For the amount of tax, see section 4042(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Person liable for tax.</E> The person operating the vessel in which the propulsion fuel is consumed is the user of liquid fuel for purposes of section 4042(a). Thus, a person who operates (or whose employees operate) a vessel is responsible for filing returns and paying the tax. If a vessel owner (or lessee) contracts with an independent contractor to operate the vessel, the independent contractor is the user of liquid fuel for purposes of section 4042(a), regardless of who purchases the fuel.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time of use.</E> Fuel is not taxed by section 4042(a) when put into a vessel's tanks. For purposes of section 4042(a), fuel is used when it is actually consumed by a vessel's engine.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Liquid fuel.</E> For purposes of the tax imposed under this section, liquid fuel means any liquid fuel including gasoline, diesel fuel, special motor fuel, or Bunker C residual fuel oil.<PRTPAGE P="90"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Commercial waterway transportation</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of section 4042(a) and § 48.4042-2(c)(1), the term “commercial waterway transportation” means the use of a vessel on the waterways specified in paragraphs (g) (1) through (27) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(i) Use of the vessel is in the business of transporting property for compensation or hire, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Use of the vessel is in transporting property in the business of the owner, lessee, or operator of the vessel (whether or not a fee is charged).</P>
              <FP>Except for the operation of certain fishing vessels, the operation of all vessels satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this section will be deemed “commercial waterway transportation,” regardless of whether the vessel is actually engaged in the transportation of property on a particular voyage. Thus, “commercial waterway transportation” includes the operation of vessels while moving empty of cargo, while awaiting passage through locks, while dislodging vessels grounded on a sandbar, while moving to or from a repair facility, while maneuvering around loading and unloading docks, and while fleeting barges into a single tow.</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Fishing vessels exception.</E> A vessel does not transport property in the business of the owner, lessee, or operator, for purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, by merely transporting fish or other aquatic animal life caught on the voyage. The tax imposed by section 4042(a) does not apply to fuel used by a fishing vessel while traveling to a fishing site, while engaged in fishing, or while returning from the fishing site with its catch. However, the tax applies to fuel used by a commercial vessel along the taxable waterways while traveling to pick up aquatic animal life caught by another vessel and while transporting the catch of such other vessel.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Specified waterways.</E> Only fuel used on those waterways specified in section 206 of the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 (specified waterways) is taxable. The specified waterways are as follows:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special rules.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Dual use of liquid fuels</E>—(1) <E T="03">Dual use by the propulsion engine.</E> The tax imposed by section 4042(a) applies to all taxable liquid used as a fuel in the propulsion system of the vessel, regardless of whether the engine (or other propulsion system) is used for a purpose other than propulsion of the vessel. For purposes of this section, any engines generating movement of a vessel (including bow thrusters used for steering) are part of the propulsion system. The tax does not apply to fuel consumed in engines which are not used to generate movement of a vessel. When the propulsion engine operates special equipment by means of a power take-off or <PRTPAGE P="92"/>power transfer, the tax applies to all liquid fuel consumed by that engine. For example, the tax applies to all fuel used in the engine operating an alternator, a generator, or pumps, if that engine is used to generate movement of a vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Common tank.</E> If the liquid fuel consumed by a nonpropulsion engine is drawn from the same tank as fuel consumed by a propulsion engine, a reasonable determination of the quantity of fuel used in such a separate engine will be acceptable for purposes of excluding from taxation a portion of the fuel consumed by the vessel. The determination of the amount of fuel consumed by the nonpropulsion engine may be based primarily on the operating experience of the person using the fuel; however, in order to exclude fuel from taxation under the rule set out in this paragraph (a)(2), the taxpayer must maintain records which will support the allocation used.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Voyages crossing boundaries of the specified waterways.</E> Fuel consumed by a vessel traveling along the specified waterways is taxable only to the extent of fuel consumed for propulsion while on the specified waterways. Generally, the operator may calculate the amount of fuel consumed while on the specified waterways during a particular voyage by mulitplying total fuel consumed in the propulsion engine by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the time spent operating on the specified waterways; the denominator is the total time spent operating on the specified and nonspecified waterways during the voyage. This calculation may not be used when it is unreasonable. It may be determined to be unreasonable by:</P>
              <P>(1) Better evidence of fuel consumed (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> readings from an accurate fuel gauge or records from similar voyages); or</P>
              <P>(2) The existence of factors causing a substantial discrepancy between the rate of fuel consumption on the specified and nonspecified waterways.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Records required.</E> (1) All operators of vessels used in commercial waterway transportation must maintain records sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the district director the amount of fuel used for taxable purposes. Those records may include, when relevant to establish liability:</P>
              <P>(i) Quantity of fuel and date of acquisition of all liquid fuels acquired for both taxable and nontaxable purposes, whether delivered to storage tanks or tanks on a vessel;</P>
              <P>(ii) Date and quantity of fuel pumped into tanks on each vessel;</P>
              <P>(iii) Identification number or name of each vessel using fuel; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Departure time, departure point, route traveled, destination, and arrival time for each vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) Vessel operators seeking a tax exemption provided by section 4042(c) must maintain records which will support any exemption claimed. Where applicable, the records shall contain:</P>
              <P>(i) The draft of the vessel on each voyage (for exemption under section 4042(c)(1));</P>
              <P>(ii) The type of vessel in which fuel is consumed and the type of vessel in which cargo is transported (for exemption under section 4042(c) (1), (2) or (4); and</P>
              <P>(iii) The ultimate use of cargo transported (for exemption under section 4042(c)(3)).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Certain types of commercial waterway transportation excluded.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Deep draft ocean-going vessels</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Under section 4042(c)(1), there is no tax imposed by section 4042(a) if:</P>
              <P>(i) The vessel was designed primarily for use on the high seas; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The vessel has a draft of more than 12 feet on the voyage for which the fuel tax exclusion is sought (<E T="03">e.g.</E> 12 feet 1 inch).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Meaning of “designed primarily for use on the high seas.”</E> Section 4042(c)(1) requires a determination of the primacy of the design features rendering the vessel useful for service on the high seas, as opposed to the features which render the vessel useful for service on all less turbulent waters. Thus, whether a ship is “designed primarily for use on the high seas” must be determined from all the facts, including structural <PRTPAGE P="93"/>features and equipment. If the predominant use of a vessel is on the high seas, it shall be presumed to be “designed primarily for use on the high seas.” If the predominant use of a vessel is on waters other than the high seas, it shall be presumed not to be “designed primarily for use on the high seas.”</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Meaning of “high seas.”</E> For purposes of this section, “high seas” shall mean waters other than the territorial waters of the United States or any other country. Thus, the high seas shall not include the internal waters of any country, the Great Lakes, harbors, or narrow coastal indentations.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Twelve foot draft</E>—(i) <E T="03">Definition.</E> For purposes of section 4042(c)(1), “draft” shall mean the maximum vertical distance between the mean water line and the bottom of the keel. In cases where a vessel has a skeg or other appendage extending locally below the line of the keel, the draft shall be measured from the deepest appendage. A separage determination of draft must be made for each voyage when the vessel has its greatest load of cargo and fuel. For purposes of this determination, the term “voyage” means a round trip voyage. Therefore, if a vessel travels into the specified waterway system to pick up cargo and has a draft sufficient to qualify for the exclusion when loaded, then for purposes of section 4042(c)(1) the vessel satisfies the 12 foot draft requirement for the entire voyage. Similarly, if a vessel loaded with cargo travels into the specified waterway system with a draft sufficient to qualify for the exclusion provided by section 4042(c)(1), then the fuel consumed on the entire voyage may be excluded, regardless of the vessel's draft after the cargo is unloaded.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example.</E> The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                <P>A ship with a design draft of 20 feet (maximum certified draft when fully loaded) travels into a taxable waterway with only a partial load, such that the draft is 12 feet. The ship unloads and departs the waterway empty. The portion of the fuel consumed for propulsion of the vessel on the specified waterway is taxable because only vessels with a draft greater than 12 feet are eligible for the section 4042(c)(1) exemption from tax.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Commercial passenger vessels.</E> Under section 4042(c)(2), the tax imposed by section 4042(a) does not apply to fuel consumed by vessels used primarily for the transportation of persons. Thus, commercial passenger vessels while being operated as passenger vessels are not subject to tax, even if such vessels in fact transport property in addition to transporting passengers. Similarly, ferry boats carrying passengers are not subject to tax, even if such vessels carry the passengers' automobiles.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemption for State or local governments</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Under section 4042(c)(3), there is no tax imposed by section 4042(a) if:</P>
              <P>(i) The vessel is being used by a State or local government; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The vessel is being used in transporting property in the State or local government's business.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">State or local government.</E> For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section a “vessel is being used by a State or local government” if it is operated by any State, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision of a State. If a private party is contracted to haul for a State or local government, the vessel is not “being used by a State or local government.” Similarly, if a person other than a State or local government is contracted to supply vessel operators, the fuel consumed by the vessel is not used “by a State or local government,” regardless of ownership of the vessel. However, when a local government leases barges and employees of the local government operate the barges, the vessel is being used by the local government.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Government business.</E> The test for whether a vessel is being used “in transporting in a State or local government's business,” within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, is whether the ultimate use of the cargo is for a function which is ordinarily carried out by governmental units. For example, when the cargo transported is salt to be spread on icy roads, the vessel is being used “in transporting in a State or local business” because the use to which the cargo will be put (road maintenance) is a function ordinarily performed by governmental units. Fuel consumed in a vessel transporting <PRTPAGE P="94"/>property for compensation or in furtherance of a business not ordinarily carried out by a governmental unit is not exempt from taxation by section 4042(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Ocean-going barges.</E> Under section 4042(c)(4), the tax imposed by section 4042(a) does not apply to fuel consumed by tugs moving exclusively barges released by ocean-going carriers solely to pick up or deliver international cargos. The tax exemption provided by section 4042(c)(4) applies to LASH barges, SEABEE barges, and all other ocean-going barges carried aboard ocean-going vessels. There is no exemption under section 4042(c)(4) while:</P>
              <P>(1) One or more of the barges in the tow is not a LASH barge, SEABEE barge, or other ocean-going barge carried aboard on ocean-going vessel; or</P>
              <P>(2) One or more of the barges in the tow is not on an international voyage; or</P>
              <P>(3) Part of the cargo in the tow is not being transported internationally.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Imposition of tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4061(a)(1) imposes a tax on the sale by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the following articles (including in each case parts and accessories therefor sold on or in connection therewith or with the sale thereof):</P>
                <P>(i) Automobile truck and bus chassis and bodies;</P>
                <P>(ii) Truck and bus trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Tractors of the kind chiefly used for highway transportation in combination with a trailer or semitrailer.</P>
                <FP>For purposes of this section, a sale of an automobile truck or bus, or a truck or bus trailer or semitrailer, shall be considered to be a sale of a chassis and of a body enumerated in this paragraph (a)(1).</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule applicable to chassis and bodies.</E> A chassis or body enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is taxable under section 4061(a)(1) only if such chassis or body is, within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section, sold for use as a component part of a highway vehicle (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), which is an automobile truck or bus, a truck or bus trailer or semitrailer, or a tractor of the kind chiefly used for highway transportation in combination with a trailer or semitrailer. Furthermore, a chassis or body which is not enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not taxable under section 4061(a)(1) even though such chassis or body is used as a component part of a highway vehicle (e.g., a chassis or body of a passenger automobile).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Equipment installed on chassis or bodies.</E> (i) For purposes of the tax imposed by section 4061(a)(1), equipment or machinery installed on a taxable <PRTPAGE P="95"/>chassis or body is considered to be an integral part of the taxable chassis or body if the machinery or equipment contributes toward the highway transportation function of the chassis or body, regardless of whether separate sales of the machinery or equipment would be subject to the tax on automotive parts or accessories imposed by section 4061(b). Therefore, the amount of the sale price of a taxable chassis or body that is attributable to such machinery or equipment must be included in the tax base when computing the tax due on a manufacturer's or importer's sale or use of a taxable chassis or body. Examples of the type of machinery or equipment that contribute to the highway transportation function of a chassis or body are the following: Loading and unloading equipment; towing winches; and all other machinery or equipment contributing to either the maintenance or safety of the vehicle, the preservation of cargo (other than refrigeration units), or the comfort or nvenience of the driver or passengers.</P>
                <P>(ii) Amounts charged for machinery or equipment that is installed on a taxable chassis or body are not part of the taxable sale price of the chassis or body if (A) such machinery or equipment does not contribute toward the highway transportation function of the chassis or body and (B) the reasonableness of the charge for the machinery or equipment is supportable by adequate records. Examples of such machinery or equipment are the following: equipment designed to spread materials on the highway; machinery or equipment used solely in the operation of mobile amusement rides; television equipment mounted in a mobile television studio; machine shop equipment mounted in a mobile machine shop; and car crushing equipment mounted on the chassis of a mobile car crusher.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Passenger automobile chassis and bodies, motorcycles, etc.</E> No tax is imposed under section 4061(a) on the sale of a motorcycle or, in the case of a sale made after December 10, 1971, on the sale of automobile chassis and bodies not enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or of trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies suitable for use in combination with passenger automobiles. For tax on certain sales made after December 31, 1958, and before December 11, 1971, see paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of price subject to tax.</E> The tax is computed by applying to the price for which the article is sold the rate in effect at the time of the sale. For definition of the term “price” and for application of the tax to leases of articles, see sections 4216 and 4217, respectively, and the regulations thereunder. If an article subject to tax under section 4061(a) has equipment mounted thereon to perform functions other than in connection with the transportation of persons or property, no tax under section 4061(a) attaches to that part of the selling price of the completed unit which is reasonably attributable to such equipment provided such part of the selling price is billed separately on the invoice to the customer or can otherwise be established by adequate records. For other rules relating to the sale of parts or accessories in connection with the sale of a chassis, body, or completed unit, see § 48.4061(a)-4. For special rules relating to the determination of selling price <PRTPAGE P="96"/>when equipment or machinery is permanently installed on a taxable chassis or body, see paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Tax on trailers sold before December 11, 1971.</E> With respect to sales made after December 31, 1958, and before December 11, 1971, the rate of tax imposed under section 4061(a) on a trailer or semitrailer chassis or body that is a highway vehicle within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section depends upon a classification of the article. The sale during this period of a trailer or semitrailer chassis or body (other than a house trailer) suitable for use in combination with passenger automobiles is subject ot tax as set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. A trailer suitable for use in combination with a passenger automobile which is designed for purposes other than living or sleeping, commonly referred to as a “utility trailer”, is an example of a trailer taxable at the 7 percent rate set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The sale of a trailer or semitrailer chassis or body that is not suitable for use in combination with passenger automobiles is subject to tax as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Passenger automobile chassis and bodies and related articles sold before December 11, 1971.</E> With respect to the sale after December 31, 1958, and before December 11, 1971, of (i) automobile chassis and bodies not enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or (ii) trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies suitable for use in combination with passenger automobiles, the tax imposed by section 4016(a) is computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section at the rate of 10 percent for sales prior to June 22, 1965, and at the rate of 7 percent thereafter.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Liability for tax.</E> The tax imposed by section 4061(a) is payable by the manufacturer, producer, or importer making the sale.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Highway vehicle</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> For purposes of this subchapter, the term “highway vehicle” means any self-propelled vehicle, or any trailer or semitrailer, designed to perform a function of transporting a load over public highways, whether or not also designed to perform other functins, but does not include a vehicle described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. For purposes of this definition, a vehicle consists of a chassis, or a chassis and a body if the vehicle has a body, but does not include the vehicle's load. Therefore, in determining whether a vehicle is a “highway vehicle”, it is immaterial that the vehicle is designed to perform a highway transportation function for only a particular kind of load, such as passengers, furnishings and personal effects (as in a house, office, or utility trailer), a special type of cargo, goods, supplies, or materials, or, except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, machinery or equipment specially designed to perform some off-highway task unrelated to highway transportation. In the case of specially designed machinery or equipment, it is also immaterial, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, that such machinery or equipment is permanently mounted on the vehicle. For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the term “transport” includes the term “tow”, and the term “public highway” includes any road (whether a Federal highway, State highway, city street, or otherwise) in the United States which is not a private roadway. A vehicle which is not a highway vehicle within the meaning of this paragraph shall be treated as a nonhighway vehicle for purposes of this subchapter. Examples of vehicles that are designed to perform a function of transporting a load over the public highways are passenger automobiles, motorcycles, buses, and highway-type trucks, truck tractors, trailers, and semi-trailers.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Certain specially designed mobile machinery for nontransportation functions.</E> A self-propelled vehicle, or trailer or semi-trailer, is not a highway vehicle if it (A) consists of a chassis to which there has been permanently mounted (by welding, bolting, riveting, or other means) machinery or equipment to perform a construction, manufacturing, processing, farming, mining, drilling, timbering, or operation similar to any one of the foregoing enumerated operations if the operation of the machinery or equipment or equipment is unrelated to transportation on or off the public highways, <PRTPAGE P="97"/>(B) the chassis has been specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage and mount (and a power source, where applicable) for the particular machinery or equipment involved, whether or not such machinery or equipment is in operation, and (C) by reason of such special design, such chassis could not, without substantial structural modification, be used as a component of a vehicle designed to perform a function of transporting any load other than that particular machinery or equipment or similar machinery or equipment requiring such a specially designed chassis.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Certain vehicles specially designed for offhighway transportation.</E> A self-propelled vehicle, or a trailer or semitrailer, is not a highway vehicle if it is (A) specially designed for the primary function of transporting a particular type of load other than over the public highway in connection with a construction, manufacturing, processing, farming, mining, drilling, timbering, or operation similar to any one of the foregoing enumerated operations, and (B) if by reason of such special design, the use of such vehicle to transport such load over the public highways is substantially limited or substantially impaired. For purposes of applying the rule of (B) of this subdivision, account may be taken of whether the vehicle may travel at regular highway speeds, requires a special permit for highway use, is overweight, overheight or overwidth for regular use, and any other relevant considerations. Soley for purposes of determinations under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), where there is affixed to the vehicle equiplment used for loading, unloading, storing, vending, handling, processing, preserving, or otherwise caring for a load transported by the vehicle over the public highways, the functions are related to the transportation of a load over the public highways even though such functions may be performed off the public highways.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Certain trailers and semi-trailers specially designed to perform non-transportation functions off the public highways.</E> A trailer or semi-trailer is not a highway vehicle if it is specially designed to serve no purpose other than providing an enclosed stationary shelter for the carrying on of a function which is directly connected with and necessary to, and at the off-highway site of, a construction, manufacturing, processing, mining, drilling, farming, timbering, or operation similar to any one of the foregoing enumerated operations such as a trailer specially designed to serve as an office for such an operation.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Optional application.</E> For purposes of this subchapter, if any rules existing immediately prior to January 13, 1977 would, if applicable, unequivocally resolve an issue involving the definition of a highway vehicle with respect to a period prior to such date, at the option of the taxpayer, such rules existing prior to such date shall be applied to resolve the issue for all periods prior to such date, and the rules of paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section, which define the term “highway vehicle”, shall not apply with respect to such issue for all periods prior to such date.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Highway vehicles not subject to section 4061 tax.</E> Although for purposes of this paragraph (d) passenger automobiles, automobile trailers and semitrailers, motor homes, motorcycles, light-duty trucks, etc., will be considered to be highway vehicles because they are designed to perform a function of transporting a load over public highways, the tax imposed under section 4061(a) does not apply to the sale of such vehicles because they either are not articles subject to tax under such section or are excluded from tax under section 4061 (a)(2). See also paragraphs (a)(4) and (f) of this section. Despite the fact that passenger automobiles, passenger automobile trailers and semi-trailers, motor homes, motorcycles, light-duty trucks, etc., are not subject to the manufacturers excise tax on highway vehicles imposed by section 4061(a), the fact that they are nevertheless considered highway vehicles for purposes of this subchapter can be of material significance in determining the applicability of such excise taxes as the tax imposed by section 4041 (relating to diesel and special motor fuels), the tax imposed by section 4071(a)(1) (relating to tires of the type used on highway vehicles), or the tax imposed by section 4481 (relating to highway use tax on highway <PRTPAGE P="98"/>motor vehicles). In addition, the definition of the term “highway vehicle” is material in determining the credits or refunds provided by section 6416(b)(2)(I) (relating to diesel fuel used in certain highway vehicles), section 6421(a) (relating to gasoline used for a nonhighway purpose), section 6424 (relating to lubricating oil used otherwise than in a highway motor vehicle), and section 6427(a) (relating to diesel or special motor fuel not used for a taxable purpose).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Sale of a chassis or body for use as a component of a vehicle other than a highway vehicle</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(4), (e)(2), or (f) of this section, the sale of a chassis or body shall be deemed to be a sale of a chassis or body enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if such chassis or body is, in any sense, reasonably suitable for use as a component part of a highway vehicle that is either an automobile truck or bus, a truck or bus trailer or semitrailer, or a tractor of the kind chiefly used for highway transportation in combination with a trailer or semitrailer.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions based on unitary concept</E>—(i) <E T="03">Completed vehicles not qualifying as highway vehicles.</E> With respect to the sale of a vehicle after January 13, 1977 which would otherwise be treated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section as a sale of a chassis or body enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the tax imposed under section 4061(a) shall not apply to such sale if the vehicle (considered as a completed unit) is not considered to be a highway vehicle within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tax-free sales of chassis and bodies.</E> With respect to the sale after January 13, 1977 of a chassis or body (not including the sale of a completed vehicle described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section) which would otherwise be treated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section as a sale of a chassis or body enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the tax imposed under section 4061(a) shall not apply to such sale if the chassis or body is actually sold for use, or for resale for use, as a component part of a vehicle that is not a highway vehicle within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of determining the liability of the manufacturer or reseller for the tax imposed under section 4061(a), the test of the preceding sentence will be considered to be met if (A) the purchaser furnishes the statement set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section to the seller before the manufacturer files a return covering excise taxes for the period in which the sale was made, and (B) the manufacturer or reseller complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. However, even though the purchaser and manufacturer (or reseller) have complied with the foregoing, the tax imposed under section 4061(a), shall apply to such sale if the manufacturer or reseller has received a written notification (applicable with respect to such sale) from the Internal Revenue Service that sales of a specified type or types of chassis or bodies may not be made tax free pursuant to this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) until further notification. Any such notification issued by the Internal Revenue Service shall be effective only with respect to sales after the manufacturer has received such notification.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requirements to be met.</E> In order for a manufacturer or reseller to sell free of tax under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section an otherwise taxable chassis or body, the manufacturer or reseller must:</P>
                <P>(A) Retain in his possession the statement required to be furnished by the purchaser and such other evidence as may be furnished by the purchaser to support the tax-free sale. Such evidence shall be retained for at least 3 years from the due date of the tax that would be due if the transaction in question had been a taxable sale; and</P>
                <P>(B) Indicate on the invoice with respect to the sale of the chassis or body that the sale of such article is made free of tax under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Form of statement.</E> In order for an otherwise taxable chassis or body to be sold free of tax under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the purchaser must execute and furnish to the manufacturer or reseller a statement that <PRTPAGE P="99"/>substantially complies with the following form:</P>

                <P>(v) <E T="03">Refund or credit of overpayment.</E> If a purchaser furnished the manufacturer with the statement described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section after the time the manufacturer has filed a return covering excise taxes for the period in which the sale was made, the manufacturer must include the tax on the sale in his return for the period. However, in such case, if the conditions prescribed in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section are met, a claim for refund of the tax paid on such sale may be filed by the manufacturer on Form 843, or a credit taken on a subsequent return, in accordance with the provisions of sections 6402(a) and 6416(a) and § 48.6416(a)-1.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Cross reference.</E> For special rules relating to the sale by a manufacturer of a vehicle consisting of a tax-paid chassis and a body manufactured by him, see § 48.4061(a)-5.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Exclusion of light-duty trucks, buses, and related articles from tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> (i) No tax is imposed by section 4061(a)(1) on the sale after December 10, 1971, of the following articles, if suitable for use with a vehicle having a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less (as determined under paragraph (f)(3) of this section):</P>
                <P>(A) Automobile truck and bus chassis and bodies, and</P>
                <P>(B) Truck trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies, suitable for use with a trailer or semitrailer having a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less (as so determined).</P>

                <P>(ii) For purposes of this part, a chassis or body is suitable for use with a vehicle having a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less (hereafter referred to in this paragraph (f) as a “light-duty vehicle”) if such chassis or body is commonly used with such a vehicle or possesses actual, practical, and commercial fitness for such use. A truck or bus chassis, sold after December 10, 1971, which is suitable for use with a light-duty vehicle, is not subject to the tax imposed by section 4061(a)(1) regardless of the body actually mounted thereon. Similarly, a truck trailer or semitrailer chassis sold after such date, suitable for use with a trailer or semitrailer having a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less, which trailer or semitrailer is suitable for use in connection with a light-duty towing vehicle, is not subject to such tax regardless of the body actually mounted thereon. A truck or bus body, sold after such date, which is suitable for use with a light-duty vehicle, is not subject to such tax even though it may also be suitable for use with (and is actually a component of) a vehicle having a gross vehicle weight in excess of 10,000 pounds. Similarly, a truck trailer or semitrailer body sold after such date, suitable for use with a trailer or semitrailer having a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less, which trailer or semitrailer is suitable for use with a light-duty towing vehicle, is not subject to such tax even though it may <PRTPAGE P="100"/>also be suitable for use with (and is actually a component of) a trailer or semitrailer having a gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds, or is used in connection with a vehicle having a gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds.</P>
                <P>(iii) Where an exempt body is mounted on a taxable chassis, or a taxable body is mounted on an exempt chassis, the taxable chassis or taxable body, as the case may be, nevertheless remains subject to such tax, if the resulting vehicle is a highway vehicle as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iv) Where the modification of an article, exempt from tax when sold by the original manufacturer, constitutes further manufacture after the original manufacturer's sale, a tax may be imposed on the subsequent manufacturer's sale or use of the modified article.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Parts and accessories.</E> (i) The sale of a part or accessory which, if sold on December 10, 1971, would be subject to the tax imposed by section 4061(a)(1) as in effect at such time, is not subject to the tax imposed by section 4061(a)(1) as in effect after such date if:</P>
                <P>(A) It is sold by the manufacturer on or in connection therewith, or with the sale of, a vehicle enumerated in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section which is not subject to such tax, and</P>
                <P>(B) It is not a replacement part (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section).</P>
                <P>(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a part or accessory is considered sold with a vehicle if, as of the time the article is sold by the manufacturer, the part or accessory has been ordered from such manufacturer for use with the vehicle. Thus, for example, original equipment sold after December 10, 1971, with a light-duty vehicle, consisting of parts and accessories which are ordered from the manufacturer of the vehicle not later than the time at which such vehicle is sold by him (whether or not installed as of such time) are not subject to such tax. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a part is a replacement part, regardless of when ordered,if its use with a vehicle is as a replacement for a part of such vehicle. Therefore, spare parts or accessories sold separately or ordered with a light-duty truck are subject to the tax imposed on sales of parts or accessories by section 4061(b)(1), unless they are excluded from tax as articles used interchangeably between truck and passenger vehicles under the provisions of section 4061(b)(2).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Gross vehicle weight.</E> (i) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1) of this section gross vehicle weight means the maximum total weight of a loaded vehicle. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(3), such maximum total weight shall be the gross vehicle weight rating of the article (as manufactured) as secified or established by the manufacturer of the completed article, unless such rating is unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances in a particular case.</P>
                <P>(ii) A manufacturer must specify or establish a weight rating for each chassis, body, or vehicle sold by him after September 22, 1971, if such article requires no additional manufacture other than (A) the addition of readily attachable articles, such as tire or rim assemblies or minor accessories, (B) the performance of minor finishing operations, such as painting, or (C) in the case of a chassis, the addition of a body. If an article is specially manufactured to the purchaser's specifications, such specifications may be used to establish the gross vehicle weight of the article.</P>
                <P>(iii) A manufacturer shall maintian a record of the gross vehicle weight rating of each truck, bus, trailer, and semitrailer sold by him and excluded from the tax imposed by section 4061(a)(1) by reason of section 4061(a)(2) and this paragraph (f). For this purpose, a record of the serial number of each such article shall be treated as a record of the gross vehicle weight rating of the article if such rating is indicated by the serial number.</P>

                <P>(iv) If (A) the manufacturer's rating indicated in a label or identifying device affixed to an article, (B) the rating set forth in his sales invoice or warranty agreement, and (C) his advertised rating for that article (or two or more identical articles) are inconsistent, the highest of such ratings will be considered to be the manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating specified or established for purposes of the tax imposed by section 4061(a)(1).<PRTPAGE P="101"/>
                </P>
                <P>(v) With respect to articles sold after January 31, 1972, the manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating must take into account the strength of the chassis frame, the axle capacity and placement, and the spring, brake, rim, and tire capacities. The component with the lowest weight rating ordinarily shall be considered determinative of the gross vehicle weight. If the capacity of any of the readily attachable components (springs, brakes, rims, or tires) would otherwise be determinative of a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less, no readily attachable component will be taken into account in determining such rating unless the rating determined solely on the basis of the chassis frame or the total of the axle ratings is 12,000 pounds or less.</P>
                <P>(vi) For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(v) of ths section, the term “total of the axle ratings” means the sum of the maximum load carrying capability (capacity and placement) of the axles (without regard to springs, brakes, rims, and tires) and, in the case of a trailer or semitrailer, the weight, if any, that is to be borne by a vehicle used in combination with the trailer or semitrailer for which gross vehicle weight is determined.</P>

                    <E T="03">Bonds and other security.</E> (a) In any case in which bond or other security is not specifically required by law, the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation or specific instruction require, or authorize collectors of customs to require, such bonds or other security as he, or they, may deem necessary for the protection of the revenue or to assure compliance with any provision of law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service may be authorized to enforce.</P>
                  <P>(b) Whenever a bond is required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce, the Secretary of the Treasury may—</P>

                  <P>(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, prescribe the conditions and form of such bond, and fix the amount of penalty thereof, whether for the payment of liquidated damages or of a penal sum: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That when a consolidated bond authorized by paragraph 4 of this subsection is taken, the Secretary of the Treasury may fix the penalty of such bond without regard to any other provision of law, regulation, or instruction.</P>

                  <P>(3) Authorize the execution of a term bond the conditions of which shall extend to and cover similar cases of importations over such period of time, not to exceed one year, or such longer period as he may fix when in his opinion special circumstances existing in a particular instance require such longer period.</P>

A consolidated bond taken pursuant to the authority contained in this subsection shall have the same force and effect in respect of every provision of law, regulation, or instruction for the purposes for which it is required as though separate bonds had been taken to assure compliance with each such provision.</P>
                  <P>(c) The Secretary of the Treasury may authorize the cancellation of any bond provided for in this section, or of any charge that may have been made against such bond, in the event of a breach of any condition of the bond, upon the payment of such lesser amount or penalty or upon such other terms and conditions as he may deem sufficient.</P>
                  <P>(d) No condition in any bond taken to assure compliance with any law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce shall be held invalid on the ground that such condition is not specified in the law, regulation, or instruction authorizing or requiring the taking of such bond.</P>
                  <P>(e) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to permit the deposit of money or obligations of the United States, in such amount and upon such conditions as he may by regulation prescribe, in lieu of sureties on any bond required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce.</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) Facts pertaining to the importer's assets and liabilities which will aid the district director in determining whether a bond shall be required.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall have no application in any case where an article taxable under section 4061(a) is:</P>
                <P>(i) Incidentally imported by an individual for his personal use.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirement of bond</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the district director determines that a bond is necessary in order to insure payment of the tax under section 4061(a), and to assure compliance with all provisions of the Code and regulations thereunder, with respect to articles imported by any importer required to make application for a determination under paragraph (b) of this section, such bond shall be given by such importer. Such bond shall be submitted, in duplicate, to the district director for the district in which the importer will file returns of any tax under section 4061(a) for which he may incur liability.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Execution of bond</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The bond required under this paragraph shall be executed with satisfactory surety. (For provisions as to what will be considered “satisfactory surety”, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.) Such bond shall be conditioned that the principal shall not engage in any attempt, by himself or by collusion with others, to defraud the United States of any tax under section 4061(a); that he shall render truly and completely all returns, statements, and other documents required of him by law or regulations in respect of such tax; that he shall timely pay all such tax for which he is liable; and, in the case of any such tax in respect of an article released from customs custody by reason of such bond that he shall pay such tax whether the liability therefor is incurred by him or by some other person as the importer of the articles covered by the bond, unless such other person makes payment of such tax on or before the due date. The bond shall be in an amount which the district director believes to be sufficient to protect the interests of the United States with respect to all articles taxable under section 4061(a) which are released from customs custody by reason of such bond, but in no event shall the <PRTPAGE P="103"/>bond be in an amount less than the approximate amount of tax under section 4061(a) for which the principal may be expected to incur liability during an average calendar quarter. Such bond shall be signed by the individual, if the principal is an individual; the president, vice president, or other principal officer, if the principal is a corporation; a responsible and duly authorized member or officer having knowledge of its affairs, if the principal is a partnership or other unincorporated organization; or the fiduciary, if the principal is a trust or estate.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cancellation clause.</E> The bond required under this paragraph may be accepted with a cancellation clause incorporated therein. Such cancellation clause shall provide that:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Any surety on the bond may at any time give notice to the principal and the district director that he desires to be relieved of liability under said bond after a date named, which shall be at least 60 days after the receipt of notice by the district director.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) If the notice is not withdrawn in writing prior to the date named in the notice, the rights of the principal as supported by said bond shall be terminated on such date (unless supported by another bond or bonds). The surety shall, however, remain liable with respect to any tax under section 4061(a) (plus penalties and interest) the liability for which is incurred in respect of articles released from customs custody by reason of the bond.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Said notice may not be given by an agent of the surety, unless it is accompanied by power of attorney duly executed by the surety authorizing the agent to give such notice or by a verified statement that such power of attorney is on file with the Treasury Department.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Changes in bond.</E> After filing of the bond required under this paragraph, no change may be made in the terms thereof except with the consent of the surety or sureties and subject to the approval of the district director.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Satisfactory surety</E>—(i) <E T="03">Approved surety company or bonds or notes of the United States.</E> For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a bond shall be considered executed with satisfactory surety if:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) It is executed by a surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) It is secured by bonds or notes of the United States as provided in 6 U.S.C. 15 (see 31 CFR Part 225).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other surety acceptable in discretion of district director.</E> For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a bond may, in the discretion of the district director, be considered executed with satisfactory surety if, in lieu of being executed or secured as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, it is:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Executed by a corporate surety (other than a surety company), provided such corporate surety establishes that it is within its corporate powers to act as surety for another corporation or an individual;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Executed by two or more individual sureties, provided such individual sureties meet the conditions contained in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Secured by a mortgage on real or personal property;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) Secured by a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a United States postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) Secured by corporate bonds or stocks, or by bonds issued by a State or political subdivision thereof, of recognized stability; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">f</E>) Secured by any other acceptable collateral. Collateral shall be deposited with the district director or, in his discretion, with a responsible financial institution acting as escrow agent.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Conditions to be met by individual sureties.</E> If a bond is executed by two or more individual sureties, the following conditions must be met by each such individual surety:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) He must reside within the State in which the principal place of business or legal residence of the primary obligor is located;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) He must have property subject to execution of a current market value, above all encumbrances, equal to at least the penalty of the bond;<PRTPAGE P="104"/>
                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) All real property which he offers as security must be located in the State in which the principal place of business or legal residence of the primary obligor is located;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) He must agree not to mortgage, or otherwise encumber, any property offered as security while the bond continues in effect without first securing the permission of the district director; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) He must file with the bond, and annually thereafter so long as the bond continues in effect, an affidavit as to the adequacy of his security, executed on the appropriate form furnished by the district director.</P>
                <FP>Partners may not act as sureties upon bonds of their partnership. Stockholders of a corporate principal may be accepted as sureties provided their qualifications as such are independent of their holdings of the stock of the corporation.</FP>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Adequacy of surety.</E> No surety or security shall be accepted if it does not adequately protect the interest of the United States.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">New or additional bond.</E> The district director may require a new or additional bond under this section in any case where he deems it necessary or desirable in order to protect the interests of the United States.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of requirement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application for relief from requirement.</E> Any importer who has given bond as required under paragraph (c) of this section may make application for relief from such requirement at any time after the last day of the first month following the close of the calendar quarter in which the bond was given. Any such application shall be submitted to the district director to whom the bond was furnished and shall set forth such facts as will be of assistance to the district director in determining whether the relief shall be granted.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Relief from requirement.</E> In any case where the district director determines that the bond required under paragraph (c) of this section to be given by an importer is no longer necessary to insure payment of any tax under section 4061(a) for which liability may be incurred by such importer, such importer shall no longer be required to give such bond.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of evidence.</E> The evidence required under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be in the form of a statement, executed, signed, and dated by the district director. Such statement shall show the following:</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) If the articles are to be released from customs custody to a person other than the importer, the name and address of such other person.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) That the importer has given a bond which the district director finds sufficient to protect the interests of the United States with respect to any tax under section 4061(a) for which liability may be incurred in respect of such articles.</P>

                <FP>A statement under this subdivision shall be furnished to the importer by the district director, upon request of the importer, in every case where such importer furnishes the district director with information which establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that the importer has given bond in an amount sufficient to protect the interests of the United States with respect to any tax under section 4061(a) which <PRTPAGE P="105"/>may become due in respect of the articles to which the request relates, and with such other information as is required under this subdivision to be shown in the statement. Such request, together with such information, shall be submitted by the importer immediately upon receipt by him of notice that articles taxable under section 4061(a) have been exported to his order. A separate request shall be made in respect of each shipment. Each statement given under this subdivision shall be executed in duplicate. The original of such statement shall be furnished by the district director to the importer and the copy shall be retained by the district director.</FP>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">No bond required.</E> If the importer is not required to give bond under this section, the statement shall show:</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) That bond under this section is not required of such importer.</P>
                <FP>A statement under this subdivision shall be furnished to the importer by the district director on the date on which the district director determines that the importer is not required to give a bond under this section. Such statement shall be executed in triplicate. The original of such statement and one signed copy shall be furnished by the district director to the importer, and one copy shall be retained by the district director. Additional signed copies of such statement will be furnished by the district director to the importer upon request of the importer. However, once such statement, or a signed copy thereof, has been furnished by the importer to a collector of customs, the requirements imposed by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are deemed to be satisfied in respect of all articles taxable under section 4061(a) which thereafter arrive in the United States for release to or for the importer in a port under the jurisdiction of such collector of customs, until such time, if any, as such collector of customs receives written notification from the district director or the Commissioner of Customs that such statement has been withdrawn.</FP>

                <SUBJECT>Sale of automobile truck bodies and chassis.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Sale of completed vehicle.</E> An automobile truck (as defined by § 48.4061(a)-3(a)) for purposes of the tax imposed by section 4061(a) consists of two parts, namely, a body and a chassis. Generally, the tax applies to the sale by the manufacturer of each. Thus, if the purchaser of a tax-paid chassis attaches to it a taxable body manufactured by him and sells the completed vehicle, he is liable for tax based on the sale price of the body only. However, in such a case, the tax attaches to the selling price of the entire vehicle unless adequate records are available to show the portion of the total selling price attributable to the body.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cross references.</E> For special rules relating to the sale of a chassis or body to a purchaser who will use it in the manufacture or assembly of a nonhighway vehicle, see § 48.4061(a)-1(e). With respect to bodies sold to a chassis manufacturer, see also section 4063(b) and the regulations thereunder.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definition of parts or accessories.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “parts or accessories” includes (1) any article the primary use of which is to improve, repair, replace, or serve as a component part of an automobile truck or bus chasis or body, or other automobile chassis or body, or taxable tractor, (2) any article designed to be attached to or used in connection with such chassis, body, or tractor to add to its utility or ornamentation, and (3) any article the primary use of which is in connection with such chassis, body, or tractor, whether or not essential to its operation or use. The term “parts or accessories” includes all articles which have reached such a stage of manufacture as to be commonly known as parts or accessories whether or not fitting operations are required in connection with their installation. An article shall not be deemed to be a taxable part or accessory even though it is designed to be attached to the vehicle or to be primarily used in connection therewith if the article is in effect the load being transported and the primary function of the article is to serve a purpose unrelated to the vehicle as such. For example, a construction derrick attached to a truck is not a taxable part or accessory inasmuch as the derrick is the load of the truck and its use is in connection with construction work at a construction site rather than in connection with the transportation or loading or unloading function of the truck. On the other hand, an article such as a towing cradle or loading or unloading equipment designed to be attached to or to be primarily used in connection with a truck is a taxable part or accessory inasmuch as the articles contributes to the load-carrying function of the truck. The term “parts <PRTPAGE P="107"/>or accessories” does not include tires, inner tubes, or automobile radio or television receiving sets, since these articles are expressly exempted by section 4061(b) from the tax. However, the term “parts or accessories” includes tire valves designed for use on tires or tubes for articles taxable under section 4061(a).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Articles of a general use.</E> The term “parts or accessories” does not include articles which are not used primarily in the manufacture, repair, etc., of automobile trucks, other automobiles, or tractors, but have a general use in the manufacture, repair, etc., of various articles. For example, commodities such as ball and roller bearings, bolts, nuts, washers, screws, nails, tacks, rivets, pins, studs, cotters, pipe fittings such as plugs, tees, ells, and elbows, drain cocks, grease cups, oilers, and similar articles are not of themselves parts or accessories unless so constructed as to be used primarily in the manufacture, repair, etc., of automobile trucks, other automobiles, or tractors. On the other hand, parts for automobile parts or accessories are in themselves taxable unless they are articles of a type not specifically designed for use primarily in the automobile field. For example, the tax applies to the sale of gears, flexible shafts and flexible housings designed as replacement parts for automotive speedometers; as well as replacement parts for automobile engines, transmissions, differentials, steering mechanisms, timers, windshild-wiper motors, and other automobile parts or accessories.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Materials of a general use</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The term “parts or accessories” also does not include material such as glass, cloth, leather, matting linoleum, and other materials sold in rolls or by the foot, such as brake lining, tape, binding, wire, cable, metal and rubber tubing, packing, conduit, and similar material. However, except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, when any such material is cut or otherwise transformed by any person into an automobile part or accessory, tax attaches at the time such part or accessory is sold by such person.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Articles made for immediate installation or repair.</E> If in connection with an immediate installation in an automobile truck, other automobile, or tractor an article is produced through the use of special machinery or as a result of specialized skills from lengths or rolls of material, the person producing such article is considered to have manufactured an automobile part or accessory and the tax applies to his sale of such part or accessory. For example, tax applies to the sale of automobile glass cut to size to replace broken glass, or automobile seat covers, automobile floor mats, or fitted truck top covers produced to replace worn seat covers, floor mats, or truck top covers. However, if an article of a minor nature is produced by simple operation from lengths or rolls of material for immediate use by a repairman in the repair of an automobile truck, other automobile, or tractor on which he is then working, the person producing such article is not considered to have manufactured an automobile part or accessory and tax does not apply on his sale of such article. For example, tax does not apply where a wire, hose, or board is cut to size in order to replace a damaged wire, hose, or board of an automobile truck, other automobile, or tractor.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples of articles taxable as parts or accessories.</E> Examples of articles which are taxable as parts or accessories are: Automobile air conditioners; baby seats for automobiles; automobile beds; automobile hammocks; automobile clutches; bottle warmers and heating pads designed to operate from an automobile cigarette lighter; automobile radio antennae; automobile license plate frames; automobile clocks; automobile mirrors and mirror brackets; purses for carrying parking meter coins or cases for carrying registration cards when designed for attachment to an automobile; safes primarily designed for use in taxable motor vehicles; electric bulbs primarily designed and adapted for use on automobiles; automobile floor mats; jacks of the mechanical or hydraulic bumper, screw, ratchet, scissors, or other type primarily designed to be carried as accessories in automobiles as distinguished from jacks designed especially for use in garages and repair shops; dollies of the type commonly <PRTPAGE P="108"/>known as converter dollies which are used as connectors to convert semitrailers to full trailers; tool kits recommended for use with automobiles; automobile seat covers of any construction whether they are ready-made or custom fitted; fitted truck top covers; glass cut to size for installation in automobiles; and automobile bearings, such as automobile crankshaft or connecting rod bearings.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> This section shall be effective with respect to sales made on or after January 1, 1964. For the definition of parts or accessories applicable to sales thereof prior to such date, see § 40.4061(b)-2 of this chapter (Manufacturers and Retailers Excise Tax Regulations).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Rebuilt, reconditioned, or repaired parts or accessories.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Rebuilt parts or accessories.</E> Rebuilding of automobile parts or accessories, as distinguished from reconditioning or repairing, constitutes manufacturing, and the rebuilder of such parts or accessories is liable for the tax imposed by section 4061(b) with respect to his sales of such rebuilt parts or accessories. Reboring or other machining, rewinding, and comparable major operations constitute rebuilding. The person owning the part or accessory being rebuilt is the manufacturer of the article and is liable for the tax on his sale of the rebuilt part or accessory. The tax attaches whether the machining or other operation is performed by the rebuilder himself or by some other person in his behalf. For example, the tax attaches with respect to sales of (1) rebuilt batteries, (2) rebabbited or machined connecting rods, (3) reassembled clutches after operations such as the resurfacing of clutch plates, (4) rewound armatures, (5) reassembled generators with armatures rewound by or for the person reassembling the generator, (6) reground or remetalized crankshafts, and (7) engines in which blocks are machined (such as cylinders rebored or new sleeves inserted with or without cylinders being rebored) or new blocks installed. For provisions relating to the sale price of rebuilt parts or accessories, see § 48.4062(b)-1.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reconditioned parts or accessories.</E> The mere disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling (with any necessary replacements of worn parts) of automobile parts or accessories, such as fuel pumps, water pumps, carburetors, distributors, shock absorbers, windshield-wiper motors, brake shoes, clutch disks, voltage regulators, and other parts or accessories, are regarded as reconditioning operations rather than the manufacturing or production of rebuilt parts or accessories. The sale of a reconditioned part or accessory is not subject to tax if previous to the reconditioning there had been a prior sale of such part or accessory in the United States. Any new taxable parts or accessories produced, or purchased tax free for use in further manufacture, and used as replacements in reconditioning such units are subject to tax when used by the reconditioner.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Repaired parts or accessories.</E> The tax does not apply to the amount paid for the repair of automobile parts or accessories for the owner thereof. Repairing consists of the restoration, whether by rebuilding or reconditioning, of an owner's part or accessory to usable condition for his own use rather than for sale. The person who performs the repairing must retain in his possession evidence or documents from which the nontaxable nature of the operation can be ascertained. Any person engaged in rebuilding parts or accessories for purposes of sale incurs liability for tax with respect to his own use of any part or accessory rebuilt by him for sale.</P>

                <P>(ii) Such cement mixer was held by a dealer on January 1, 1970, for purposes of resale and was not used,</P>
                <FP>the manufacturer, producer, or importer is entitled to a credit or refund (without interest) of the amount of tax he paid on his sale of such cement mixer.</FP>

                <P>(3) <E T="03">Held by a dealer.</E> A cement mixer shall be considered as “held by a dealer” if title thereto has passed to the dealer (whether or not delivery to him has been made), and if for purposes of consumption title to the cement mixer or possession thereof had not at any time prior to January 1, 1970, been transferred to any person other than a dealer. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section and notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a cement mixer shall be considered as “held by a dealer” and not to have been used, although possession of such cement mixer has been transferred to another person, if such cement mixer is returned to the dealer in a transaction under which any amount paid or deposited by the transferee for such cement mixer is refunded to him (other than amounts retained by the dealer to cover damage to the cement mixer). Moreover, such a cement mixer shall be considered as held by a dealer on January 1, 1970, even though it was in the possession of the transferee on such day, if it was returned to the dealer (in a transaction described in the preceding sentence) before January 31, 1970. The determination as to the time title passes or possession is obtained for purposes of consumption shall be made under applicable local law. (See subdivisions (iii), (iv), and (v) of paragraph (b)(4) of § 145.2-1 of this subchapter for examples illustrating the provisions of this subparagraph.)</P>

L. 91-678) with respect to a claim for credit or refund under this section. With respect to claims for credit or refund under this section, the term “dealer request limitation date” and “claim limitation date” used in paragraphs (c) <PRTPAGE P="110"/>and (d) of § 48.6412-1 means July 31, 1971, and October 31, 1971, respectively.</P>

                <P>Under the provisions of section 4063(b), the tax imposed by section 4061(a) shall not apply to bodies sold by the manufacturer thereof to a manufacturer (but not an importer) of automobile trucks (as defined by § 48.4061(a)-3(a)) to be sold by the purchaser. Thus, a manufacturer of automobile truck bodies is permitted to sell such bodies tax free to manufacturers of automobile truck chassis. This section does not apply with respect to the sale of an automobile truck chassis to manufacturers of automobile truck bodies. However, see § 48.4061(a)-1(e) with respect to the sale of an automobile truck chassis for use in the manufacture or assembly of a nonhighway vehicle (within the meaning of § 48.4061(a)-1(d)). In order to effect a tax-free sale of a body as provided in this section, both the seller and purchaser must comply with the registration and other requirements of section 4222 and the regulations thereunder. A chassis manufacturer who purchases a body tax free as provided in this section shall, for purposes of application of the tax imposed by section 4061(a), be considered the manufacturer of such body.</P>

                <P>(3) <E T="03">Liability for tax.</E> The tax imposed by section 4064 is payable by the manufacturer making the sale. An automobile sold before the time a determination of fuel economy is made for the model type (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) is subject to tax if it is subsequently determined that the fuel economy level of that model type of automobile is within the taxable range (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Sale.</E> Sale includes the use (within the meaning of section 4218) or the first lease (within the meaning of section 4217(e)) of an automobile by the manufacturer.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Manufacturer.</E> The term “manufacturer” has the same meaning assigned to such term under § 48.0-2(a)(4). The term “manufacturer” includes a producer or importer. An importer is a person who imports an automobile whether or not in connection with a trade or business.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Automobile.</E> The term “automobile” means any four-wheeled vehicle—</P>
                <P>(i) Propelled by an engine powered by fuel;</P>
                <P>(ii) Manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways (except any vehicle operated exclusively on a rail or rails);</P>
                <P>(iii) Rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less; and</P>

                <P>(iv) Requiring no further manufacturing operations to perform its intended function, other than the addition of readily attachable components, such as mirrors or tire and rim assemblies, or minor finishing operations, such as painting. For this purpose, gross vehicle weight means the value specified by the manufacturer as the maximum design loaded weight of a <PRTPAGE P="114"/>single vehicle. An automobile does not include a nonpassenger automobile as defined in regulations in effect on November 9, 1978 (49 CFR 523.5 (1978)), which were prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation for section 501 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2001). In addition, an automobile does not include the following: any vehicle sold for use and used primarily as an ambulance or combination ambulance-hearse; any vehicle sold for use and used by the United States or by a State or local government primarily for police or other law enforcement purposes; or any vehicle sold for use and used primarily for firefighting purposes.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Model year.</E> The term “model year” means the manufacturer's annual production period (as determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency) which includes January 1 of any particular calendar year. If the manufacturer has no annual production year, the model year is the calendar year.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Model type.</E> The term “model type” means a particular class of automobile, as determined by regulations in effect on November 9, 1978 (40 CFR 600.002-79(a)(19) (1978)), which were prescribed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Fuel economy.</E> The term “fuel economy” means the average number of miles traveled by an automobile per gallon of fuel consumed, rounded to the nearest .1 mile per gallon. The fuel economy for any model type is determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (as determined in accordance with the procedures provided in paragraph (c) of this section). For this purpose, the fuel economy is a combined (urban-highway weighted average) mileage figure estimated in connection with the determination (or redetermination) of general label value (fuel economy information displayed on a sticker that is affixed to new automobiles) mandated under section 506 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2006) and regulations thereunder (40 CFR Part 600).</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Fuel.</E> The term “fuel” means gasoline and diesel fuel.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of fuel economy.</E> For purposes of this section, the fuel economy for any model type is determined (or redetermined) in accordance with the testing and calculation procedures utilized by the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator for model year 1975 (weighted 55 percent urban cycle and 45 percent highway cycle), or any other procedures (yielding comparable results) established by the Administrator. The Environmental Protection Agency's determination (or redetermination) of a model type's fuel economy is made at the time the general label fuel economy value is calculated (or recalculated). This determination (or redetermination) is conclusive for purposes of this section. A redetermination of a model type's fuel economy value shall be effective only with respect to those automobiles for which the manufacturer is required (or is permitted and chooses) under Environmental Protection Agency regulations to affix labels with the recalculated general label fuel economy value.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rule for small manufacturers</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A small manufacturer (as defined in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph) may apply for a determination that it is not feasible for that manufacturer to meet the statutory tax-free fuel economy level for the model year, with respect to all automobiles produced by that manufacturer, or with respect to a particular model type. For this purpose, the Commissioner (or his delegate) will make a determination of maximum feasible fuel economy level with respect to the automobiles that are the subject of the determination, but only after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (or their delegates) to obtain their views. A finding that it is not feasible for the manufacturer to meet the statutory tax-free fuel economy level will be made by the Internal Revenue Service if the maximum feasible fuel economy level (as defined in subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph) of the automobiles that are the subject of the determination is lower than the statutory tax-free fuel economy level <PRTPAGE P="115"/>for those automobiles. If it is determined that it is not feasible for a small manufacturer to meet the statutory tax-free fuel economy level, the Secretary (or his delegate) has the discretion to grant to the manufacturer the alternate rate schedule prescribed in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section in lieu of the applicable statutory tax table prescribed in section 4064(a). The decision whether to grant the alternate rate schedule shall be based on the consideration set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. If a small manufacturer for which an alternate rate schedule under this paragraph (d) is applicable sells an automobile to an importer, the alternate rate schedule applies to the sale by the importer of such automobile if such automobile is of the model year and type to which such alternate schedule applies.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Small manufacturer.</E> A small manufacturer is any manufacturer who produced (whether or not in the United States) fewer than 10,000 automobiles in the second model year preceding the affected model year (the model year for which the determination under this paragraph is being made), and who can reasonably be expected to produce (whether or not in the United States) fewer than 10,000 automobiles in the affected model year.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Manufacturer.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, the term “manufacturer” does not include a person who is only an importer, but does include a producer of automobiles outside the United States who is also an importer.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Members of a controlled group.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, persons who are members of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that “more than 50 percent” is substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a)) are treated as one manufacturer.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Basis for determination</E>—(i) <E T="03">Maximum feasible fuel economy level.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, the maximum feasible fuel economy level is determined by taking into account the same factors used in determining the maximum feasible fuel economy level under section 502(e) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (as amended) and the regulations thereunder in effect on November 9, 1978. (Those regulations for small manufacturers are prescribed in 49 CFR Part 525 (1978).) In making this determination, the Commissioner (or his delegate) will consult with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the Department of Transportation.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Decision to grant alternate rate schedule.</E> In deciding whether to grant an alternate rate schedule, the Secretary (or his delegate) will consider whether the use (in the United States) of the automobile serves an important public policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> providing public transportation or transportation for the handicapped) that overrides the United States' need to conserve energy. The manufacturer has the burden of demonstrating that the public policy consideration involved overrides the United States' need to conserve energy. The Commissioner (or his delegate), after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administratior of the Environmental Protection Agency (or their delegates), will review the information submitted by the manufacturer and report findings and recommendations to the Secretary (or his delegate).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Alternate rate schedule and tax.</E> If an alternate rate schedule is granted, the maximum feasible fuel economy level shall be deemed to be the statutory tax-free fuel economy level. Accordingly, a tax is imposed only on automobiles sold that fail to meet the deemed tax-free fuel economy level. The alternate rate schedule shall be determined by substituting the maximum feasible fuel economy level for the tax-free fuel economy level in the applicable statutory tax table set forth in section 4064(a), and by substituting for the miles per gallon amount prescribed in that applicable table an amount that is the tax-free level decreased by one mile per gallon increments, while keeping the same corresponding tax amount prescribed in the applicable table. The rule for determining an alternate rate schedule may be illustrated by the following example:

                  <P>Manufacturer X, a small manufacturer of automobiles specifically designed to accommodate disabled passengers, applied <PRTPAGE P="116"/>for a determination that it is not feasible for X to meet the statutory tax-free fuel economy level for a particular model type of X's 1982 model year automobiles. It was determined that the maximum feasible fuel economy level for that model type was 15 miles per gallon. The Secretary decided to grant X an alternate rate schedule. The alternate rate schedule for the model type would be as follows:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Imposition of tax on tires and tubes delivered to manufacturer's retail outlet.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If, on or after October 1, 1966, a tire or inner tube is delivered by the manufacturer thereof to a retail outlet of the manufacturer, the manufacturer is liable for tax in respect of the tire or tube at the rate set forth in section 4071 in the same manner as if the tire or tube had been sold at the time it was delivered to the retail outlet. The amount of tax payable shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of § 48.4071-1, and of § 48.4071-2.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of retail outlet.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “retail <PRTPAGE P="119"/>outlet” includes the term “retail store.” A retail outlet is a facility maintained by a manufacturer for selling tires or tubes at retail. A facility may be a retail outlet even though some sales are made at wholesale at such facility; see paragraph (d)(1) of this section. A facility may also be considered to a retail outlet for the purposes of this section notwithstanding that its main activity is in another area than selling tires or inner tubes. For example, if a manufacturer operates a facility for both automotive repair and the selling of tires at retail, the facility is considered a retail outlet for the purposes of this section even if the primary activity of the facility is automotive repair. No facility is considered a retail outlet for the purposes of this section if it is determined that less than 15 percent of the taxable tires and inner tubes removed from such facility are sold at retail by such facility. The determination described in the preceding sentence is made on the basis of the experience of a representative period, of at least 12 consecutive calendar months during the 2-year period immediately preceding the first day included in the return period for which tax under section 4071(b) is reported. If a facility has not been in existence during such a 12-month period, the determination is made on the basis of the available experience of the manufacturer. See also paragraph (c)(3) of this section, relating to imposition of tax where a retail outlet is maintained as an adjunct to a production facility or distribution center.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Delivery</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A manufacturer of tires or inner tubes may, at its option, treat either of the following events as constituting delivery to a retail outlet:</P>
                <P>(i) Delivery of tires or inner tubes to a common carrier (or, where the tires or tubes are transported by the manufacturer, the placing of the tires or tubes into the manufacturer's over-the-road vehicle) for shipment from the plant in which the tires or tubes are manufactured, or from a regional distribution center of tires and inner tubes, to a retail outlet or to a location in the immediate vicinity of a retail outlet primarily for future delivery to the retail outlet.</P>
                <P>(ii) Arrival of the tires or tubes at the retail outlet, or, where shipment is to a location in the immediate vicinity of a retail outlet primarily for future delivery to the retail outlet, the arrival of the tires or tubes at such location.</P>
                <FP>In its excise tax return for the first return period beginning after September 30, 1966, a manufacturer of tires or inner tubes must elect to determine the date of delivery to retail outlets in accordance with one of the two subdivisions of this paragraph (c)(1) and must determine the dates of all deliveries made to all retail outlets in accordance with the subdivision which the manufacturer has elected to apply. The election may be made in a statement attached to the return for such period. Having elected to treat one of the events listed in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (c)(1) as constituting delivery to a retail outlet for purposes of its return for the first return period after September 30, 1966, the manufacturer may not use a different criterion for a subsequent return period unless permission of the district director is obtained in advance.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Deliveries made in the immediate vicinity of a retail outlet primarily for future delivery to the retail outlet.</E> (i) For purposes of this section, any delivery which is made in the immediate vicinity of a retail outlet primarily for future delivery to the retail outlet is deemed to be a delivery to the retail outlet. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, a location is considered to be in the immediate vicinity of a retail outlet if the distance between the location and the retail outlet is sufficiently small so that it is feasible to transport tires and inner tubes between the location and the retail outlet by means of dollies, fork lift trucks, pushcarts, and similar vehicles of the type normally used around the premises of factories and similar establishments, as opposed to highway motor vehicles. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, it is immaterial that a public thoroughfare must be used in order to transport tires or inner tubes to a retail outlet from another location. Tires and inner tubes delivered to a location in the immediate vicinity of <PRTPAGE P="120"/>a retail outlet are considered to be delivered to the location “primarily for future delivery” to the retail outlet if it is determined that a majority (by number) of the tires and tubes removed from the location are delivered to the retail outlet. The determination described in the preceding sentence is made on the basis of the experience of a representative period of at least 12 consecutive calendar months during the 2-year period immediately preceding the first day included in the return period for which tax under section 4071(b) is reported. If a facility has not been in existence during such a 12-month period, the determination is made on the basis of the available experience of the manufacturer. If it is determined that the majority of all tires and inner tubes removed from a given location are delivered to a retail outlet of the manufacturer in the immediate vicinity of the location, tax is imposed upon all tires and tubes delivered by the manufacturer to the location, even though all or part of the tires or tubes comprising a particular shipment to the location may be intended for further transportation to a location other than the retail outlet. If it is determined that a majority of all tires and inner tubes removed from a given location are not delivered to a retail outlet of the manufacturer in the immediate vicinity of the location, tax is imposed upon the removal of a tire or inner tube from the location to the premises of the retail outlet. See also paragraph (d)(2) of this section, relating to sales by the manufacturer at facilities other than retail outlets.</P>

                <P>(ii) The provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples.

                  <P>A manufacturer of tires and tubes whose plant is located in City X operates two facilities in City Y; Warehouse A and Store Q. Store Q is a retail outlet within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, and Warehouse A is in the immediate vicinity of Store Q. During the 12-month period ending September 30, 1966, 60 percent of the tires and inner tubes removed from Warehouse A were delivered to Store Q. All tires or inner tubes delivered by the manufacturer to Warehouse A are subject to a tax under section 4071(b) and this section (unless, before such delivery, tax was imposed on the same tires and tubes).</P>

                <P>(3) <E T="03">Retail outlet maintained as adjunct of production or distribution facility.</E> If a retail outlet is maintained as an adjunct to and in the immediate vicinity of a facility which is not a retail outlet (as, for example, a production plant or a regional distribution center), delivery to the retail outlet is deemed to occur at the earlier of:</P>
                <P>(i) The date when a tire or inner tube is removed from the general storage facilities in the facility which is not a retail outlet for transfer to the premises of the retail outlet, or</P>
                <P>(ii) The date when a tire or inner tube is designated to be sold by or at the retail outlet.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Retail outlets which also sell at wholesale.</E> Tax applies to all shipments of tires and inner tubes delivered to a retail outlet as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Thus, for the purposes of section 4071(b) and this section, it is immaterial that all or part of the tires or inner tubes of a particular delivery to a retail outlet are intended for sale at wholesale. See also paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Sales by manufacturer at facilities other than retail outlets.</E> Sales by the manufacturer of tires and inner tubes at facilities other than retail outlets are subject to tax under section 4071(a).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Deliveries of tires or tubes on which tax has been previously imposed.</E> (i) Tax is not imposed under section 4071(b) and this section on any tire or inner tube in respect of which there was previously imposed a tax under section 4071(a). Similarly, a tire or inner tube is taxed only once under section 4071(b) and this section.</P>

                  <P>A manufacturer has two selling facilities, Store No. 1 and Store No. 2. Only retail sales are made at Store No. 2, which obtains its merchandise from Store No. 1. Assume that, although wholesaling and distribution activities are conducted at Store No. 1, the sale of tires and tubes at retail is conducted at Store No. 1 to the extent that Store No. 1 is a retail outlet within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, with the result that tax is imposed on deliveries by the manufacturer of tires and tubes <PRTPAGE P="121"/>to Store No. 1. Tax is not imposed on a delivery of tires or inner tubes from Store No. 1 to Store No. 2.</P>

                <P>The tax imposed by section 4071(a) applies with respect to tires and inner tubes (other than bicycle tires and inner tubes) that are original equipment for an imported article upon which no tax is imposed under section 4061 if the article is sold on or after December 11, 1971. In such a case, the importer of the article is treated as the manufacturer and vendor of the tires and inner tubes with which the article is equipped. However, the tax imposed by section 4071(a) is not imposed with respect to tires and inner tubes if the imported article is an automobile bus chassis or an automobile bus body. Solely for purposes of this section, the provisions of section 4218 (relating to use by a manufacturer or importer considered a sale) do not apply in cases where an individual imports an article having original equipment tires and tubes and on which article no tax is imposed under section 4061 if the article is imported solely for the individual's personal use and is so used.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>For purposes of the regulations in this part, unless otherwise expressly indicated:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Rubber.</E> The term “rubber” includes synthetic and substitute rubber.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Tread rubber.</E> The term “tread rubber” means any material (1) which is commonly or commercially known as tread rubber or camelback, or (2) which is a substitute for any material commonly or commercially known as tread rubber or camelback and is of a type used in recapping or retreading tires. The term includes, for example, strips of material, wholly or partially of rubber, natural or synthetic, intended to be vulcanized or otherwise affixed to a tire casing to form the outside perimeter of the tire, smooth or treaded. It also includes treading material produced by reprocessing scrap, salvage, or junk rubber and a continuous rubber ribbon produced through an extrusion process for direct application in recapping or retreading a tire casing. The term does not include rubber in various forms such as strip, slab, pellet, etc. which is used as raw material for the extrusion process. Tread rubber loses its identity as such when it has been used in the recapping or retreading of a tire of a type used on a highway vehicle (without regard to the actual use ultimately made of the tire) or has deteriorated in quality to the point where it is no longer suitable for use in recapping or retreading of a tire. (In the case of such deterioration, see section 6416(b)(2) and § 48.6416(b)-2 to secure a refund or credit of the tax paid.)</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Tires of the type used on highway vehicles.</E> (1) The term “tires of the type used on highway vehicles”, for purposes of §§ 48.4071-1 through 48.4073-3 means tires of the type used on:</P>
                <P>(i) Motor vehicles that are highway vehicles (within the meaning of § 48.4061(a)-1(d)), or</P>
                <P>(ii) Vehicles of the type used in connection with motor vehicles that are highway vehicles (within the meaning of § 48.4061(a)-1(d)).</P>
                <FP>The term “tires of the type used on highway vehicles” does not include bicycle tires. Bicycle tires, however, are included in the term “other tires” as used in section 4071(a)(2).</FP>
                <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, tires of the type used on motor vehicles that are highway vehicles include tires used on motor trucks, buses, passenger automobiles, motor homes, highway tractors, trolley buses or coaches, and motorcycles.</P>

                <P>(3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, tires of the type used on vehicles of the type used in connection with motor vehicles that are highway vehicles include tires used on truck or bus trailers, truck semitrailers, mobile homes, housetrailers, or utility trailers.<PRTPAGE P="122"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Inner tubes.</E> The term “inner tubes” includes air containers of all types made wholly or in part of rubber and designed and manufactured for use in pneumatic tires.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Tires.</E> The term “tires” includes rubber casings, hoops, and strips or bands of all kinds designed and shaped or built to form the tread of or to fit a vehicle wheel. Tires of either the pneumatic or solid type which fit or form the tread for wheels of any article which is capable of use as a means of transporting a person or burden are taxable as tires. Examples of articles which may be equipped with taxable tires are motor scooters, minibikes, industrial trucks, farm tractors, wheelbarrows, and similar articles. See section 4073(a) and § 48.4073-1 with respect to the exemption of tires of certain sizes, and section 4073(b) and § 48.4073-2 with respect to the exemption for tires with internal wire fastening.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Laminated tires.</E> For purposes of the tax imposed by section 4071, the term “laminated tires” means tires (1) which are not “tires of the type used on highway vehicles” within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, and (2) which consist wholly of scrap rubber from used tire casings with an internal metal fastening agent.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Manufacturer.</E> The term “manufacturer” means manufacturer, producer, or importer. A person who converts, by any process, a new tire taxable under section 4071 at one rate of tax into a tire taxable under section 4071 at a different rate (as for example, an off highway-type tire converted into a highway-type tire) is considered to be a manufacturer of the converted tire. If a conversion results in a reduced rate of tax for the converted tire, see section 6416(b)(2) and § 48.6416(b)-2 to secure a credit or refund of part of the tax paid. The term “manufactured” includes “produced” and “imported”.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Sold direct by manufacturer for nontaxable use.</E> The tax does not apply to the sale of tread rubber by the manufacturer to any person for use by that person otherwise than in the recapping or retreading of tires of the type used on highway vehicles. In determining whether tread rubber is sold for a taxable or nontaxable use, the type of vehicle on which the recapped or retreaded tire is to be used, or the actual or intended use of the recapped or retreaded tire, is immaterial. The controlling factor is whether the tire resulting from the recapping or retreading is of a type that is used otherwise <PRTPAGE P="123"/>than on a highway vehicle. For definition of “tires of the type used on highway vehicles”, see paragraph (c) of § 48.4072-1.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales for resale for nontaxable use.</E> No sale of tread rubber may be made tax free for resale even though it is known at the time of the sale that the tread rubber will be resold for use otherwise than in the recapping or retreading of tires of the type used on highway vehicles. However, where the tread rubber is resold for such use, the manufacturer who paid the tax on a sale of the tread rubber may secure a refund or credit in accordance with the provisions of section 6416(b)(2) and § 48.6416(b)-2.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Evidence required to establish exemption.</E> (1) To establish the right to sell tread rubber tax free under section 4073(c), the manufacturer must obtain from the purchaser and retain in its possession a properly executed exemption certificate.</P>
                <P>(2) Where only occasional sales of tread rubber for exempt use are made to a purchaser, a separate exemption certificate should be furnished for each order. However, where sales are regularly and frequently made to a purchaser for exempt use, a certificate covering all purchases during the period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters is acceptable. The certificates and proper records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be kept for inspection by the district director as provided in section 6001 and the regulations in subpart Q.</P>

The undersigned also understands that the fraudulent use of this certificate for the purpose of securing this exemption will subject the undersigned or any other party making such fraudulent use to a fine of not more than $10,000, or to imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, together with costs of prosecution.

TO and PH are taxable fuel registrants. When the fuel is removed from the terminal at the rack, the fuel is not dyed and marked in accordance with § 48.4082-1, and TO does not provide any person with any paperwork indicating that the fuel is dyed and marked. After the removal from the terminal, PH sells the fuel to individuals for use as heating oil, a nontaxable use.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Because PH is the position holder of the fuel at the time of the removal from the terminal, PH is liable for the tax imposed by section 4081.

                  <P>PH owns one million gallons of untaxed gasoline that is stored in TO's terminal. PH also is the position holder with respect to the gasoline.

PH continues to hold the inventory position on TO's records with respect to the one million gallons.

W sells to R 1,000 gallons of an untaxed liquid (a liquid described in § 48.4081-1(c)(1)(i)(B)) and delivers the liquid into a storage tank (tank) at R's retail facility. However, W's invoice to R states that the liquid is undyed diesel fuel. At the time of the delivery, the tank contains 4,000 gallons of undyed diesel fuel, a taxable fuel that has been taxed under section 4081. The resulting 5,000 gallon mixture is suitable for use as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle because it has practical and commercial fitness for use in the propulsion engine of a diesel-powered highway vehicle. The mixture does not satisfy the dyeing requirements of § 48.4082-1. R sells the mixture from the tank to a construction company for off-highway business use.</P>

Even though the <PRTPAGE P="131"/>blended taxable fuel is sold for off-highway business use, which is a nontaxable use as defined in section 4082(b), the sale is not exempt from tax because the blended taxable fuel does not satisfy the dyeing requirements of § 48.4082-1. Tax is computed on 1,000 gallons, which is the difference between the number of gallons of blended taxable fuel R sells (5,000) and the number of gallons of previously taxed taxable fuel used to produce the blended taxable fuel (4,000).</P>

W then goes to another location where X, the operator of a chemical plant, sells W 1,000 gallons of an untaxed liquid (a liquid described in § 48.4081-1(c)(1)(i)(B)). However, X's invoice to W states that the liquid is undyed diesel fuel. This liquid is delivered into the tank trailer already containing the 7,000 gallons of diesel fuel. The resulting 8,000 gallon mixture is suitable for use as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle because it has practical and commercial fitness for use in the propulsion engine of a diesel-powered highway vehicle. The mixture does not satisfy the dyeing requirements of § 48.4082-1. W sells the mixture to R, a retailer of petroleum products, and delivers the mixture into a storage tank at R's retail facility.

                <SUBJECT>Gasoline; gasohol.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This section provides rules for determining the applicability of reduced rates of tax on a removal or entry of gasohol or of gasoline used to produce gasohol. Rules are also provided for the imposition of tax on the separation of gasoline from gasohol and the failure to use gasoline that has been taxed at a reduced rate to produce gasohol.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Explanation of terms</E>—(1) <E T="03">Alcohol</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general; source of the alcohol.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, alcohol means any alcohol that is not a derivative product of petroleum, natural gas, or coal (including peat). Thus, the term includes methanol and ethanol that are not derived from petroleum, natural gas, or coal (including peat). The term also includes alcohol produced either within or outside the United States.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Proof and denaturants.</E> Alcohol does not include alcohol with a proof of less than 190 degrees (determined without regard to added denaturants). If the alcohol added to a fuel/alcohol mixture (the added alcohol) includes impurities or denaturants, the volume of alcohol in the mixture is determined under the following rules:</P>
                <P>(A) The volume of alcohol in the mixture includes the volume of any impurities (other than added denaturants and any fuel with which the alcohol is mixed) that reduce the purity of the added alcohol to not less than 190 proof (determined without regard to added denaturants).</P>
                <P>(B) The volume of alcohol in the mixture includes the volume of any approved denaturants that reduce the purity of the added alcohol, but only to the extent that the volume of the approved denaturants does not exceed five percent of the volume of the added alcohol (including the approved denaturants). If the volume of the approved denaturants exceeds five percent of the volume of the added alcohol, the excess over five percent is considered part of the nonalcohol content of the mixture.</P>
                <P>(C) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), approved denaturants are any denaturants (including gasoline and nonalcohol fuel denaturants) that reduce the purity of the added alcohol and are added to such alcohol under a formula approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Products derived from alcohol.</E> If alcohol described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section has been chemically transformed in producing another product (that is, the alcohol is no longer present as a separate chemical in the other product) and there is no significant loss in the energy content of the alcohol, any mixture containing the product includes the volume of alcohol used to produce the product. Thus, for example, a mixture of gasoline and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), or of gasoline and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), includes any alcohol described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section that is used to produce the ETBE or MTBE, respectively, in a chemical reaction in which there is no significant loss in the energy content of the alcohol.<PRTPAGE P="135"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Gasohol</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general</E>—(A) Gasohol is a mixture of gasoline and alcohol that is 10 percent gasohol, 7.7 percent gasohol, or 5.7 percent gasohol. The determination of whether a particular mixture is 10 percent gasohol, 7.7 percent gasohol, or 5.7 percent gasohol is made on a batch-by-batch basis. A batch of gasohol is a discrete mixture of gasoline and alcohol.</P>
                <P>(B) If a particular mixture is produced within the bulk transfer/terminal system (for example, at a refinery), the determination of whether the mixture is gasohol is made at the time of the taxable removal or entry of the mixture.</P>
                <P>(C) If a particular mixture is produced outside of the bulk transfer/terminal system (for example, by splash blending after the gasoline has been removed from the terminal at the rack), the determination of whether the mixture is gasohol is made immediately after the mixture is produced. In such a case, the contents of the batch typically correspond to a gasoline meter delivery ticket and an alcohol meter delivery ticket, each of which shows the number of gallons of liquid delivered into the mixture. The volume of each component in a batch (without adjustment for temperature) ordinarily is determined by the number of metered gallons shown on the delivery tickets for the gasoline and alcohol delivered. However, if metered gallons of gasoline and alcohol are added to a tank already containing more than a minor amount of liquid, the determination of whether a batch satisfies the alcohol-content requirement will be made by taking into account the amount of alcohol and non-alcohol fuel contained in the liquid already in the tank. Ordinarily, any amount in excess of 0.5 percent of the capacity of the tank will not be considered minor.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">10 percent gasohol</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> A batch of gasoline/alcohol mixture is 10 percent gasohol if it contains at least 9.8 percent alcohol by volume, without rounding.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Batches containing less than 10 percent but at least 9.8 percent alcohol.</E> If a batch of mixture contains less than 10 percent alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol, without rounding, only a portion of the batch is considered to be 10 percent gasohol. That portion equals the number of gallons of alcohol in the batch multiplied by 10. Any remaining liquid in the mixture is excess liquid.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">7.7 percent gasohol</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> A batch of gasoline/alcohol mixture is 7.7 percent gasohol if it contains less than 9.8 percent alcohol but at least 7.55 percent alcohol by volume, without rounding.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Batches containing less than 7.7 percent but at least 7.55 percent alcohol.</E> If a batch of mixture contains less than 7.7 percent alcohol but at least 7.55 percent alcohol, without rounding, only a portion of the batch is considered to be 7.7 percent gasohol. That portion equals the number of gallons of alcohol in the batch multiplied by 12.987. Any remaining liquid in the mixture is excess liquid.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">5.7 percent gasohol</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> A batch of gasoline/alcohol mixture is 5.7 percent gasohol if it contains less than 7.55 percent alcohol but at least 5.59 percent alcohol by volume, without rounding.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Batches containing less than 5.7 percent but at least 5.59 percent alcohol.</E> If a batch of mixture contains less than 5.7 percent alcohol but at least 5.59 percent alcohol, without rounding, only a portion of the batch is considered to be 5.7 percent gasohol. That portion equals the number of gallons of alcohol in the batch multiplied by 17.544. Any remaining liquid in the mixture is excess liquid.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Tax on excess liquid.</E> If tax was imposed on the excess liquid in any gasohol at the gasohol production tax rate (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section), the excess liquid in the batch is considered to be gasoline with respect to which there is a failure to blend into gasohol for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section. If tax was imposed on the excess liquid at the rate of tax described in section 4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is not allowed with respect to the excess liquid.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(2). In these examples, a gasohol blender creates a gasoline/alcohol mixture by pumping a specified amount of gasoline into an empty tank and then adding a specified amount of alcohol.

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <PRTPAGE P="136"/>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>Mixtures containing exactly 10 percent alcohol. The applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture is made with 7200 metered gallons of gasoline and 800 metered gallons of alcohol. Accordingly, the mixture contains 10 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the blender) and qualifies as 10 percent gasohol.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>Mixtures containing less than 10 percent alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. The applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture is made with 7205 metered gallons of gasoline and 795 metered gallons of alcohol. Because the mixture contains less than 10 percent alcohol, but more than 9.8 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the blender), 7950 gallons of the mixture qualify as 10 percent gasohol. If tax was imposed on the gasoline in the mixture at the gasohol production rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol, the remaining 50 gallons of the mixture (the excess liquid) are treated as gasoline with respect to which there was a failure to blend into gasohol for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section. If tax was imposed on the gasoline in the mixture at the rate of tax described in section 4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is allowed only with respect to 7155 gallons of gasoline.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
                  <P>Mixtures containing less than 5.59 percent alcohol. The applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture is made with 7568 metered gallons of gasoline and 436 metered gallons of alcohol. Because the mixture contains only 5.45 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the blender), the mixture does not qualify as gasohol.</P>

                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Example.</E> The following example illustrates this paragraph (f)(2):
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>(i) A registered gasohol blender bought gasoline in connection with a removal described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Based on the blender's certification (described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) that the blender would produce 10 percent gasohol with the gasoline, tax at the gasohol production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol was imposed on the removal.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The blender then produced a mixture by splash blending in a tank holding approximately 8000 gallons of mixture. The applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture was blended by first pumping 7220 metered gallons of gasoline into the empty tank, and then pumping 780 metered gallons of alcohol into the tank. Because the mixture contains 9.75 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the blender) the entire mixture qualifies as 7.7 percent gasohol, rather than 10 percent gasohol.</P>

                  <P>(iii) Because the 7220 gallons of gasoline were taxed at the gasohol production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol but the gasoline was blended into 7.7 percent gasohol, a failure to blend has occurred with respect to the gasoline. As the person that bought the gasoline in connection with the taxable removal, the blender is liable for the tax imposed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The amount of tax imposed is the difference between—
                  </P>

                  <P>(A) 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate applicable to 7.7 percent gasohol; and
                  </P>

                  <P>(B) 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol.
                  </P>
                  <P>(iv) Because the gasohol does not contain exactly 7.7 percent alcohol, the benefit of the gasohol production tax rate with respect to the alcohol is less than the amount of the alcohol mixture credit under section 40(b) (determined before the application of section 40(c)). Accordingly, the blender may be entitled to claim an alcohol mixture credit for the alcohol used in the gasohol. Under section 40(c), however, the amount of the alcohol mixture credit must be reduced to take into account the benefit provided with respect to the alcohol by the gasohol production tax rate.</P>

                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                  <P>(i) A is a taxable fuel registrant that owns 10,000 gallons of gasoline, and on April 5, 1996, is transporting the gasoline by barge on a waterway in the United States. That day, A sells the gasoline to B, a person that is not a taxable fuel registrant. A is liable for tax on the sale under § 48.4081-3(f). A pays this tax to the government and attaches to its return of the gasoline tax for the 2nd quarter of 1996 the first taxpayer's report described in paragraph (c) of this section. A also gives a copy of this report to B.</P>
                  <P>(ii) On April 9, 1996, B sells the gasoline to C, a taxable fuel registrant. B also gives C a copy of the first taxpayer's report and the statement of subsequent seller (required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section). On April 14, 1996, the gasoline is removed from a terminal at the rack. C is the position holder of the gasoline at the time of the removal and thus is liable for tax on the removal under § 48.4081-2(c)(1). C pays this tax to the government.</P>
                  <P>(iii) After C has filed a return of the second tax and before the end of the period prescribed by section 6511 for filing a claim for a refund, C files a claim for a refund of the second tax. The claim is in the form prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. C includes with its claim a copy of the first taxpayer's report and statement of subsequent seller. Because the conditions to allowance of a refund under paragraph (b) of this section have been met, C is allowed a refund of the second tax.</P>
                </EXAMPLE>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                  <P>The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 1</E> except that A does not pay the tax to the government. Because the first tax was not paid to the government as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the conditions to allowance of a refund under paragraph (b) of this section have not been met. Therefore, C is not allowed a refund of the second tax.</P>

                <P>(6) <E T="03">Sales and entries.</E> For purposes of determining whether tax is imposed by section 4081 on a sale or entry of diesel fuel or kerosene, such fuel satisfies the dyeing requirements of this paragraph (d) only if the dye required by § 48.4082-1(b) is combined with the fuel before the sale or entry and the seller or enterer has in its records evidence (such as a certificate from the terminal operator providing the fuel) establishing that the dye was combined with the fuel by means of a mechanical injection system. Thus, for example, diesel fuel or kerosene that is entered into the United States by means of nonbulk transfer (such as a railroad car) does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d) if the required dye and marker are combined with diesel fuel or kerosene after the diesel fuel or kerosene has been entered into the United States.</P>

The surety will be relieved of any liability that the bonded registrant incurs after the date named in the notice. However, the surety remains liable for the amount of tax that the bonded registrant incurred under sections 4041(a)(1) and 4081 during the term of the bond and for penalties and interest with respect to that tax.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Imposition and rate of tax on coal.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Imposition of tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4121(a) imposes a tax on coal mined at any time in this country if the coal is sold or used by the producer after March 31, 1978 (see section 4218 and the regulations under that section for rules relating to the use of coal being treated as a sale of coal). For purposes of this section, the term “producer” means the person in whom is vested ownership of the coal under state law immediately after the coal is severed from the ground, without regard to the existence of any contractual arrangement for the sale or other disposition of the coal or the payment of any royalties between the producer and third parties. The term includes any person who extracts coal from coal waste refuse piles or from the silt waste product which results from the wet washing (or similarly processing) of coal. However, the excise tax does not apply to a producer who sells the silt waste product without extracting the coal from it, or to the producer who uses the silt waste product without extracting the coal from it. Furthermore, the excise tax does not apply to the sale or use of the silt waste product after any coal has been extracted from it.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> Paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
                <P>A, a limited partnership, is the owner of land on which a coal mine is located. A contracts with XYZ Company to extract the coal for a set price per ton. XYZ Company is an independent contractor and has no ownership interest in the coal mined. Under state law, A is the owner of the coal immediately after severance. After XYZ extracts the coal from the mine, A sells the coal. A is the producer of the coal and is responsible for the payment of the excise tax.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>
                <P>A, a limited partnership, is the owner of land on which a coal mine is located. A leases the land to XYZ Company, and XYZ Company extracts coal from the mine and sells it. Under state law, XYZ is the owner of the coal immediately after the coal is severed from the ground. XYZ Company is the producer and must pay the excise tax. This is true even though the lease agreement requires XYZ to pay a royalty to A.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (3).</HD>
                <P>XYZ Company purchases a coal waste refuse pile from B and extracts the coal from the waste refuse pile and sells the coal. XYZ is the producer and must pay the excise tax.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (4).</HD>
                <P>XYZ Company is a producer of coal and operates its own cleaning plant. After wet washing the coal, it sells the coal and the silt waste product. The sale of the coal is subject to the excise tax whereas the sale of the silt is not.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (5).</HD>
                <P>Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that before selling the silt waste product XYZ Company extracts a small quantity of finely sized coal from the silt waste product and then sells both the finely sized coal and the silt waste product. The sale of the finely sized coal is subject to the excise tax whereas the sale of the silt is not.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate of tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">Underground mines; surface mines.</E> The rate of tax imposed on coal from underground mines located in the United States is the lower of 50 cents per ton (2,000 pounds), or 2 percent of the sale price. The rate of tax imposed on coal from surface mines located in the United States is the lower of 25 cents per ton (2,000 pounds) or 2 percent of the sale price. If a sale or use includes a portion of a ton, the tax is applied proportionately. Thus, if <PRTPAGE P="157"/>1,200 pounds of coal from an underground mine are sold for $35.00, the tax is 30 cents.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Combination.</E> If a single mine yields coal from both surface and underground mining, the producer must determine the rate (50 cents or 25 cents per ton) for each ton of coal mined: It is presumed that coal is mined from underground mines (50 cents per ton) unless the producer keeps sufficient records to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the coal was mined from a surface mine.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Lignite or imported coal.</E> The excise tax of coal does not apply to lignite or imported coal. Lignite is defined in accordance with the standard specification for classification of coals by rank of the American Society for Testing and Materials (Annual Book of ASTM Standards Part 26, D 388). The procedures specified in D 388 must be followed. If a producer extracts both taxable coal and lignite, then the producer must maintain adequate records to establish the portion of the mineral mined that is exempt from the tax. In determining whether all or a portion of the mineral extracted is lignite, the Service will consider all the facts and circumstances. For example, if a producer sells lignite and coal, the Service will examine all the facts and circumstances, including the contract price, contract specifications, and the amount of lignite extracted as it compares to the amount of lignite sold.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other exemptions not applicable.</E> There are no exemptions for sales for further manufacture, for export, for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, for the use of a State or local government, or for the use of a nonprofit educational organization. Furthermore, the Secretary does not have discretion to exempt sales of coal for use of the United States from the tax. There is also no exemption from the coal excise tax when the coal is used in further manufacture of another article that is subject to manufacturers excise tax. For example, if a producer of coal converts coal into gasoline which the producer then sells, the producer is liable for the coal excise tax when the coal is converted into gasoline and also liable for the manufacturers excise tax on gasoline when the gasoline is sold.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Definitions and special rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Coal produced from surface mine.</E> Coal is treated as produced from a surface mine if all of the geological matter (e.g., trees, earth, rock) above the coal is removed before the coal is mined. In addition, both coal mined by auger and coal that is reclaimed from coal waste refuse piles are treated as produced from a surface mine.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Coal produced from underground mine.</E> Coal is treated as produced from an underground mine if it is not produced from a surface mine.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Coal used by the producer.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “coal used by the producer” means use by the producer in other than a mining process. A mining process is determined the same way it is determined for percentage depletion purposes. For example, a producer who mines coal does not “use” the coal and thereby becomes liable for the tax merely because, before selling the coal, the producer breaks it, cleans it, sizes it, or applies one of the other processes listed in section 613(c)(4)(A) of the Code. In such a case, the producer will be liable for the tax only when he sells the coal. On the other hand, a producer who mines coal does become liable for the tax when he uses the coal as fuel, as an ingredient in making coke, or in another process not treated as “mining” under section 613(c).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Tonnage sold and sales price.</E> For purposes of determining both the amount of coal sold by a producer and the sales price of the coal, the point of sale is f.o.b. mine, or f.o.b. cleaning point if the producer cleans the coal before selling it. This is true even if the producer sells the coal on the basis of a delivered price. Accordingly, f.o.b. mine or cleaning point is the point at which the number of tons sold is to be determined for purposes of applying the applicable tonnage rate, and the point at which the sales price is to be determined for purposes of the tax under the 2 percent rate.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Constructive sale price.</E> If a producer uses coal mined by the producer in other than a mining process, a constructive sale price must be used in determining the tax under the 2 percent <PRTPAGE P="158"/>rate. This constructive price is determined under sections 613(c) and 4218(e) of the Code, and is based on sales of like kind and grade of coal by the producer or other producers made f.o.b. mine (if the coal is used without first being cleaned) or f.o.b. cleaning plant (if the coal is cleaned before it is used). Normally, this constructive price will be the same as the constructive price used in determining the producer's percentage depletion deduction.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Imposition of tax.</E> Section 4161(a) imposes a tax on the sale of the following articles of fishing equipment (including in each case parts or accessories of such articles sold on or in connection therewith or with the sale thereof) by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof:</P>
              <P>(1) Fishing rods;</P>
              <P>(2) Fishing creels;</P>
              <P>(3) Fishing reels; and</P>
              <P>(4) Artificial lures, baits, and flies.</P>
              <FP>The tax applies only to those items of fishing equipment specified in section 4161(a) and this paragraph. Therefore, other items of fishing equipment, such as fishing nets, lines, hooks, sinkers, gaffs, etc., are not subject to the tax. Furthermore, the tax applies only to those specified articles of fishing equipment that are designed or constructed for use in the sport of fishing. Accordingly, the tax does not apply to those articles which, although nominally articles that are specified in section 4161(a), are in the nature of toys or novelties that merely simulate articles of a type referred to in section 4161(a), and are not designed or constructed for practical use in the sport of fishing.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate of tax.</E> Tax is imposed on the sale of the articles enumerated in section 4161(a) and paragraph (a) of this section at the rate of 10 percent of the price for which such articles are sold. For the definition of the term “price” see section 4216 and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Liability for tax.</E> The tax imposed by section 4161(a) is payable by the manufacturer, producer, or importer making the sale. For determining who is the manufacturer, producer, or importer, see § 48.0-2(a)(4).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Meaning of terms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Fishing rods.</E> The term “fishing rods” includes all articles, however, designated, that are designed or constructed for use in conjunction with a fishing reel for casting a line and hook in the sport of fishing. The term does not include any article that is neither designed for use in casting, nor suitable for such use. A so-called fishing rod “blank” is not considered to be a “fishing rod” unless the blank contains an affixed handle and reel seat, or is sold in the form of a kit that contains a rod blank, a handle, and a reel seat.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fishing creels.</E> The term “fishing creels” includes all portable containers, of whatever material made, that are designed for storing and carrying fish from the time they are caught until such time as they are removed from the container for consumption or preservation. The term does not include any article primarily designed for use in the commercial fishing industry, or an article such as a collapsible wire basket designed to be hung over the side of a boat to keep fish captive and alive in the water.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fishing reels.</E> The term “fishing reels” includes all mechanical and electrical devices that contain a spool for dispensing and recovering fishing line, and are designed for use with fishing rods in casting and in reeling in hooked fish in the sport of fishing. The term also includes reels designed for use with bows, in the sport of bowfishing.<PRTPAGE P="159"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Artificial lures, baits, and flies.</E> The term “artificial lures, baits, and flies” includes all artifacts, of whatever materials made, that simulate an article considered edible by fish and are designed to be attached to a line or hook to attract fish so that they may be captured. Thus, the term includes such artifacts as imitation flies, blades, spoons, and spinners, and edible materials that have been processed so as to resemble a different edible article considered more attractive to fish, such as bread crumbs treated so as to simulate salmon eggs, and pork rind cut and dyed to resemble frogs, eels, or tadpoles.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Parts and accessories.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax attaches with respect to parts and accessories for articles specified in section 4161(a) and § 48.4161(a)-1 that are sold on or in connection with such articles, or with the sale thereof, at the same rate applicable to the sale of the basic articles. The tax attaches in such cases whether or not charges for the parts or accessories are billed separately. To be considered a part or accessory for an article specified in section 4161(a), an item must be either essential to the operation of the specified article, or be designed to directly improve the performance of the specified article, or to improve its appearance. For example, a carrying case for a fishing rod is not considered to be a part or accessory for a fishing rod, despite the fact that it is designed for use with the rod, because it is neither essential to the use of the rod, nor does it in any way improve its performance or appearance. A sale of a part or accessory which would otherwise be considered a sale “on or in connection with” the sale of an article taxable under section 4161(a), is not subject to tax if the part or accessory is sold as a replacement for an identical part or accessory being sold with the taxable article.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Essential equipment.</E> If taxable articles are sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, without parts or accessories that are essential for their operation, or are designed directly to improve the performance or appearnace of the articles, the separate sale of the parts accessories to the same vendee will be considered, in the absense of evidence to the contrary, to have been made in connection with the sale of the basic article, even though the parts or accessories are shipped separately at the same time or on a different date.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Meaning of terms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of the tax imposed by section 4161(b), and unless otherwise expressly indicated:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Bows.</E> The term “bows” includes all articles made of flexible materials, that are designed to be equipped with a string and used for the propelling of arrows in the sport of archery (target shooting), or in hunting or fishing.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Arrows.</E> The term “arrows” includes all articles designed or constructed to be propelled by a bow in the sport of archery (target shooting), or in hunting or fishing. The overall length of an arrow is to be measured from the point of the tip or arrow-head to the end of the arrow nock. In the case of arrows sold by the manufacturer without heads, tips, or nocks, the overall length is to include the length of the shaft plus the length of the nock and head or tip that is normally used with the particular type of arrow shaft.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Parts and accessories</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> “Parts and accessories” for bows and arrows include all articles (other than fishing reels) suitable for inclusion in, or attachment to, a bow or arrow of the type described in section 4161(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section. Examples of parts and accessories for bows are bow handles, bow limbs, bow strings, bow string silencers, bow stabilizers, arrow rests, bow slings, bow sights, bow levels, bow tip protectors, brush buttons, camouflaged bow covers, and all other articles designed to be attached to or included in a bow to assist in aiming or propelling an arrow, or to protect the bow while in use. Example of parts and accessories for arrows are arrow shafts, nocks, tips, heads, head adapters, and feathers.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">General purpose materials and articles.</E> General purpose materials and articles that are not specifically designed to directly improve the performance or appearance of bows or arrows, or to protect them while in use, are not considered to be “parts and accessories” for bows or arrows, even though such materials may be intended, after further processing, to be included in or attached to bows or arrows. An example of a nontaxable article that is designed for use with a bow, but is neither attached to a bow, nor serves a purpose directly related to the efficient use of a bow, is a carrying case for a bow. Examples of nontaxable general purpose materials or articles are glues and cements, feathers before they are prepared for use with arrows, and bowstring thread before it is processed into bowstrings. Arrow-shaft material is considered to be a taxable part for an arrow, unless the manufacturer, producer, or importer can establish that the particular material is unsuitable for use in the manufacture of arrows that are subject to the tax imposed by section 4161(b)(1)(B). In addition, the term “parts and accessories” does not include articles in the nature of expendable supplies, even though such articles are designed to be applied to, or used with, bows or arrows. Examples of such supply materials are bowstring wax, and archery powder.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Quivers.</E> The term “quivers” includes all articles, of whatever material made, that are designed to contain, and to provide ready access to, taxable arrows during the time an archer is engaged in target shooting, hunting, or fishing. The term does not include any article designed solely for storing or transporting arrows during times when the arrows are not in use.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Taxable medical device.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Taxable medical device</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A taxable medical device is any device, as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), that is intended for humans. For purposes of this section, a device defined in section 201(h) of the FFDCA that is intended for humans means a device that is listed as a device with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under section 510(j) of the FFDCA and 21 CFR part 807, pursuant to FDA requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Devices that should have been listed with the FDA.</E> If a device is not listed as a device with the FDA but the FDA determines that the device should have been listed as a device, the device will be deemed to be listed as a device with the FDA as of the date the FDA notifies the manufacturer or importer in writing that corrective action with respect to listing is required.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Specific exemptions.</E> The term <E T="03">taxable medical device</E> does not include eyeglasses, contact lenses, and hearing aids.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Retail exemption.</E> The term <E T="03">taxable medical device</E> does not include any device of a type that is generally purchased by the general public at retail <PRTPAGE P="162"/>for individual use (the retail exemption). A device will be considered to be of a type that is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use if it is regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers who are not medical professionals, and if the design of the device demonstrates that it is not primarily intended for use in a medical institution or office or by a medical professional. Whether a device is of a type described in the preceding sentence is evaluated based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Factors relevant to this evaluation are enumerated in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Further, there may be facts and circumstances that are relevant in evaluating whether a device is of a type generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use in addition to those described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The determination of whether a device is of a type that qualifies for the retail exemption is made based on the overall balance of factors relevant to the particular type of device. The fact that a device is of a type that requires a prescription is not a factor in the determination of whether or not the device falls under the retail exemption.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers.</E> The following factors are relevant in determining whether a device is of a type that is regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers who are not medical professionals:</P>
              <P>(A) Whether consumers who are not medical professionals can purchase the device in person, over the telephone, or over the Internet, through retail businesses such as drug stores, supermarkets, or medical supply stores and retailers that primarily sell devices (for example, specialty medical stores, durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) suppliers and similar vendors);</P>
              <P>(B) Whether consumers who are not medical professionals can use the device safely and effectively for its intended medical purpose with minimal or no training from a medical professional; and</P>
              <P>(C) Whether the device is classified by the FDA under Subpart D of 21 CFR part 890 (Physical Medicine Devices).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Primarily for use in a medical institution or office or by a medical professional.</E> The following factors are relevant in determining whether a device is designed primarily for use in a medical institution or office or by a medical professional:</P>
              <P>(A) Whether the device generally must be implanted, inserted, operated, or otherwise administered by a medical professional;</P>
              <P>(B) Whether the cost to acquire, maintain, and/or use the device requires a large initial investment and/or ongoing expenditure that is not affordable for the average individual consumer;</P>
              <P>(C) Whether the device is a Class III device under the FDA system of classification;</P>
              <P>(D) Whether the device is classified by the FDA under—</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>X manufactures non-sterile absorbent tipped applicators. X sells the applicators to distributors Y and Z, which, in turn, sell the applicators to medical institutions and offices, medical professionals, and retail businesses. The FDA requires manufacturers of non-sterile absorbent tipped applicators to list the applicators as a device with the FDA. The applicators are classified by the FDA under 21 CFR part 880 (General Hospital and Personal Use Devices) and product code KXF.</P>
                <P>Absorbent tipped applicators do not fall within a retail exemption safe harbor set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Therefore, the determination of whether the absorbent tipped applicators are devices of a type generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use must be made on a facts and circumstances basis.</P>
                <P>Individual consumers who are not medical professionals can regularly purchase the absorbent tipped applicators at drug stores, supermarkets, cosmetic supply stores or other similar businesses, and can use the applicators safely and effectively for their intended medical purpose without training from a medical professional. Further, the absorbent tipped applicators do not need to be implanted, inserted, operated, or otherwise administered by a medical professional, do not require a large investment and/or ongoing expenditure, are not a Class III device, are not classified by the FDA under a category described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, and are not “items requiring frequent and substantial servicing” as defined in 42 CFR 414.222.</P>
                <P>Thus, the applicators have multiple factors under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that tend to show they are regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers and none of the factors under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section tend to show they are designed primarily for use in a medical institution or office or by medical professionals. Based on the totality of the facts and circumstances, the applicators are devices that are of a type that are generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use.</P>

It is immaterial for this purpose that the charge may be paid to a person other than the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or that it may be separately billed to the purchaser as a charge earmarked for expenses incurred or to be incurred in his behalf, such as charges for demonstration or display of the article, for sales promotion programs, or otherwise. With respect to the rules relating to exclusion (in the case of sales after December 31, 1960) of charges for local advertising of a manufacturer's products, see section 4216(e) and § 48.4216(e)-1. In the case of sales on credit, a carrying, finance, or service charge is excludable from the sale price if it is reasonably related to the costs of carrying the deferred portion of the sale price (such as interest on the deferred portion of the sale price, expenses of bookkeeping necessary to keep the records of such sales, and expenses of correspondence and other communication in connection with collection).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tools and dies.</E> Separate charges for tools and dies used in the manufacture or production of a taxable article are to be included, in whole or in part, in the sale price on which the tax is based. It is immaterial whether the charges for such items are billed in a lump sum or are amortized or allocated to each of the taxable articles. If, at the termination of a contract to manufacture taxable articles, the tools and dies used in production pass to the purchaser, only the amount of depreciation of the tools and dies incurred in production, computed on a “production output” basis, should be included in the sale price. If the purchaser furnishes the tools and dies, the amount of the cost thereof, to the extent that such cost has been depreciated in the production of the taxable articles (computed on a “production output” basis), shall be included in determining the sale price of the articles for purposes of computing the tax. This paragraph applies to sales by manufacturers after May 5, 1974.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Charges for warranty.</E> A charge for a warranty of an article which the manufacturer, producer, or importer requires the purchaser to pay in order to obtain the article shall be included in the sale price of the article on which the tax is computed. On the other hand, a charge for a warranty of a taxable article paid at the purchaser's option shall not be included in the sale price for purposes of computing tax thereon.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Charges for coverings, containers, and packing.</E> Any charge by the manufacturer, producer, or importer for coverings and containers of whatever nature used to pack an article for shipment shall be included as part of the sale price for the purpose of computing the tax, whether or not the charges are identified as such on the invoice or are billed separately. Even though there is an agreement that the manufacturer, producer, or importer will repay all or a portion of the charge for the coverings or containers upon the return thereof, the full charge nevertheless shall be included in the sale price. It is immaterial whether the charge made at the time of sale is more or less than the actual value of the covering or container. See paragraph (b)(4) of § 48.6416(b)-1 for provisions relating to the claiming of a credit or refund in the case of a price readjustment due to the return or repossession of a covering or container. Packing charges are to be included in the sale price whether the charges cover normal packing or special packing services, such as for extra protection of the article or for odd-lot quantities. This rule shall apply whether the packing services are initiated by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or are furnished at the request of the purchaser and whether the packing is performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or by another person at his request. If the purchaser supplies packing materials, the fair market value of such materials must be included in the tax base when computing tax liability on the sale of the article.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Taxable and nontaxable articles sold as a unit.</E> Where a taxable article and a nontaxable article are sold by the manufacturer as a unit, the tax attaches to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the taxable article. For example, where a fishing reel (an article subject to tax under section 4161(a)) is equipped with a fishing line (a nontaxable article) and the reel and line <PRTPAGE P="170"/>are sold as a unit, the tax imposed by section 4161(a) applies only to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the fishing reel. Normally, the taxable portion of such a unit may be determined by applying to the manufacturer's sale price of the unit the ratio which the manufacturer's separate sale price of the taxable article bears to the sum of the sale prices of both the taxable and nontaxable articles, if such articles are sold separately by the manufacturer. Where the articles (or either one of them) are not sold separately by the manufacturer and do not have established sale prices, the taxable portion is to be determined from a comparison of the actual costs of the articles to the manufacturer. Thus, if the cost of the taxable article represents four-fifths of the total cost of the complete unit, the tax applies to four-fifths of the price charged by the manufacturer for the unit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exclusions from sale price.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tax not part of taxable sale price.</E> The tax imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of an article is not part of the taxable sale price of the article. Thus, if a manufacturer computes the tax on a sale price which is determined without regard to the tax, and it charges the proper tax as a separate item, the amount of tax so charged does not become a part of the taxable sale price and no tax is due on the tax so charged. Where no separate charge is made as tax, it will be presumed that the price charged to the purchaser for the article includes the proper tax, and the proper percentage of such price will be allocated to the tax.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computation of tax.</E> If an article subject to tax at the rate of 10 percent is sold for $100 and an additional item of $10 is billed as tax, $100 is the taxable selling price and $10 is the amount of tax due thereon. However, if the article is sold for $100 with no separate billing or indication of the amount of the tax, it will be presumed that the tax is included in the $100, and a computation will be necessary to determine what portion of the total amount represents the sale price of the article and what portion represents the tax. The computation is as follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>Taxable sale price = sale price including tax/100 + rate of tax.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <FP>Thus, if the tax rate is 10 percent and the sale price including tax is $100, the taxable sale price is $90.91 (that is, $100 divided by (100 + 10)), and the tax is 10 percent of $90.91, or $9.09.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Transportation, delivery, insurance, or installation charges</E>—(1) <E T="03">Charges incurred pursuant to sale.</E> Charges for transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and other expenses actually incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale shall be excluded from the sale price in computing the tax. Such charges include all items of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and similar expense incurred after shipment to a customer begins, in response to the customer's order, pursuant to a bona fide sale. However, costs of such nature incurred by a manufacturer, producer, or importer in transporting, in the normal course of business and for its benefit and convenience, articles from a factory or port of entry to a warehouse or other facility (regardless of the location of such warehouse or facility) are not considered as being incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona find sale, and charges therefor cannot be excluded from the sale price in computing tax liability. Similarly, an allowance granted by a manufacturer as reimbursement for expenses incurred by the purchaser in shipping used articles to the manufacturer for credit against the purchase price of taxable articles shall not be excluded from the sale price when computing tax due on the sale of the taxable articles. In any event, no charge may be excluded from the sale price unless the conditions set forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are complied with. Said conditions are prescribed under the authority granted the Secretary or his delegate in section 4216(a).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Only actual expenses to be excluded.</E> Where a separate charge is made for transportation or other expenses incurred in connection with the delivery <PRTPAGE P="171"/>of an article to the purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale, there shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price subject to tax only that portion of the charge which represents the actual expenses incurred for the transportation or other excludible expenses. Where a separate charge is less than the actual expense, the difference is presumed to be included in the billed price. Such difference, together with the separate charge, shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price on which the tax is computed. Similarly, where no separate charge is made but the manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs an expense of the type to which this paragraph has application, the amount of such expense actually incurred shall be excluded from the sale price on which the tax is computed. Where transportation expense is incurred in conjunction with a shipment composed of both taxable and nontaxable articles, only the portion of the expense allocable to the taxable articles shall be excludible. In general, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that another method reasonably apportions such freight expense between taxable and nontaxable articles, such expense should be apportioned on the basis of the relative weights (or, if available, the relative published tariff rates applicable to) the taxable and nontaxable articles. Where it is not feasible to apportion such expense on the basis of relative weights or tariff rates, the expense shall be apportioned on another reasonable basis; for example, in the case of a shipment including both taxable and nontaxable automotive parts which are subject to the same tariff rate, it may be appropriate to apportion the transportation expense on the basis of the relative sale prices. A charge for insurance in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser is considered to represent an expense actually incurred only to the extent that an amount equivalent to such charge is paid or payable by the manufacturer to a person authorized to assume such insurance risk.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Transportation, delivery, or installation services performed by manufacturer.</E> For purposes of computing the taxable sale price of articles, it is immaterial whether the transportation, delivery, or other services of the type to which this paragraph has application are performed by a common carrier or independent agency for or on behalf of the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or are performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the use of its own vehicles or other facilities. Thus, where a manufacturer, producer, or importer performs the transportation, delivery, or other services with its equipment, tools, employees, etc., the cost of such services allocable to the sale of the taxable article shall be excluded. In determining whether an expense is an excludible transportation or delivery expense, only those expenses incurred by reason of the fact that the purchaser accepts delivery at some point other than the manufacturer's place of business shall be considered excludible transportation or delivery expenses. All expenses incurred in placing an article packed, ready for shipment on the loading dock at the manufacturer's factory are not excludible transportation or delivery expenses. An allowance granted by the manufacturer, producer, or importer to the purchaser for transportation, delivery, or other expenses incurred or to be incurred by the purchaser in connection with the sale shall be excluded in computing the taxable sale price, if charges for similar expenses would be excludible if incurred by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Records in support of exclusion.</E> Every manufacturer, producer, or importer making sales of taxable articles shall keep records which will disclose the amount of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation or other expense actually incurred by it in connection with the delivery of a taxable article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> A charge or expense not within the scope of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, whether or not separately stated, may not be excluded in computing the taxable sale price unless it can be shown by adequate records that the charge or expense properly is not to be included as a manufacturing or selling expense or is in no way incidental to placing the article in condition packed ready for shipment. <PRTPAGE P="172"/>Commissions to manufacturers' agents, or allowances, payments, or adjustments made to, and for the benefit of, persons other than the purchaser may not be excluded or deducted, under any condition, in computing the sale price upon which the tax is computed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Other items relating to tax on sale price.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Exchanges.</E> If, in connection with the sale of an article subject to a tax imposed under Chapter 32 on the price for which sold, a manufacturer receives from its vendee another article in exchange, the tax on the manufacturer's sale shall be computed on the basis of the amount allowed for the article received from the vendee, plus any additional amount charged the vendee.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Replacements under warranty.</E> If an article, subject to a tax imposed under Chapter 32 on the price for which sold, is returned to the manufacturer by reason of the failure of the article under a warranty as to its quality or service, and a new article is given by the manufacturer, free, or at a reduced price, the tax on the new article shall be computed on the actual amount, if any, to be paid to the manufacturer for the new article. See paragraph (b)(2) of § 48.6416(b)-1 for the circumstances under which the allowance made by the manufacturer, producer, or importer upon the return of the first article constitutes a price readjustment of the sale price of first article and the extent, if any, to which a credit may be allowed, or refund made, of the tax paid by the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of the first article.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Readjustments in sale price.</E> Readjustment in sale price (such as allowable discounts, rebates, bonuses, etc.) cannot be anticipated. The tax must be based upon the original price unless the readjustments have actually been made prior to the close of the period for which the tax upon the sale is returned. However, if the price upon which the tax was computed is subsequently readjusted, credit may be taken against the tax due on a subsequent return or a claim for refund filed as provided by section 6416(b)(1) and the regulations thereunder.</P>

              <P>(2) Section 4216(b)(2) applies generally to arm's-length sales of an article at retail or to retailers, or both, where the manufacturer also sells the same article to wholesale distributors.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 4216(b)(3) provides a formula for determining a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between members of an affiliated group of corporations (as “affiliated group” is defined in section 1504(a)) in those instances where the purchasing corporation regularly resells to retailers but does not regularly resell to wholesale distributors, and except for situations where section 4216(b) (4) or (5) applies.</P>
              <P>(4) Section 4216(b)(4) provides a special method for computing a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between affiliated corporations where the purchasing corporation sells only to retailers, and the normal method of selling within the industry is for manufacturers to sell to wholesale distributors.</P>

              <P>(5) Section 4216(b)(5) provides a special method for computing a constructive sale price for sales of articles subject to a tax imposed by section 4061(a) (trucks, buses, tractors, etc.) between affiliated corporations, where the purchasing corporation regularly sells such articles in arm's-length transactions to independent retailers.<PRTPAGE P="173"/>

              <SUBJECT>Constructive sale price; basic rules.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4216(b)(1) sets forth the conditions that require the Secretary to construct a sale price on which to compute a tax imposed under Chapter 32 on the price for which an article is sold. The section requires a constructive sale price to be established where a taxable article is (1) sold at retail, (2) sold while on consignment, or (3) sold otherwise than through an arm's-length transaction at less than fair market price. See § 48.4216 (b)-2 (c) for the treatment of articles taxable under section 4061(a).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales at retail.</E> Section 4216(b)(1)(A) relates to the determination of a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles sold at arm's length and at retail. In the case of such sales, the constructive sale price is the highest price for which such articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. If the constructive sale price is less than the actual sale price, the constructive sale price shall be used as the tax base. If the constructive sale price is not less than the actual sale price, the actual sale price shall be considered as not less than fair market, and shall be used as the tax base. In determining the highest price for which articles are sold by manufacturers to wholesale distributors, there must be taken into consideration the normal industry practices with respect to section 4216 (a) and (f) inclusions and exclusions. However, once a constructive sale price has been determined by the Secretary or his delegate, no further adjustment of such price shall be made. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) and this paragraph shall not apply in those instances where the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) and § 48.4216(b)-3 apply.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sales of articles taxable under section 4061(a).</E> With respect to sales made after December 31, 1978, in the case of an article the sale of which is taxable under section 4061(a) and which is sold at retail, the tax under this chapter shall be computed on a percentage (as determined by the Secretary but not greater than 100 percent) of the actual selling price based on the highest price for which such articles are sold by manufacturers and producers in the ordinary course of trade. The constructive sale price under this section shall be determined without regard to any individual manufacturer's or producer's cost.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Sales on consignment.</E> As in the case of sales at retail, the constructive sale price for sales on consignment shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary or his delegate. For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(B) and this paragraph, an article is considered to be sold on consignment if it is sold while it is on consignment to a person which has the right to sell, and does sell, such article in its own name, but never receives title to the article from the manufacturer. Ordinarily, the constructive sale price of an article sold on consignment is the net price received by the manufacturer from the consignee. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(B) and this paragraph shall not apply if the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) and § 48.4216(b)-3 apply.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Sales not at arm's length.</E> For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(C) and this paragraph, a sale is considered to be <PRTPAGE P="174"/>made under circumstances otherwise than at “arm's length” if:</P>
              <P>(1) One of the parties is controlled (in law or in fact) by the other, or there is common control, whether or not such control is actually exercised to influence the sale price, or</P>
              <P>(2) The sale is made pursuant to special arrangements between a manufacturer and a purchaser.</P>
              <FP>In the case of an article sold otherwise than at arm's length, and at less than fair market price, the constructive sale price shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. Once such a constructive sale price has been determined, no further adjustment of such price shall be made. See sections 4216(b) (3), (4), and (5), and § 48.4216 (b)-4, for specific methods for determining constructive sale prices for intercompany sales under certain defined conditions.</FP>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4216 (b)(2) provides a special rule under which a manufacturer shall determine a constructive sale price for his sales of taxable articles at retail, and to retail dealers, under certain conditions. The rule is applicable where:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer regularly sells such articles at retail, or to retailers, or both, as the case may be,</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer also regularly sells such articles to one or more wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions, and the manufacturer establishes that its prices in such cases are determined without regard to any benefit to be derived under section 4216(b)(2),</P>
              <P>(3) The transactions are arm's-length transactions, and</P>
              <P>(4) With respect to articles to which the tax imposed by section 4061(a) applies (relating to trucks, buses, tractors, etc.), the normal method of sales for such articles within the industry is not to sell such articles at retail or to retailers, or combinations thereof.</P>
              <FP>A manufacturer meeting the foregoing requirements shall base its tax liability for sales at retail and sales to retailers on the lower of its actual sale price or the highest price for which it sells the same articles under the same conditions to wholesale distributors.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of section 4216(b)(2) and this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Actual sale price.</E> “Actual sale price” means the actual selling price of an article determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale. Accordingly, such price must reflect the inclusions and exclusions set forth in sections 4216 (a) and (f), and any price adjustments described in section 6416(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Highest price to wholesale distributors.</E> The “highest price” charged wholesale distributors for an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, is the highest price at which the manufacturer, producer, or importer sells the article to wholesale distributors, determined without regard to quantity. Such price shall be determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale with respect to sections 4216 (a) and (f) inclusions and exclusions; however, since the price is to be a “highest” price, no further adjustment may be made for price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Regular sales.</E> An article is considered to sold “regularly” at retail or to retailers if sales are made at retail or to retailers periodically and recurringly as a regular part of the seller's business. If a seller makes only isolated or casual sales of an article at retail or to retailers, it is not considered to be selling “regularly” at retail or to retailers. Similarly, a manufacturer is considered to be making regular sales for an article to one or more distributors if it sells the article to at least one distributor periodically and recurringly as a regular part of its business.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Normal method of sales in industry.</E> In the absence of a showing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of a more appropriate manner of determining the normal method of sales within an industry which is practical in application, the normal method of sales within an industry shall be regarded as not being at retail or to retailers, or both, if the industry dollar <PRTPAGE P="175"/>volume of sales which are at retail or to retailers, or both, is less than half the total industry dollar volume of sales at all levels of distribution by manufacturers, producers, or importers, including sales to other manufacturers, producers, or importers.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Industry.</E> Each of the following categories of articles upon which tax is imposed by section 4061(a) constitutes a separate “industry”:</P>
              <P>(i) Taxable automobile trucks (consisting of automobile truck bodies and chassis);</P>
              <P>(ii) Taxable automobile buses (consisting of automobile bus bodies and chassis);</P>
              <P>(iii) Taxable truck and bus trailers and semitrailers (consisting of chassis and bodies of such trailers and semi-trailers); and</P>

              <P>(6) <E T="03">Application of section 4216(b)(2) to certain sales before June 22, 1965.</E> In the case of sales before June 22, 1965, of articles then taxable under section 4121 (relating to electric, gas, and oil appliances), section 4216(b)(2) also applied in the case of a sale of such an article to a special dealer. The applicability of section 4216(b)(2) to such a sale may be determined by inserting “or to a special dealer” following “or to a retailer” in so much of section 4216(b)(2) as precedes subparagraph (A); by inserting “or to special dealers” following “retailers” in section 4216(b)(2)(A); and by inserting “(other than special dealers)” after “wholesale distributors” in section 4216(b)(2)(B) and so much of section 4216(b)(2) as follows section 4216(b)(2)(D). A “special dealer” was a distributor of articles taxable under section 4121 who did not maintain a sales force to resell the article whose constructive sale price was established under section 4216(b)(2) but relied on salesmen of the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the article. In the case of sales before June 22, 1965, of articles taxable under section 4191 (relating to business machines) or section 4211 (relating to matches), section 4216(b)(2) was applicable in the same manner as in the case of articles taxable under section 4061(a). With respect to sales after September 30, 1972, section 4216(b)(2)(C) applied only to articles taxable under section 4061(a), 4191, or 4211. Section 4216(b)(2)(C) was applicable to sales before October 1, 1962, of all articles subject to tax under Chapter 32.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Computation of tax on leases and installment sales.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Leases.</E> When a taxable article is leased by a manufacturer, producer, or importer, liability for tax is incurred, except as provided by section 4217(b) and § 48.4217-2, on each payment made with respect to such lease. Tax is payable on each lease payment as long as the article is leased by the manufacturer, producer, or importer. The tax payable with respect to each lease payment is a percentage of each payment based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the lease payment is due. If the article is subsequently sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, the tax applies also to such sale, without regard to the tax paid when the article was leased. For definition of the term “lease”, see paragraph (a) of § 48.4217-1(a).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Installment sales.</E> When a taxable article is sold under an installment payment contract with title reserved in the seller, or under a conditional sale contract, chattel mortgage arrangement or other arrangement creating a security interest with payments to be made in installments, tax shall be computed and paid on each payment made by the purchaser. The tax payable with each payment is a percentage of each payment based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the payment is due. The part of each payment that is subject to tax is that portion of the payment equal to the percentage of the total charge for the article that is subject to tax. For example, if the total charge for the article is $1,000, and of the total amount charged only 90 percent thereof, or $900, is subject to tax by reason of exclusions, then only 90 percent of the installment payment is subject to tax. If the tax base is a constructive sale price computed under section 4216(b) that is less than the actual sale price of the article, the portion of each payment subject to tax is the percentage of such payment equal to the percentage that the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price. For example, if an article is sold at retail for $100, and the constructive sale price for such an article computed under the provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) is $75, the percentage which the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price is 75 percent. Accordingly, only 75 percent of each installment payment is subject to tax.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sales on credit.</E> Where articles are sold on credit under conditions other than those specified in paragraph (b) of <PRTPAGE P="178"/>this section, the entire tax shall be reported and paid with the return covering the period in which the sale is made, even though the price may not be paid to the manufacturer, producer, or importer until a later date, or not paid at all.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Effective dates of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</E> The rules set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are effective as of June 22, 1965. As in effect before June 22, 1965, section 4216(c) required, in the case of a transaction described in section 4216(c) (1), (2), (3), or (4), that there be paid upon each payment with respect to an article that portion of the total tax which was proportionate to the portion of the total amount to be paid represented by such payment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Contracts for the lease, installment sale, or sale on credit, of a taxable medical device</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Payments made on or after January 1, 2013, pursuant to a contract for the lease, installment sale, or sale on credit of a taxable medical device that was entered into on or after March 30, 2010, are subject to tax under section 4191. The provisions of sections 4216(c) and 4217, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, and § 48.4217-2 apply.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception for payments made on or after January 1, 2013, pursuant to written binding contracts entered into prior to March 30, 2010.</E> Payments made on or after January 1, 2013, pursuant to a written binding contract for the lease, installment sale, or sale on credit of a taxable medical device that was in effect prior to March 30, 2010, are not subject to tax under section 4191. This exception includes payments made on or after January 1, 2013, if they are made pursuant to a written binding contract that was entered into prior to March 30, 2010. This exception does not apply to payments made under any contract that is materially modified on or after March 30, 2010. For this purpose, a material modification includes only a modification that materially affects the property to be provided under the contract, the terms of payment under the contract, or the amount payable under the contract.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4216(e) deals with the treatment to be accorded charges made by a manufacturer for, and reimbursements by a manufacturer of expenditures in connection with, the advertising of certain articles subject to excise tax under chapter 32 of the Code. Section 4216(e) provides an exclusion (which is in addition to the exclusions provided by section 4216(a) and the regulations thereunder) in respect of charges for local advertising, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of determining the price for which an article is sold. See paragraph (c) of this section. The exclusion provided by section 4216(e) and paragraph (c) of this section has application only if:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of articles sold during the period January 1, 1961, through December 31, 1962, the advertising is broadcast over a radio or television station, or appears in a newspaper; and</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of articles sold on or after January 1, 1963, the advertising is broadcast over a radio or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.</P>
              <FP>Section 4216(e) also provides an overall limitation in respect of the sum of the amount of the exclusions from price as charges for local advertising and the amount of the readjustments authorized under section 6416(b)(1) (relating to credits or refunds for price readjustments) in respect of reimbursements by a manufacture of expenditures for local advertising. See § 48.4216(e)-2. For provisions prohibiting exclusion from price or readjustment of price in respect of charges for, and reimbursements of expenditures for, advertising other than local advertising, see § 48.4216(e)-3.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of local advertising</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of the regulations under sections 4216(e) and 6416(b)(1), the term “local advertising” means advertising which relates to an article with respect to which tax is imposed under Chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold and which:</P>
              <P>(i) Is initiated or obtained by the purchaser or any subsequent vendee,</P>

              <P>(ii) Names the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 and states the location at which such article may be purchased at retail, and<PRTPAGE P="180"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii)(<E T="03">a</E>) In the case of articles sold on or after January 1, 1961, and before January 1, 1963, is broadcast over a radio station or television station or appears in a newspaper, or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) In the case of articles sold on or after January 1, 1963, is broadcast over a radio station or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Initiating or obtaining advertising.</E> For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the advertising must be initiated or obtained by one or more of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article (wholesale distributor, jobber, dealer, etc.) who purchased the article for resale. For purposes of this subparagraph, the manufacturer is not considered to be one of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article. In general, advertising of an article is considered to be initiated or obtained by one or more persons in the chain of distribution of the article if any such person:</P>
              <P>(i) Takes an active part in the actual planning and development, or in the arrangements or negotiations leading to the development, of the form and content of the advertising, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Contracts for the placement of the advertising.</P>
              <FP>The participation by the manufacturer of the article in the planning, development, or placement of the advertising is immaterial provided the advertising is in fact initiated or obtained by one or more persons in the chain of distribution of the article. Furthermore, it is immaterial whether or not the advertising is subject to the approval of the manufacturer of the article. However, if no person in the chain of distribution of the article takes an active part in the actual planning and development, or in the arrangements or negotiations leading to the development, of the form and content of the advertising, but, rather, all such planning, development, arrangements, and negotiations are accomplished by the manufacturer of the article, then such manufacturer is considered to have initiated the advertising, and if he also contracts for the placement of the advertising, such advertising does not qualify as “local advertising”.</FP>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Identification of article and sales location.</E> To meet the requirements of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the advertising must identify the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 and give the location or locations at which the article may be purchased at retail. All products taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code shall be considered to be an “article” for purposes of the preceding sentence. No specific method or means of identification is prescribed. The identification of the article may be made through the use of the name of the manufacturer or the use of an established trade-mark, such as a seal, picture, letter or letters, etc., or a combination thereof. The advertising must identify the particular retail establishment or establishments at which the article may be purchased at retail but need not specify the location of any such establishment in terms of the number by which the premises are designated or the name of the street on which the retail premises are situated. However, the location of the retail premises must be described sufficiently, as, for example, by reference to a particular named shopping area or shopping center, to enable consumers to find the retail establishment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Determination of costs of local advertising.</E> Where an advertisement identifies more than one article, and all such articles are not taxable, or are not taxable at the same rate under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code, a reasonable allocation of the cost of the advertisement must be made among (i) articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code and (ii) articles which are not taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code. For example, in the case of a single page newspaper or magazine advertisement, an allocation of costs reflecting the lineage or space devoted to the specified categories will be considered to reflect a reasonable allocation of the cost of advertising the different articles. As a general rule, only the cost of the “spot” portion identifying the retail establishment is considered “local advertising” in the case of national television or radio programs.<PRTPAGE P="181"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Meaning of “newspaper”.</E> The term “newspaper”, as used in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, is limited to those publications which are commonly understood to be newspapers and which are printed and distributed periodically at daily, weekly, or other short intervals for the dissemination of news of a general character and of a general interest. The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers, or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. Neither does the term include any publication which is issued to supply information on certain subjects of interest to particular groups unless such publication otherwise qualifies as a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be news of a general character and of a general interest.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Meaning of “magazine”.</E> The term “magazine”, as used in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, is limited to those publications which are (i) commonly understood to be magazines, (ii) printed and distributed periodically at least twice a year, and (iii) published for the dissemination of information of a general nature or of special interest to particular groups. The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a magazine within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be information of a general nature or information of special interest to particular groups within the contemplation of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Meaning of “outdoor advertising sign or poster”.</E> The term “outdoor advertising sign or poster”, as used in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, means a sign or poster displaying advertising matter, which is located outside of a roofed enclosure. This term includes both signs or posters on billboards, whether placed on or affixed to land, buildings, or other structures, and those which are displayed on or attached to moving objects, provided the signs or posters are located outside of a roofed enclosure. The term “roofed enclosure” means a roof structure which is enclosed on more than one-half of its sides by walls, fences, or other barriers.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exclusion</E>—(1) <E T="03">Conditions and limitations.</E> A charge for local advertising which is required by a manufacturer to be paid as a condition to his sale of an article is not a part of the taxable price of the article, to the extent that such charge meets each of the following conditions and limitations:</P>

              <P>(i) Such charge does not exceed 5 percent of the difference between (<E T="03">a</E>) an amount which would constitute to taxable price of the article (computed at the time of the sale of the article) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price and (<E T="03">b</E>) the amount of any separate charge for local advertising, whatever the amount of such charge may be,</P>
              <P>(ii) Such charge is specifically shown as a separate charge for local advertising on the invoice or statement covering the sale of the article.</P>
              <P>(iii) Such charge is billed by the manufacturer with the intention on his part of repaying the amount of the charge to the person purchasing the article from him, or to any person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred or local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the fact of such intention will be assumed in all cases where the manufacturer and his vendees are parties to an advertising plan which calls for such repayments, or the manufacturer can otherwise establish that the vendees to whom he bills such charges understand and expect that such repayments will be made.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">When exclusion ceases to apply.</E> To the extent that charge for local advertising meets the conditions and limitations stated in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, such charge is excludable in computing the taxable price of the article in respect of which the charge was made. However, the exclusion will cease to apply in respect of any part of such charge which the manufacturer <PRTPAGE P="182"/>fails to repay, before May 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the article was sold, to the person who purchased the article from him, or to some other person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. If, before such May 1, any part of the charge so excluded has not been so repaid, the manufacturer becomes liable for tax on such May 1 in the same manner as if an article taxable under such section of the Code had been sold by him on such May 1 at a taxable price equivalent to that part of the charge not so repaid. However, see paragraph (c)(2) of § 48.6416(b)-1, relating to price readjustments in cases where local advertising charges are not repaid before such May 1 but are subsequently paid over by the manufacturer to his vendees in reimbursement of costs for local advertising. For provisions relating to the method of determining whether a payment by a manufacturer is or is not attributable to an excluded local advertising charge, see paragraph (b)(3) of § 48.4216(e)-2. In any case where the payment is determined to be attributable to such a charge, the date of the sale in connection with which the charge was made shall be determined on a first-in-first-out basis in respect of the vendee to whom the charge was billed by the manufacturer.</P>

Pursuant to such agreement, the selection of the advertising medium to be employed is to be made by the distributor, who is to plan the advertising subject to approval by the manufacturer, and contract for its placement. In this example, the advertising for which the charge is made qualifies as local advertising, the charge is billed to the manufacturer's vendee as a separate charge, the manufacturer intends to repay the charge to his vendee in reimbursement of costs incurred by the vendee for local advertising, and the charge does not exceed 5 percent of $10,000.

                <FP>At the time of the manufacturer's sales of the refrigerators, it was his intention, in accordance with the terms of a cooperative advertising plan to which the manufacturer and the distributor were parties, to make repayment to the distributor of the local advertising charge. Pursuant to the plan, the repayment would be made to the extent of <PRTPAGE P="183"/>expenditures by the distributor for radio, television, or newspaper advertising, initiated or obtained by him, specifically naming refrigerators or other articles taxable at the same rate under section 4111 which were manufactured by the manufacturer, and giving the location of various retail stores within the distributor's territory where such articles may be purchased. In this example, only $500 of the manufacturer's charge of $1,000 for local advertising may be excluded in determining the taxable price of the refrigerators for purposes of reporting and paying the tax imposed by section 4111. The remaining $500 may not be excluded in computing the taxable price of the refrigerators since this is the amount by which the $1,000 local advertising charge exceeds 5 percent of $10,000. Thus, the taxable price of the refrigerators in this example is $10,500.</FP>

              <SUBJECT>Limitation on aggregate of exclusions and price readjustments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The sum of the amount excluded from taxable price in respect of charges for local advertising, as provided in section 4216(e)(1) and § 48.4216(e)-1, plus the amount of the readjustments for which credits or refunds may be claimed in respect of local advertising, as provided in section 6416(b)(1) and paragraph (c) of § 48.6416(b)-1, is subject to an over-all 5 percent limitation. This limitation applies to each manufacturer, as of the close of each calendar quarter, in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 which were sold by such manufacturer in such quarter (and the preceding quarter of quarters, if any, in the calendar year). For example, a manufacturer selling articles taxable under section 4061 (relating to automobiles, trucks, buses, etc.), and also selling articles taxable under section 4111 (relating to refrigerators, quick-freeze units, etc.), who makes separate charges for local advertising in connection with his sales, or who makes reimbursement of local advertising expenses to his vendees out of moneys previously included in taxable price, in respect of any one or more articles in each of the two groups must apply the limitation separately in relation to the articles taxable under section 4061 and in relation to the articles taxable under section 4111. However, in such case, no breakdown of the separate articles taxable under section 4061, or of the separate articles taxable under section 4111, is required.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of over-all 5 percent limitation</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The limitation prescribed by section 4216(e)(2) (the “over-all 5 percent limitation” referred to in paragraph (a) of this section) as to the total of the exclusions from price and readjustments of price which may be claimed for local advertising in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code shall be computed as of the close of each calendar quarter of the calendar year. The over-all 5 percent limitation is 5 percent of the difference between (i) the amount which would constitute the total taxable price (computed at the time of sale) of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code sold by the manufacturer during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and (ii) the total of all amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising of such articles (whatever the amount of any single charge of the total of all charges). In making the computations under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, credits or refunds under section 6416(b) of tax paid on the sale of any such articles are to be disregarded and articles sold tax-free by the manufacturer are to be excluded. The amount by which the over-all 5 percent limitation computed as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under the same section of the Code exceeds the sum of the <PRTPAGE P="184"/>charges for local advertising excluded in computing the taxable price and the amount of reimbursements for local advertising of such articles made during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, in respect of which credit or refund has been claimed, represents the unused portion of the over-all 5 percent limitation. Such unused portion is the maximum amount of reimbursements for local advertising in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed at the close of the particular calendar quarter, subject to the applicable conditions and limitations governing the right to claim a credit or refund in respect of local advertising (see § 48.6416(b)-1). The unused portion of the over-all 5 percent limitation as of the close of the fourth calendar quarter of a calendar year in respect of which credit or refund may not be claimed as of the close of such quarter must be disregarded in computing the over-all 5 percent limitation for any subsequent calendar quarter. Moreover, the amount of any reimbursements for local advertising made by a manufacturer in a calendar year which is in excess of the amount of such reimbursements in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed, within the over-all limitation, as of the close of the calendar year, may not subsequently serve as the basis for a credit or refund.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Alternative method of computation in certain cases.</E> If during the portion of the calendar year ending with the date as of which the over-all 5 percent limitation is being computed the amount of the local advertising charge separately billed by the manufacturer has not, in respect of any sale of any articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code, exceeded the amount excludable pursuant to paragraph (c) of § 48.4216(e)-1 in computing taxable price, the over-all 5 percent limitation as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under such section is 5 percent of the total taxable price (computed at the time of the sale) of all such articles sold taxpaid during the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Allocation of amounts paid in reimbursement of expenditures for local advertising.</E> If a manufacturer makes contributions to a local advertising program in connection with which he makes excludable local advertising charges, it is necessary that reimbursements by the manufacturer for local advertising be attributed to the charges for local advertising, to the manufacturer's contributions, or allocated between them. Whether an amount paid by a manufacturer in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising is or is not a repayment of a local advertising charge which was excluded from taxable price under section 4216(e)(1) and § 48.4216(e)-1, shall be determined on the basis of an allocation made under the agreement between the manufacturer and his vendee (or any subsequent vendee).</P>

              <P>For purposes of Chapter 32 of the Code, the lease of an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer shall be considered a sale of the article. The term “lease” means a contract or agreement, written or verbal, which gives the lessee an exclusive, continuous right to the possession or use of a particular article for a period of time. The term includes any renewal or extension of a lease or any subsequent lease of the article. However, in the case of the lease of an automobile the sale of which by the manufacturer would be taxable under section 4064, the term includes only the first lease (excluding any renewal or extension of the lease) of such automobile by the manufacturer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limitation on amount of tax applicable to certain leases.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions for eligibility.</E> Section 4217(b) provides for a limitation on the amount of tax that shall apply to the lease, any renewal, or further lease, of an article which, if sold, would be subject to tax on the basis of sale price. Such limitation on the amount of the tax applies with respect to the lease of an article only if, at the time of making the lease, the lessor is engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of article. In case of a lease to which section 4217(b) does not apply, tax shall be computed and paid as provided in section 4216(c) and paragraph (a) of § 48.4216(c)-1.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Lessor engaged in business of selling.</E> The lessor will be regarded as being engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of an article as the one being leased if it periodically and recurringly makes bona fide offers for sale of such articles in the regular course of operation of its business, which offers if accepted would constitute sales at arm's length. Whether the offers are bona fide shall be determined on the basis of the facts in each case, such as sales actually made, the nature of the advertising, sales literature, and other means used to effectuate sales. It is not necessary that the offers for sale be made to the same class of purchasers as those to whom the article is being leased.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Same type and model of article.</E> To qualify as the “same type and model of article”, the article offered for sale must be an unused article essentially the same in size, design, and function as the article being leased. For example, a van-type truck trailer would not be the same type and model as a stake-body of flat-bed truck trailer. Neither would a 25-foot van-type trailer be the same type and model as a 35-foot van-type trailer. Slight differences in appearance or accessories will not render <PRTPAGE P="187"/>articles dissimilar which are identical in all other respects.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Basis for tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tax payable until total tax is paid.</E> In case of a lease of an article to which section 4217 (b) applies, tax shall be paid on each lease payment in an amount computed by applying to such lease payment a percentage equal to the rate of tax in effect on the date of the lease payment. Such tax payments shall continue to be made under such lease, or any subsequent lease of the article, until the cumulative total of the tax payments equals the total tax. Lease payments made thereafter with respect to that article shall not be subject to tax. For definition of the term “total tax”, see paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Changes in tax rates.</E> Except as provided in:</P>
              <P>(i) Section 701 (a) (3) of the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 155) in the case of certain reductions in tax rates effective June 22, 1965, or January 1, 1966, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Section 401(h)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1971 (85 Stat. 534) in the case of certain reductions in tax rates effective December 11, 1971, if the rate of tax is increased or decreased during a lease period, the new rate shall apply to the lease payments made on and after the date of the change, but the amount of the total tax shall remain the same.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Total tax.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “total tax” means the amount of tax, computed at the rate in effect on the date of the first lease of the article to which section 4217(b) applies, which would be due on the constructive sale price of the article as determined under section 4216(b) and § 48.4216(b)-2, as if the article had been sold by a manufacturer at retail on such date.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Sale of article before total tax becomes payable.</E> If the lessor sells the article before the total tax has become payable, the tax payable on the sale shall be the lesser of the following amounts:</P>
              <P>(1) The difference between (i) the total tax, and (ii) the aggregate tax applicable to lease payments already received; or</P>
              <P>(2) A tax computed, at the rate in effect on the date of the sale, on the price for which the article is sold.</P>
              <FP>For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the provisions of section 4216(b) for determining a constructive sale price shall not apply if the sale is at arm's length. If the sale is not at arm's length, the tax referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be computed on a constructive sale price as provided in § 48.4216(b)-2.</FP>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Sale of article after total tax has become payable.</E> If the lessor sells an article after the total tax has become payable, the tax imposed under Chapter 32 of the Code shall not apply to such sale.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Special rules applicable to certain leases entered into before January 1, 1959.</E> For purposes of this section, in the case of any lease entered into before, and existing on, January 1, 1959:</P>
              <P>(1) Such lease shall be considered to have been entered into on January 1, 1959.</P>
              <P>(2) The total tax shall be computed on the fair market value of the article on January 1, 1959.</P>
              <P>(3) The lease payments under such lease shall include only payents attributable to periods beginning after December 31, 1958.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Cross-reference.</E> In the case of the lease of an automobile the sale of which by the manufacturer would be taxable under section 4064, the foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply.

                <SUBJECT>Tax on use by manufacturer, producer, or importer.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4218 imposes tax in respect of certain uses of articles by the actual manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof. This section also applies in respect of the use of articles by any other person who, pursuant to a provision of Chapter 32 of the Code, is considered to be, or is treated as, the <PRTPAGE P="188"/>manufacturer or producer of the articles. See, for example, section 4223 relating to articles purchased tax free for use in further manufacture.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Taxable articles in general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application of tax.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code (other than an article referred to in paragraph (a), (d), or (e) of this section) uses the article for any purpose other than that indicated in subparagraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph, he shall be liable for tax with respect to the use of such article in the same manner as if the article were sold by him.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Taxable use in manufacture of nontaxable articles</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of an article to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies, tax attaches when the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the article uses it as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article which is not taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code, regardless of the disposition made of such other article. (See paragraph (c) of § 48.4218-5 for computation of tax on such use.)</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Types of use in manufacture of nontaxable articles.</E> Taxable use may consist of the incorporation of a taxable article, such as an electric light bulb, into a nontaxable article, such as a flashlight. Taxable use may also result from the combining of a taxable article (or the components thereof) with a nontaxable article (or the components of a nontaxable article) resulting in a combination end article which itself is not taxable. Although the taxable article may not be a completely separable unit, within the contemplation of the law a taxable article has been produced and incorporated in the combination end article. The following are examples of taxable articles so used:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Household type electric or gas clothes drier incorporated in a combination washer-drier.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Household type electric, gas, or oil cooking range combined either with a range using other means of heating or with a nontaxable space heater.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Taxable radio receiving set incorporated in a combination radio receiver-transmitter or in a combination radio receiver-intercommunication system.</P>
                <FP>If an automobile part or accessory, radio or television component, or camera lens is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a taxable article to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph has application and such article in turn is used in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a nontaxable article, the part or accessory, component, or lens is considered to have been used in the manufacture of the taxable article, and not in the manufacture of the nontaxable article. For example, the use of taxable radio components in the production of a taxable radio receiving set is exempt from tax (see paragraph (d) of this section), but the use of the radio receiving set in the production of a nontaxable combination radio receiver-transmitter is subject to tax. See section 6416(b)(2) or 6416(b)(3) and the regulations thereunder contained in subpart O for credit or refund of tax paid in respect of such radio receiver if the combination radio receiver-transmitter is by any person exported, sold to a State or local government for its exclusive use, sold to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use, or used or sold for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft.</FP>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Nontaxable use in manufacture of taxable articles.</E> The tax on the use of an article to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph has application shall not apply if the article is used by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article taxable under Chapter 32 to be manufactured or produced by him. It is immaterial what disposition is made of such other article.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Gasoline.</E> The tax on the use of an article shall not apply in the case of gasoline used on or after October 1, 1961, by any person, for nonfuel purposes, as a material in the manufacture or production of another article to be manufactured or produced by him. See section 4221 and the regulations thereunder contained in subpart N. For provisions applicable to use of gasoline by a producer or importer otherwise than in the production of other gasoline, or <PRTPAGE P="189"/>special motor fuel taxable under section 4041(b), see section 4082(c) and paragraph (c) of § 48.4082-1 contained in subpart H.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Tires, inner tubes, and automobile radio or television receiving sets.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of a tire or inner tube taxable under section 4071 (other than a bicycle tire or inner tube referred to in paragraph (e) of this section), or an automobile radio or television receiving set taxable under section 4141, sells such article on or in connection with the sale of any other article or uses it for any purpose, he shall be liable for tax with respect to such tire, inner tube, or radio or television receiving set in the same manner as if it were sold by him as a separate article. However, tax does not apply where the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the tire, inner tube, or automobile radio or television receiving set sells such article on or in connection with the sale of another article manufactured by him for any of the exempt purposes specified in paragraphs (2) to (5), inclusive, of section 4221(a) and the regulations thereunder contained in subpart N.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Automobile parts or accessories, radio or television components, and camera lenses</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application of tax.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an automobile part or accessory taxable under section 4061(b), a radio or television component taxable under section 4141, or a camera lens taxable under section 4171, uses the article for any purpose other than that indicated in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, he shall be liable for tax with respect to the use of the article in the same manner as if the article were sold by him. For example, tax applies if the manufacturer, producer, or importer uses the article referred to in this subparagraph for repair or replacement purposes in connection with equipment used by him in the operation of his business.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Nontaxable use in manufacture of other articles.</E> The tax on the use of an article referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply if the article is used by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, any other article (whether or not taxable under Chapter 32) to be manufactured or produced by him. It is immaterial what disposition is made of such other article.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Bicycle tires and inner tubes</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application of tax.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of a bicycle tire as defined in section 4221(e)(4)(B) or an inner tube for such a tire uses the tire or inner tube for any purpose other than as indicated in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, he shall be liable for tax with respect to the use of the tire or inner tube in the same manner as if the article were sold by him.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Nontaxable use in manufacture of other articles.</E> The tax on the use of a bicycle tire or inner tube referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply if the tire or inner tube is used by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a new bicycle to be manufactured or produced by him. It is immaterial what disposition is made of the new bicycle. Tax, however, applies in the case of the use of a bicycle tire or inner tube by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof in the rebuilding or reconditioning of a used bicycle.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the use on or after May 1, 1960, of a bicycle tire or inner tube by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof. Liability for tax on the use prior to that date of a bicycle tire or inner tube by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof shall be based on the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section which apply to tires and inner tubes in general.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Use after lease.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of a taxable article leases such article and thereafter uses the article, he incurs liability for tax on such use as provided in these regulations to the same extent as if the article were sold after being leased. See section 4217 and the regulations thereunder in this subpart for application and computation of tax in case of leased articles.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Time of application of tax.</E> In the case of a taxable use of an article by <PRTPAGE P="190"/>the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, the tax attaches at the time such use begins. If tax applies by reason of the sale of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof on or in connection with his sale of another article, the tax attaches at the time of the sale of such other article.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Exemptions because of other statutory provisions.</E> Tax does not apply on the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if under the applicable provisions of the Code the sale of the article for a similar use would not be subject to tax. For example, the use of gasoline by the producer thereof to propel tankers engaged in foreign trade which are owned or leased by the producer would not be subject to tax under section 4218 since a sale for such use would be exempt from tax as provided in section 4221(a)(3). Also, tax need not be paid with respect to the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if such use would qualify, under the provisions of section 6416(b), for credit or refund of the tax paid.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use in further manufacture.</SUBJECT>

                <P>For purposes of section 4218 and § 48.4218-1, an article is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article, if it is incorporated in, or is a part or accessory of, the other article. Lubricating oil in the crankcase of a new truck is an example of a taxable article use as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article. In addition, an article (other than gasoline used as a fuel) is considered to be used as material in the manufacture of another article if it is partly or entirely consumed in testing such other article; for example, shells or cartridges used in testing new firearms. similarly, if an article is partly or wholly consumed in quality testing a production run of like articles (as, for example, an automotive part destroyed in stress testing) such article is also considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of another article. However, if a taxable article that has been used tax free and only partly consumed in testing is later sold, or put to a taxable use, by the manufacturer, tax attaches to such sale or use. An article that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, such other article. Thus, lubricating oil consumed in operating plant machinery in the <PRTPAGE P="191"/>course of the manufacture of automobile truck chassis is not used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, the truck chassis.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Computation of tax.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Tax based on price.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, tax liability incurred on the use of an article shall be computed on the price at which such or similar articles are sold in the ordinary course of trade by manufacturers, producers, or importers thereof and in the absence of special arrangements. For additional provisions applicable in computing the tax in the case of the use of an article by a manufacturer and producer who purchased the article free of tax under section 4221(a)(1) for use by him in further manufacture, see section 423(b) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Articles regularly sold by manufacturer.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article regularly sells such articles at wholesale in arm's length transactions, tax liability on his use of any such article shall be computed on his lowest established wholesale price for such articles in effect at the time of the taxable use. In establishing such price, there shall be included and excluded, as applicable, the charges and readjustments specified in sections 4216(a), 4216(f), and 6416(b)(1), as in effect at the time tax liability on the use of the article is incurred, and the regulations thereunder contained in this subpart and subpart O. If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article does not regularly sell such articles at wholesale in arm's length transactions, a constructive price on which the use tax shall be computed will be determined by the Commissioner. This price will be established after considering the selling practices and price structures of manufacturers, producers, and importers of similar articles.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Articles governed by section 4218(a) used in manufacture of nontaxable combination articles.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article to which section 4218(a) applies does not regularly sell such article separately but uses it as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a nontaxable combination article consisting of a taxable and nontaxable article, liability for tax on his use shall be computed on the constructive price of the taxable article at the time of use. To determine the constructive price of the taxable article in such case, the combination article is considered to be composed of (1) parts used exclusively in the functioning of the taxable article in the combination, (2) parts used exclusively in the functioning of the nontaxable article in the combination, and (3) parts, called common parts, which serve a dual function in connection with the parts in both subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph. The ratio which the cost of the parts in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph bears to the sum of the cost of such parts and the parts in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is applied to the lowest established wholesale price for which like combination articles are at the time of the taxable use being sold by the manufacturer or producer in the ordinary course of trade. The resulting amount is the constructive sale price for the taxable article on which tax is to be computed. The cost of the common parts is allocable to the parts in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph in the same ratio, and, therefore, need not be taken into account in the computation since the inclusion and allocation of the cost of such parts in the determination would not result in a different ratio. In determining the lowest established wholesale price for the combination article, there shall be included and excluded, as applicable, the charges and readjustments specified in sections 4216(a), 4216(f), and 6416(b)(1), as in effect at the time tax liability on the use of the taxable article is incurred, and the regulations thereunder contained in this subpart and subpart O of this part. The tax applicable to the use of the article for which a constructive sale price has been computed is not affected by any charges or readjustments of the price for which the nontaxable combination article is sold, whether by reason of the <PRTPAGE P="192"/>return or repossession of the nontaxable article or its covering or container, or by a bona fide discount, rebate, allowance, or other factor. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:
                </P>
                <EXAMPLE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                  <P>A manufacturer of a nontaxable washer-drier combination produces and uses an electric clothes drier taxable under section 4121 in the manufacture of the combination article. The lowest established wholesale price of the manufacturer for the washer-drier combination at the time of the taxable use is $150 with respect to identical combinations after including and excluding applicable charges and readjustments. The manufacturer does not regularly sell such drier separately. In the manufacture of the washer-drier the two units are integrated to the extent that certain component parts function both in the operation of the washer and of the drier. The parts used exclusively in the operation of the washer cost $30 and those used exclusively in the operation of the drier cost $20. The taxable cost ratio in this instance is 20/50, or 40 percent. Applying 40 percent to the manufacturer's lowest established wholesale price of $150 for the washer-drier results in $60 as the constructive price for the taxable article in the combination at the time tax liability is incurred. No additional charges or readjustments in connection with, or subsequent to, the sale of the washer-drier combination may affect the tax liability incurred at the time of use.</P>

The following examples illustrate this rule:</P>
                <P>(1) The surviving spouse, child or children, executors or administrators, or other legal representatives, as the case may be, of a deceased manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incur liability for tax on all such articles sold by them.</P>
                <P>(2) A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy who under a court order conducts or liquidates the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by him, regardless of whether the articles were manufactured, produced, or imported before or after he took charge of the business.</P>
                <P>(3) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs liability for tax with respect to all taxable articles sold by him as such assignee.</P>
                <P>(4) If one or more members of a partnership withdraw, or if new partners are admitted, the new partnership so constituted incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by it regardless of when such articles were manufactured, produced, or imported.</P>
                <P>(5) A person who acquires title to taxable articles as a result of default of the manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to an agreement under the terms of which the articles were pledged as collateral incurs liability for tax with respect to his sale of the articles so acquired.</P>
                <P>(6) A person who succeeds to the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, such as:</P>
                <P>(i) A corporation which results from a consolidation, merger, or reorganization;</P>
                <P>(ii) A corporation which acquires the business of an individual or partnership; or</P>

                <FP>incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by such person. However, <PRTPAGE P="193"/>where a manufacturer, producer, or importer sells only his assets, rather than ownership of his business, he incurs liability for tax on the sale of any taxable articles included in such assets.</FP>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Transfer of title to damaged articles.</E> If title to a damaged taxable article is transferred by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof to a carrier or insurance company in adjustment of a damage claim, such transfer is not considered a taxable sale of the article. If the article is usable, even though damaged, the carrier or insurance company incurs liability for tax on its sale, lease, or use of the article. Where the article has been damaged to the extent that its only value is as scrap, and it is not restored to usable condition, sale thereof by the carrier or insurance company is not subject to tax.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tax-free sale of articles for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) An article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) and this section, for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export. See paragraph (a)(10) of § 48.0-2 for the meaning of the term “export”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under the provisions of this section only if the person to whom the manufacturer sells the article intends either to export the article or to resell it to a person who intends to export it. An article may not be sold tax free under the provisions of this section by a manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser which does not intend to export the article itself but plans to resell it to a third purchaser for export. See section 6416 (b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 48.6416(b)-2 for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are exported from the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) If an article, otherwise taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code:</P>
              <P>(i) Is sold tax free by the manufacturer pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) and this section, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Is returned subsequently to the United States in an unused and undamaged condition,</P>
              <FP>then the importer is liable for the tax imposed by Chapter 32 on the subsequent sale or use of the article in the United States. The provisions of this paragraph (a)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples:</FP>
              
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
                <P>Q, a U.S. motor vehicle manufacturer, previously sold a truck chassis to R, a company in Canada. The sale was tax free under section 4221(a)(2). R mounted a truck body on the truck chassis and sold the completed vehicle to S. Thereafter S sold the completed new vehicle to T who imported the vehicle into the United States and sold it. The sale of the completed truck subjects T to an excise tax liability under section 4061(a)(1) with respect to both the body and the chassis.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>

                <P>X, a U.S. manufacturer of trucks, sold a trash collection truck to Y, a company in France. The sale was tax free under section 4221(a)(2). The truck was sold <PRTPAGE P="197"/>by Y to the City of Nice, France. After initial use, the city determined that the truck was not suited for its needs and resold the truck to X. X returned the truck to the United States where it was resold. The resale of the truck by X does not subject X to an excise tax liability under section 4061(a)(1).</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export.</E> In the case of sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, where the first purchaser or the second purchaser is located in a foreign country or possession of the United States, such purchaser is not required to register as provided in section 4222(a) and § 48.4222(a)-1. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain from such purchaser at the time title to the article passes or at the time of shipment, whichever is earlier, either:</P>
              <P>(1) A written order or contract of sale showing that the manufacturer is to ship the article to a foreign destination; or</P>
              <P>(2) Where delivery by the manufacturer is to be made within the United States, a statement from the purchaser showing:</P>
              <P>(i) That the article is purchased either to fill existing or future orders for delivery to a foreign destination or for resale to another person engaged in the business of exporting who will export the article, and</P>
              <P>(ii) That such article will be transported to its foreign destination in due course prior to use or further manufacture and prior to any resale except for export.</P>
              <FP>See section 4221(b) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for requirements as to timely proof of exportation and cessation of the exemption for export unless the evidence to show actual exportation has been received by the manufacturer.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cessation of exemption.</E> The exemption provided in section 4221(a)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section for an article sold by the manufacturer for export or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export shall cease to apply on the first day following the close of the 6-month period which begins on the date of the sale of the article by the manufacturer, or the date of shipment of the article by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier, unless within the 6-month period the manufacturer receives proof, in the form prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section, that the article was actually exported. If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month period, the proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the article was actually sold.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Proof of exportation.</E> (1) Exportation may be evidenced by:</P>
              <P>(i) A copy of the export bill of lading issued by the delivering carrier,</P>
              <P>(ii) A certificate by the agent or representative of the export carrier showing actual exportation of the article,</P>
              <P>(iii) A certificate of landing signed by a customs officer of the foreign country to which the article is exported,</P>
              <P>(iv) Where the foreign country has no customs administration, a statement of the foreign consignee showing receipt of the article, or</P>
              <P>(v) Where a department or agency of the United States Government is unable to furnish any one of the foregoing four types of proof of exportation, a statement or certification on the department or agency stationery, executed by an authorized officer, that the listed or identified articles have, in fact, been exported.</P>

              <P>(2) In any case where the manufacturer is not the exporter, the manufacturer must have in its possession a statement from the vendee to whom the manufacturer sold the article stating that the article was in fact exported in due course by the vendee or was sold to another person who in due course exported the article. The statement must state what evidence is available to establish that the article was in fact exported in due course prior to use or further manufacture and prior to resale in the United States other than for export. Such evidence must be that described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and the statement <PRTPAGE P="198"/>must show where such evidence is readily available for inspection by Government officers, and should be in substantially the following form:</P>

Sales of supplies to civil aircraft when engaged in trade between the Atlantic and the Pacific ports of the United States are not exempt from the tax imposed under Chapter 32. See section 4221(e)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section for requirement of reciprocal exemption in the case of a civil aircraft registered in a foreign country.<PRTPAGE P="200"/>

              <P>(8) <E T="03">Trade.</E> The term “trade” includes the transportation of persons or property for hire and the making of the necessary preparations for such transportation. The term “trade” also includes the transportation of property on a vessel or aircraft owned or chartered by the owner of the property in connection with the purchase, sale, or exchange of the property in a commercial business operation. However, a vessel owned or chartered by a company and used in the transportation of personnel or property of such company to or from its business properties located in a foreign country, or in a possession of the United States, is not engaged in “trade”.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reciprocity required in the case of civil aircraft.</E> The exemption provided by section 4221(a)(3) and paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the sales of supplies for civil aircraft registered in a foreign country is further limited in that the privilege of exemption may be granted only if the Secretary of Commerce advises the Secretary of the Treasury that the foreign country allows, or will allow, substantially the same reciprocal privileges. If a foreign country discontinues the allowance of such substantially reciprocal exemption, the exemption allowed by the United States will not apply after the Secretary of the Treasury is notified by the Secretary of Commerce of the discontinuance of the exemption allowed by the foreign country.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Evidence required to establish exemption</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The exemption provided in section 4221(a)(3) and paragraph (a) of this section for articles sold for use by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft applies only (i) if both the manufacturer and purchaser are registered under the provisions of section 4222 or (ii) the purchaser or both the manufacturer and the purchaser are not registered but have satisfied the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. See paragraph (c) of § 48.4221-1 for the evidence required to establish exemption where the purchaser is registered pursuant to section 4222 and § 48.4222(a)-1.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemption certificates for use in support of tax-free sales of supplies for vessels and aircraft.</E> (i) In order to establish exemption from tax under section 4221(a)(3) in those instances where the purchaser or both the manufacturer and purchaser are not registered under section 4222, the manufacturer must obtain (prior to or at the time of the sale) from the owner, charterer, or authorized agent of the vessel or aircraft and retain in the manufacturer's possession a properly executed exemption certificate in the form prescribed by subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (d)(2). If articles are sold tax free for use as supplies for civil aircraft employed in foreign trade or in trade between the United States and any of its possessions, the exemption certificate must show the name of the country in which the aircraft is registered.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where only occasional sales of articles are made to a purchaser for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, a separate exemption certificate shall be furnished for each order. However, where sales are regularly or frequently made to a purchaser for such exempt use, a certificate covering all orders for a specified period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters will be acceptable. Such certificates and proper records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be kept for inspection by the district director as provided in section 6001 and the regulations thereunder.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> An article (excluding an automobile subject to tax under section 4064) subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(4) and this section, to a State or local government for the exclusive use of such State or local government. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “State or local government”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale is made directly to a State or local government for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a State or local government for its exclusive use, even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. A sale of an article to a State or local government for resale is not considered to be a sale for the “exclusive use” of the State or local government, within the meaning of section 4221(a)(4), and, therefore, such sales may not be made tax free. Such sales are not exempt regardless of whether the resales are made to government employees, or the fact that the article is an item of equipment the employee is required to possess in carrying out his duties. For example, pistols or revolvers may not be sold tax free to a State or local government for resale to its police officers. See section 6416(b)(2)(C), and paragraph (b)(3) of § 48.6416(b)-2, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a State or local government.</P>

If it is impracticable to furnish a separate certificate for each order or contract because of a frequency of purchases, a certificate covering all orders between given dates (such period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters) will be acceptable.

See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “nonprofit educational organization”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(D), and paragraph (b)(4) of § 48.6416(b)-2, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a nonprofit educational organization.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonprofit educational organization.</E> The term “nonprofit educational organization” means an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) that is exempt from income tax under section 501(a). Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) describes an “educational organization” as one that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on. The term also includes a school operated as an activity of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a), provided the primary function of such school is the presentation of formal instruction and <PRTPAGE P="203"/>provided such school normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.</P>

At the time of sale, the registration number assigned to the purchaser by the district director together with the purpose for which the article was purchased must be shown on (or attached to) the invoice, purchase order, or other document used for the sale.</P>

If the manufacturer has not received the required information within such 6-month period, the temporary suspension of the liability for the payment of the tax ceases, and the manufacturer shall include the tax on the sale of the tire or inner tube in his return for the period in which the 6-month period expires.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Meaning of terms</E>—(1) <E T="03">Qualified bus.</E> “Qualified bus” means an intercity, local, or school bus.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Intercity or local bus.</E> “Intercity or local bus” means any automobile bus which is used predominantly (more than 50 percent) in furnishing (for compensation) passenger land transportation available to the general public if such transportation is scheduled and along regular routes, or if the seating capacity of the bus is at least 20 adults (not including the driver). In determining predominant use, mileage travelled with passengers as well as mileage travelled incidental to such passenger transportation, such as “deadheading”, is counted. Under the first alternative, the size of the bus is not relevant for purposes of determining whether or not the use of the bus qualifies for the exemption. Under the second alternative, for non-scheduled bus operations, such as that provided by charter buses, the exemption is available only if the bus has a passenger seating capacity of at least 20 adults and the transportation is available to the general public. For purposes of determining whether the bus has a seating capacity of at least 20 adults, the bus driver is not included.

Incidental use (deadheading) of the school bus without passengers to or from a point to which students or employees of school are transported is considered to <PRTPAGE P="205"/>be a use which involves transporting students or employees of schools. A school is any educational organization which normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are carried on. Tax-exempt schools, taxable schools, and a private contractor who operates a bus for tax-exempt or a taxable school may qualify for the tax exemption if all the requirements of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Registration requirements for tires, tubes, and tread rubber; vendees purchasing tax free.</E> The provisions of section 4221(e)(5) do not apply with respect to any sale unless the manufacturer and the vendee are registered as required under section 4222, and unless they comply with all the requirements under that section relating to tax-free sales. See § 48.4222 (a)-1. Persons not required to be registered under section 4222(b) may purchase articles tax free by following the same procedures that apply to them in the case of other tax-free sales. See § 48.4222(b)-1. A person's registration and right to sell or purchase articles tax free may be revoked or suspended as provided in § 48.4222(c).1. Such a revocation or suspension shall be in addition to any other penalties that may apply.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Information; records</E>—(1) <E T="03">Information to be furnished to purchaser.</E> A manufacturer selling tires, tubes, or tread rubber tax free under section 4221(e)(5) shall indicate to the purchaser that the purchaser is obtaining the tires or tubes tax free for the purpose of use on or in connection with a qualified bus, and that the purchaser is obtaining the tread rubber tax free for use in the recapping or retreading of tires to be used by the purchaser on or in connection with a qualified bus. The manufacturer may transmit this information by any convenient means, such as coding of sales invoices, provided that the information is presented with sufficient particularity so that the purchaser is informed that the purchaser has obtained the tires, tubes, and tread rubber tax free.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Records of manufacturer.</E> A manufacturer selling tires, tubes, or tread rubber tax free under section 4221(e)(5) shall maintain in its records the identity of the purchaser, a signed statement of the exempt purpose for purchasing the tires, tubes, or tread rubber, and the quantity of tires, tubes, or tread rubber sold tax free to each purchaser.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Records of purchaser.</E> A person purchasing tires, tubes, or tread rubber tax free under section 4221(e)(5) must maintain sufficient records to establish that the tires, tubes, or tread rubber purchased tax free has actually been used for that purpose.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Duty of selling manufacturer to ascertain validity of tax-free sale.</E> The selling manufacturer is not relieved of liability under the provisions of section 4221(e)(5) by reason of section 4221(c) for the tax imposed by section 4061(b) if at the time of sale the selling manufacturer has knowledge or reason to believe that the tires, tubes, or tread rubber sold by it to the purchaser are not intended for use on an intercity, local, or school bus, or that the purchaser has failed to register, or that its registration has been revoked or suspended.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> Section 4221(e)(5) (relating to tires, tubes, and tread rubber) applies to sales on or after December 1, 1978. The sale of tires, tubes, or tread rubber sold prior to that date is not exempt from tax under section 4221(e)(5).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purchasing manufacturer to be treated as the manufacturer.</E> For purposes of Chapter 32, a manufacturer or producer to whom an article is sold or resold tax free under section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use by it in further manufacture shall be treated as the manufacturer or producer of such article. If a manufacturer who purchases an article tax free for further manufacture does not use the article for further manufacture, the sale of the article by it, or its use of the article other than in further manufacture, shall, for purposes of the taxes imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code, be treated as a sale or use of the article by the manufacturer thereof. See paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for determination of taxable sale price where an article purchased tax free for further manufacture is resold, or used other than in further manufacture.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of tax.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the tax liability referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be based on the price for which the article was sold by the purchasing manufacturer, or, where the manufacturer uses the article for a purpose other than which it was purchased, the tax shall be based on the price at which such or similar articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade by manufacturers, producers, or importers thereof. See section 4218(e) and § 48.4218-5.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Election.</E> (1) Instead of computing the tax as described under paragraph (b) of this section, the purchasing manufacturer who has incurred liability for tax on its sale or use of an article as provided by paragraph (a) of this section may compute the tax incurred under Chapter 32 by using as the tax base either the price for which the article was sold to it by the first purchaser, if any, or the price for which such article was sold by the actual manufacturer, producer, or importer of such article. The purchasing manufacturer must have in its possession information upon which to substantiate such basis for tax. For purposes of this paragraph, the price for which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer or by the first purchaser shall be determined as provided in section 4216 and the regulations thereunder. However, such price shall not be adjusted for any discount, rebate, allowance, return, or repossession of a container or covering, or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(2) The election under this paragraph shall be in the form of a statement attached to the return reporting the tax applicable to the sale or use of the article which gave rise to such tax liability. Such election, once made, may not be revoked.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Floor stocks credit or refund.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> This section sets forth the procedures to be followed in claiming the credit or refund authorized by section 6412 for manufacturers excise taxes paid in respect of certain articles held by dealers as floor stocks on October 1, 1988. See § 48.6412-2 for definitions of the following terms when used in this section: “floor stocks”, “inventory date”, “dealer”, “held by a dealer”, “old rate”, “new rate”, “dealer request limitation date”, “claim limitation date”, and “tax paid”. See § 48.6412-3 for determining the amount of tax paid on articles that are held as floor stocks. The manufacturers excise taxes for which credit or refund may be claimed under this section are those imposed by section 4071, relating to tires of the type used on highway vehicles; and section 4081, relating to gasoline. For definition of the term “highway vehicle”, see § 48.4061(a)-1(d).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of the amount of floor stocks credit or refund.</E> The amount of floor stocks credit or refund which may be claimed by the manufacturer under section 6412(a)(1) may not exceed an amount equal to the difference between the tax paid by the manufacturer on the sale of the article and the amount of tax made applicable to the article on the inventory date. No interest is allowable with respect to any amount of tax credited or refunded under section 6412 and this section. In applying the floor stocks credit or refund provisions, the date on which the manufacturer paid the tax with respect to the article held as floor stocks is not relevant. Thus, the period of limitations provided in section 6511 with respect to claims for credit or refund does not apply; however, see paragraph (f) of this section. For definition of the term “manufacturer”, see § 48.0-2(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> Except as provided in § 48.6412-3, no credit or refund is allowable under this section for an amount paid as tax which may be credited or refunded under any provisions of law other than section 6412(a)(1), or which was allowable as a credit or refund under section 6412 with respect to an earlier inventory date.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Relationship between credits or refunds for floor stocks and credits or refunds for price readjustments.</E> The amount which may be credited or refunded for floor stocks and for price readjustments on an article may not in the aggregate exceed the tax paid in respect of the article. A credit or refund computed on the basis of the old tax rate will be allowed with respect to a price readjustment of an article on which a floor stock credit or refund was allowed, but only if the amount of the floor stock credit or refund otherwise allowable was reduced by taking into account such price readjustment, as determined under § 48.6412-3(e). The manufacturer must keep readily available for inspection sufficient records to enable examining officers of the Internal Revenue Service to ascertain the correctness of any claim for credit or refund for a price readjustment of an article on which a floor stock refund was claimed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Participation of dealers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request by dealer.</E> On or before the dealer request limitation date, a dealer may submit to a manufacturer a request with respect to a credit or refund allowable under this section for tax paid by the manufacturer with respect to articles held by the dealer as floor stocks. This request may be submitted directly to the manufacturer, or it may be submitted to him indirectly through another dealer in the distribution chain if the request is received by the manufacturer or an authorized agent of the manufacturer on or before the dealer request limitation date.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Requirements for claim by manufacturer.</E> No amount of credit or refund under this section may be claimed by a manufacturer with respect to articles <PRTPAGE P="209"/>held by a dealer as floor stocks unless—</P>
              <P>(i) The claim for the amount is based upon a request submitted by the dealer to the claimant on or before the dealer request limitation date;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount is paid by the claimant to the dealer, or the dealer's written consent to allowance of the credit or refund has been received by the claimant, on or before the claim limitation date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The request by the dealer is supported by an inventory statement, made under the penalties of perjury and signed by the dealer or by the dealer's authorized representative, setting forth the following information:</P>
              <P>(A) The name and address of the dealer and of the applicable manufacturer, (if the name and address of the applicable manufacturer is unknown to the dealer, these items may be added by any person in the chain of distribution);</P>
              <P>(B) The identification number, if any, of the article, such as a serial, stock, model, type, or class number, or some other suitable means of identification;</P>
              <P>(C) A brief description of the article, such as its common name or designation; and</P>
              <P>(D) The quantity of articles held by the dealer as floor stocks on the inventory date.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Actual manufacturer unknown.</E> If a dealer addresses a request to the person, who from markings on the article the dealer presumes to be the manufacturer, the request may be treated as made to the actual manufacturer if the actual manufacturer accepts the dealer's request.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Payment to dealer by claimant.</E> Payment may be made directly to the dealer or to the dealer's authorized agent or representative by the claimant or by the claimant's authorized agent or representative. If a claimant pays a dealer through the claimant's agent or representative, the evidence must show that the dealer actually received the payment. If a dealer authorizes the claimant to pay the dealer through the dealer's agent or representative, evidence showing receipt of the payment by the agent or representative will be accepted as proof of actual payment to the dealer. Payment shall be made, at the manufacturer's option, in cash, by check, or by credit to the dealer's account as maintained by the claimant. The amount of the payment which may be made by crediting the dealer's account may not exceed the undisputed debit balance due at the time the credit is made. However, payment may be made in merchandise at the dealer's option with the concurrence of the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Date of performance.</E> The date on which any act described in this paragraph (e) is performed by an agent or representative on behalf of a claimant or dealer is deemed to be the date on which the act is performed by the principal.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Record of inventories.</E> For provisions relating to the record of a dealer's inventories to be kept by the claimant, see paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Sample written consent.</E> No particular form is prescribed or required for the written consent of the dealer described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. However, the following is an example of an acceptable consent statement by a dealer:</P>

If the total amount which may be claimed exceeds the amount that may be claimed as credit on a return, the excess amount may be claimed on or before the applicable claim limitation date either as a refund or as a credit on a subsequent return. If credit is claimed the amount of the credit shall be entered as a credit on a timely-filed return of tax.

              <P>For purposes of section 6412 and the regulations thereunder—</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Floor stocks.</E> The term “floor stocks” means any article subject to the tax imposed by section 4071 or section 4081 which—</P>
              <P>(1) Is sold by the manufacturer (otherwise than in a tax-free sale) before October 1, 1988,</P>
              <P>(2) Is held by a dealer at the first moment on October 1, 1988, and has not been used, and</P>
              <P>(3) Is intended for sale.</P>
              <FP>However, the term “floor stocks” does not include gasoline in retail stocks held at the place where intended to be sold at retail, nor with respect to gasoline held for sale by a producer or importer of gasoline.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Inventory date.</E> The term “inventory date” means the first moment on the date on which an article is treated as floor stocks within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Dealer.</E> The term “dealer” includes a wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Held by a dealer</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> (i) An article is considered as “held by a dealer” if title to the article has passed to the dealer (whether or not delivery to the dealer has been made), and if, for purposes of consumption, title to or possession of the article has not at any time been transferred to any person other than a dealer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Floor samples, demonstrators, and articles undergoing repair (whether or not on the dealer's premises) that are carried in stock to be sold as new articles, and articles purchased tax-paid by a manufacturer or a sales subsidiary and held by the person on the inventory date for resale as such, will be considered as unused and held by a dealer, if title to or possession of the article has not at any time been transferred to any person for purposes of consumption.</P>
              <P>(iii) Articles sold by a dealer to a consumer before the inventory date and thereafter repossessed by the dealer, and articles purchased tax-paid by a manufacturer for use in further manufacture within the meaning of section 4221(d)(6), will not be considered as held by a dealer.</P>
              <P>(iv) The determination as to the time title or possession passes for purposes of consumption shall be made under applicable local law.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The application of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following examples:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
                <P>If, under local law, title to an article sold by a dealer under a conditional sales contract is in the dealer on the inventory date, but the consumer has physical possession of the article on that date, the article is not considered as held by the dealer.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>

                <P>If, under local law, title to an article is in the consumer on the inventory date because the article is specifically identified with a contract, but on that date the <PRTPAGE P="212"/>dealer still has physical possession of the article, for example, in his will-call department, the article is not considered as held by the dealer on that date because title to the article has passed to the consumer for purposes of consumption.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (3).</HD>
                <P>If, under local law, title to an article is in the consumer on the inventory date because the dealer transferred the article to a common carrier for delivery to the consumer, the article in transit is not considered as held by the dealer on that date because title has passed to the consumer for purposes of consumption, even though neither the dealer nor the consumer has physical possession of the article.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (4).</HD>
                <P>If, under local law, title to an article is in the dealer on the inventory date and does not pass to the consumer until delivery by a common carrier, the article in transit shall be considered as held by the dealer on that date because neither the title nor possession has passed to the consumer for purposes of consumption.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (5).</HD>
                <P>If an article has been mortgaged or otherwise hypothecated by a dealer as security for a loan and, under local law, title to the article is in the creditor on the inventory date, and physical possession is in the dealer, the article shall be considered as held by the dealer on that date because neither title nor possession has passed to the consumer for purposes of consumption.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Old rate.</E> The term “old rate” means the rate of tax in effect with respect to the sale of an article before the date designated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section on which the tax is reduced in rate or is terminated.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">New rate.</E> The term “new rate” means the rate of tax, if any, in effect with respect to the sale of an article on the date designated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section on which the tax is reduced in rate or is terminated.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Dealer request limitation date.</E> The term “dealer request limitation date” is the date prescribed by section 6412(a)(1) before which the request on which the manufacturer's claim is based must be submitted to the manufacturer by the dealer who held the floor stocks on the inventory date. In the case of an article held by a dealer on October 1, 1988, the dealer request limitation date is January 1, 1989.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Claim limitation date.</E> The term “claim limitation date” means the last date prescribed by section 6412(a)(1) on which refund or credit with respect to floor stocks may be claimed by a manufacturer. In the case of an article held by a dealer on October 1, 1988, the claim limitation date is March 31, 1989.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Tax paid.</E> A tax is considered paid if it was paid or was offset by an allowable credit on the return on which it was reported.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 48.6412-3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Amount of tax paid on each article.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> For purposes of making the claim for credit or refund under § 48.6412-1 in respect of floor stocks held by a dealer, the tax paid on each article must be separately computed. If desired, the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section may be used in making the computation. The procedure used in determining the tax paid on an article must also be used in determining the amount of tax, if any, made applicable to the article on the effective date of reduction or repeal of the tax involved. Prior approval of the Internal Revenue Service for the method of computation need not be obtained and should not be requested.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Selling price.</E> In determining the price of an article on which the tax paid is to be computed, the average of the gross selling prices of identical articles sold during a representative period may be used. For example, truck chassis of the same model that are sold by the manufacturer with the same equipment and accessories are identical articles whose selling prices may be computed on the basis of an average.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Transportation charges.</E> In determining the price of an article on which the tax paid is to be computed, the average of the exclusions authorized by section 4216(a) for transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, etc., for a reasonable category of articles during a representative period may be used.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Credits for tax paid on inner tubes.</E> The average of the credits authorized by section 6416(c) for tax paid on tires or inner tubes may be averaged for a reasonable category of articles during a representative period. The credits shall be subtracted from the gross excise tax to arrive at the net excise tax paid.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Price readjustments.</E> (1) In determining the price on which the tax paid <PRTPAGE P="213"/>is to be computed, there must be taken into account any price readjustments with respect to which the manufacturer has filed a claim for credit or refund under section 6416(b). Other price readjustments which have been, or are reasonably expected to be, made with respect to the article may, at the option of the manufacturer, be taken into account in computing the price of the article.</P>
              <P>(2) Price readjustments which cannot be attributed to specific articles as of the inventory date (as, for example, a price readjustment of a flat dollar amount which is made to dealers who meet a sales quota) may be taken into account on the basis of an average of the adjustments which is computed for a reasonable category of articles over a representative period.</P>
              <P>(3) Price readjustments related to specific items (as, for example, an automatic rebate of a specific percentage of the price of each unit sold to a dealer) may not be averaged, and in such a case only the actual price readjustment attributable to a particular article may be taken into account in computing the tax on that article.</P>
              <P>(4) If, because of the facts in a case, a price readjustment can be attributed to specific articles for purposes of consumer refunds but cannot be attributed to specific articles for purposes of floor stocks credits or refunds, the price adjustment may be averaged for purposes of both consumer refunds and floor stocks credits and refunds.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Representative period.</E> A period will be considered a representative period if—</P>
              <P>(1) It covers (i) at least four consecutive calendar quarters, the last of which ends with a period of six calendar months immediately preceding the effective date of the tax reduction or repeal involved or (ii) any other period of time which the taxpayer can demonstrate constitutes a representative period for the particular category, and</P>
              <P>(2) The number of articles in the category involved sold by the manufacturer during the period either (i) equals or exceeds the number of articles in the category to which the average amount is to be applied or (ii) can be demonstrated by the taxpayer to be a representative quantity.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reasonable category.</E> Examples of a reasonable category of articles are articles that are identified by a common stock or class number or which are of the same model, class, or line. For the purpose of averaging exclusions, another example of a reasonable category of articles is a grouping of articles that are shipped in the same container. If a manufacturer sells articles bearing his own trademark and also sells articles as private brands, separate computations of the two brands must be made under this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Price readjustments causing overpayments of manufacturers tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 that is determined to be an overpayment by reason of a price readjustment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) and § 48.6416(b)(1)-2 or § 48.6416(b)(1)-3, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which the person subsequently files. Price readjustments may not be anticipated. However, if the readjustment has actually been made before the return is filed for the period in which the sale was made, the tax to be reported in respect of the sale may, at the election of the taxpayer, be based either (a) on the price as so readjusted or (b) on the original sale price and a credit or refund claimed in respect of the price readjustment. A price readjustment will be deemed to have been made at the time when the amount of the readjustment has been refunded to the vendor or the vendor has been informed that the vendor's account has been credited with the amount. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund, see § 301.6402-2 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration), § 48.6416(a)-3(a)(2), and § 48.6416(b)(1)-4.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rules of usual application</E>—(i) <E T="03">Amount treated as overpayment.</E> If the tax imposed by chapter 32 has been paid and thereafter the price of the article on which the tax was based is readjusted, that part of the tax which is proportionate to the part of the price which is repaid or credited to the purchaser is considered to be an overpayment. A readjustment of price to the purchaser may occur by reason of—</P>
              <P>(A) The return of the article,</P>
              <P>(B) The repossession of the article,</P>
              <P>(C) The return or repossession of the covering or container of the article, or</P>
              <P>(D) A bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance against the price at which the article was sold.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Requirements of price readjustment.</E> A price readjustment will not be deemed to have been made unless the person who paid the tax either—</P>

              <P>(A) Repays part or all of the purchase price in cash to the vendee,<PRTPAGE P="217"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) Credits the vendee's account for part or all of the purchase price, or</P>
              <P>(C) Directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee.</P>
              <FP>In addition, to be deemed a price readjustment, the payment or credit must be contractually or economically related to the taxable sale that the payment or credit purports to adjust. Thus, commissions or bonuses paid to a manufacturer's own agents or salesperson for selling the manufacturer's taxable products are not price readjustments for purposes of this section, since those commissions or bonuses are not paid or credited either to the manufacturer's vendee or to a third party for the vendee's benefit. On the other hand, a bonus paid by the manufacturer to a dealer's salesperson for negotiating the sale of a taxable article previously sold to the dealer by the manufacturer is considered to be a readjustment of the price on the original sale of the taxable article, regardless of whether the payment to the salesperson is made directly by the manufacturer or to the salesperson through the dealer. In such a case, the payment is related to the sale of a taxable article and is made for the benefit of the dealer because it is made to the dealer's salesperson to encourage the sale of a product owned by the dealer. Similarly, payments or credits made by a manufacturer to a vendee as reimbursement of interest expense incurred by the vendee in connection with a so-called “free flooring” arrangement for the purchase of taxable articles is a price readjustment, regardless of whether the payment or credit is made directly to the vendee or to the vendee's creditor on behalf of the vendee.</FP>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Limitation on credit or refund.</E> The credit or refund allowable by reason of a price readjustment in respect of the sale of a taxable article may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax originally due and payable on the article as the amount of the tax-included readjustment bears to the original tax-included sale price of the article.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                <P>A manufacturer sells a taxable article for $100 plus $10 excise tax, and reports and pays tax liability accordingly. Thereafter, the manufacturer credits the customer's account for $11 (tax included) in readjustment of the original sale price. The overpayment of tax is $1, determined as follows:</P>
                <FP>Tax-included readjustment ×</FP>
                <FP>Tax-included sale price</FP>
                <FP>Original tax due =</FP>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rules of special application</E>—(i) <E T="03">Constructive sale price.</E> If, in the case of a taxable sale, the tax imposed by chapter 32 is based on a constructive sale price determined under any paragraph of section 4216(b) and the regulations thereunder, as determined without reference to section 4218, then any price readjustment made with respect to the sale may be taken into account under this section only to the extent that the price readjustment reduces the actual sale price of the article below the constructive sale price.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                <P>(A) A manufacturer sells a taxable article at retail for $110 tax included. Under section 4216(b)(1) the constructive sale price (tax included) of the article is determined to be $93. Thereafter, the manufacturer grants an allowance of $10 to the purchaser, which reduces the actual selling price (tax included) to $100. Since the readjustment price still exceeds the amounts of the constructive sale price, this readjustment is not recognized as a price readjustment under this section.</P>
                <P>(B) Subsequently, the manufacturer extends to the purchaser an additional price allowance of $10, thereby reducing the actual sale price to $90. Since the actual sale price is now $3 less than the constructive sale price of $93, the manufacturer has overpaid by the amount of tax attributable to the $3. Assuming the tax rate involved is 10 percent, and the prices involved are tax-included, the overpayment of tax would be $0.27, determined as follows:</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Price determined under section 4223(b)(2).</E> If a manufacturer (within the meaning of section 4223(a)) to whom an article is sold or resold free of tax in accordance with the provisions of section 4221(a)(1) for use in further manufacture diverts the article to a taxable use or sells it in a taxable sale, and pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2) computes the tax liability in respect of the use or sale on the price for which the article was sold to the manufacturer or on the price at which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer, a reduction of the price on which the tax was based does not result in an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) of this section. Moreover, if a manufacturer purchases an article tax free and computes the tax in respect of a subsequent sale of the article pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2), an overpayment does not arise by reason of readjustment of the price for which the article was sold by the manufacturer except where the readjustment results from the return or repossession of the article by the manufacturer, and all of the purchase price is refunded by the manufacturer. See, however, paragraph (b)(4) of this section as to repurchased articles.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Return of an article</E>—(1) <E T="03">Price readjustment.</E> If a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 on the sale of the article, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment results—</P>
              <P>(i) If the article is returned before use, and all of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or</P>
              <P>(ii) If the article is returned under an express or implied warranty as to quality or service, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or</P>
              <P>(iii) If title is still in the seller, as, for example, in the case of certain installment sales contracts, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Return of purchase price.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if all of the purchase price of an article has been returned to the vendee, except for an amount retained by the manufacturer pursuant to contract as reimbursement of expense incurred in connection with the sale (such as a handling or restocking charge), all of the purchase price is considered to have been returned to the vendee.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Taxability of subsequent sale or use.</E> If, under any of the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and all of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, the sale is considered to have been rescinded. Any subsequent sale or use of the article by the manufacturer will be considered to be an original sale or use of the article by the manufacturer which is subject to tax under chapter 32 unless otherwise exempt. If under any such condition an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and only part of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, a subsequent sale of the article by the manufacturer will be subject to tax to the extent that the sale price exceeds the adjusted sale price of the first taxable sale.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Treatment of other transactions as repurchases.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a price readjustment will not result when a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax on the sale of the article, even though all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, since such a transaction will be considered to be a repurchase of the article by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Repossession of an article.</E> If a taxable article is repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 on the sale of the article, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. However, if the manufacturer later resells the repossessed article for a price in excess of the original adjusted sale price, the manufacturer will be liable for tax under chapter 32 to the extent that the resale price exceeds the original adjusted sale price.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Return or repossession of covering or container.</E> If the covering or container of a taxable article is returned to, or repossessed by the manufacturer who <PRTPAGE P="219"/>paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 on the sale of the article, and all or a portion of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account by reason of the return or repossession of the covering or container, a price adjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. If a taxable article is considered to have been repurchased, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the covering or container accompanies the taxable article as part of the transaction, the covering or container will also be considered to have been repurchased.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Bona fide discounts, rebates, or allowances</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in § 48.6416(b)(1)-3 (relating to readjustments in respect of local advertising), the basic consideration in determining, for purposes of this section, whether a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance has been made is whether the price actually paid by, or charged against, the purchaser has in fact been reduced by subsequent transactions between the parties. Generally, the price will be considered to have been readjusted by reason of a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance, only if the manufacturer who made the taxable sale repays a part of the purchase price in cash to the vendee, or credits the vendee's account, or directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee, in consideration of factors which, if taken into account at the time of the original transaction, would have resulted at that time in a lower sale price. For example, a price readjustment will be considered to have been made when a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance is given in consideration of such factors as prompt payment, quantity buying over a specified period, the vendee's inventory of an article when new models are introduced, or a general price reduction affecting articles held in stock by the vendee as of a certain date. On the other hand, repayments made to the vendee do not effectuate price readjustments if given in consideration of circumstances under which the vendee has incurred, or is required to incur, an expense which, if treated as a separate item in the original transaction, would have been includible in the price of the article for purposes of computing the tax.</P>

An additional amount of Y dollars is paid to the dealer upon a showing by the dealer that the dealer has paid Y dollars to the salesperson who made the sale. In this case, the X dollars paid to the dealer by C constitutes a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance since payment of such amount is in the nature of a price reduction by reason of the dealer's inventory when new models are introduced. In addition, the Y dollars paid to the dealer in reimbursement for the amount paid by the dealer to the salesperson who made the sale, also constitutes a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Loss or damage in transit.</E> If title to an article has passed to the vendee, the subsequent loss, damage, or destruction of the article while in the possession of a carrier for delivery to the vendee does not, in and of itself, affect the price at which the article was sold. However, if the article was sold under a contract providing that, if the article was lost, damaged, or destroyed in transit, title would revert to the vendor and the vendor would reimburse the vendee in full for the sale price, then the original sale is considered to have been rescinded. The vendor is entitled to credit or refund of the tax <PRTPAGE P="220"/>paid upon reimbursement of the full tax-included sale price to the vendee.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exportations, uses, sales, and resales included.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax paid under chapter 32 (or under section 4041(a) or (d) in respect of sales or under section 4051) with respect to any article is considered to be an overpayment in the case of any exportation, use, sale, or resale described in this section. This section applies only in those cases in which the exportation, use, sale, or resale (or any combination thereof) referred to in this section occurs before any other use. In addition, the following restrictions must be taken into account in applying the regulations under section 6416(b)(2):</P>
              <P>(1) Sections 6416(b)(2)(C) and (D) do not apply to any tax paid under section 4064 (gas guzzler tax).</P>
              <P>(2) Sections 6416(b)(2)(B), (C), and (D) do not apply to any tax paid under section 4131 (vaccine tax) and section 6416(b)(2)(A) applies only to the extent prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 6416(b)(2) does not apply to any tax paid under section 4041(a)(1) or 4081 on diesel fuel or kerosene, section 4091 (aviation fuel tax), or section 4121 (coal tax).</P>
              <P>(4) Beginning on January 1, 2013, sections 6416(b)(2)(B), (C), (D), and (E) do not apply to any tax paid under section 4191 (medical device tax).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exportation of tax-paid articles</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Subject to the limitations of section 6416(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, tax paid under chapter 31 or 32 on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(A) if the article is exported by any person. Except in the case of articles subject to the tax imposed by section 4061(a), prior to April 1, 1983, it is immaterial for purposes of this paragraph (b), whether the person who made the taxable sale had knowledge at the time of the sale that the article or fuel was being purchased for export to a foreign country or shipment to a possession of the United States. See § 48.6416(e)-1 for the circumstances under which a claim for refund by reason of the exportation of an article may be claimed by the exporter or shipper, rather than by the person who paid the tax. For definition of the term “possession of the United States”, see § 48.0-2(a)(11).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rule for exportation of vaccines.</E> Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to tax paid under section 4131 on the sale of a vaccine, but only if the sale by the manufacturer occurs after August 10, 1993, and, in the case of vaccine sold to the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, the condition of § 48.4221-3(e)(2) is satisfied.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Supplies for vessels or aircraft.</E> A payment of tax under chapter 32 on the sale of any article, or under section 4041 (a)(1) or (a)(2) on the sale of diesel fuel or special motor fuel, will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(B) if the article or fuel is used by any person, or is sold by any person for use by the purchaser, as supplies for vessels or aircraft.</P>

              <P>The term “supplies for vessels or aircraft”, as used in this paragraph, has <PRTPAGE P="222"/>the same meaning as when used in sections 4041(g), 4221(a)(3), 4221(d)(3), and 4221(e)(1), and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use by State or local government.</E> A payment of tax under chapter 32 on the sale of any article, or under section 4041 (a)(1) or (a)(2) on the sale of diesel fuel or special motor fuel, will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(C) if the article of fuel is sold by any person to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia for the exclusive use of a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. For provisions relating to tax-free sales to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, see section 4221(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use by nonprofit educational organization.</E> A payment of tax under chapter 32 on the sale of any article, or under section 4041 (a)(1) or (a)(2) on the sale of diesel fuel or special motor fuel, will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(D) if the article or fuel is sold by any person to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. The term “nonprofit educational organization”, as used in this paragraph (e), has the same meaning as when used in section 4221 (a)(5) or (d)(5), whichever applies, and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Tax-paid tires or inner tubes resold for use in further manufacture.</E> A payment of tax under section 4071 on the sale of a tire or, prior to January 1, 1984, on the sale of an inner tube will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(E) if—</P>
              <P>(1) The tire or inner tube is, after the original sale of the article by the manufacturer, resold by any person to another manufacturer;</P>
              <P>(2) The other manufacturer sells the tire or inner tube on or in connection with, or with the sale of, any other article manufactured or produced by the other manufacturer; and</P>
              <P>(3) That other article is by any person either—</P>
              <P>(i) Exported to a foreign country or to a possession of the United States,</P>
              <P>(ii) Sold to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia for the exclusive use of a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia,</P>
              <P>(iii) Sold to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use, or</P>
              <P>(iv) Used or sold for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft.</P>
              <FP>The overpayment described in this paragraph (f) is to be distinguished from the overpayment described in section 6416(b)(3)(C) prior to amendment by the Highway Revenue Act of 1982 and section 6416(b)(3) as amended by the Highway Revenue Act of 1982, and § 48.6416(b)(3)-2 (d) in that the overpayment here described arises from a “resale” for the use described in this paragraph, while the section 6416(b)(3)(C) overpayment arises from the “use” of tires or inner tubes in the manufacture of other articles by a subsequent manufacturer who purchases tax-paid tires or tubes and disposes of finished articles on the basis of one of the exemptions set forth in section 6416(B)(3)(C). A manufacturer claiming a credit or refund under this paragraph (f) must have substantially the same information available in support of the claim as is required under § 48.4221-7(c)(2) in support of exempt sales of tires or inner tubes under the provisions of section 4221(e)(2), except that none of the parties involved need be registered under section 4222.</FP>

This section applies in those cases where the exportation, use, or sale (or any combination of those activities) referred to in any one or more of those paragraphs occurs before any other use. For provisions relating to overpayments arising by reason of <PRTPAGE P="227"/>resales of tax-paid articles for use in further manufacture as provided in this section, see section 6416(b)(2)(E) and paragraph (f) of § 48.6416(b)(2)-2.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of tax-paid articles in further manufacture described in section 6416(b)(3)(A).</E> A payment of tax under chapter 32 on the sale of any article (other than coal taxable under section 4121), directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3)(A) if the article is used by the subsequent manufacturer as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer which is—</P>
              <P>(1) Taxable under chapter 32, or</P>
              <P>(2) An automobile bus chassis or an automobile bus body.</P>
              <FP>For this purpose it is immaterial whether the second article is sold or otherwise disposed of, or if sold, whether the sale is a taxable sale. Any article to which this paragraph (b) applies which would have been used in the manufacture or production of a second article, except for the fact that it was broken or rendered useless in the process of manufacturing or producing the second article, will be considered to have been used as a component part of the second article. This paragraph (b) does not apply to articles sold and used as provided in any of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of truck, bus, etc., parts or accessories.</E> A payment of tax under section 4061 (b) on the sale prior to January 7, 1983, of any truck, bus, etc., part or accessory, directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3)(B) if the part or accessory is used by the subsequent manufacturer as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer. For this purpose it is immaterial whether the second article is or is not taxable under chapter 32. Any article to which this paragraph (c) applies which would have been used in the manufacture or production of a second article, except for the fact that it was broken or rendered useless in the process of manufacturing or producing the second article, will be considered to have been used as a component part of the second article.</P>

              <P>(i) An automobile bus chassis or automobile bus body, or</P>

              <P>(3) If the second article is exported or shipped as provided in this paragraph (d), it is immaterial whether the subsequent manufacturer sold the article with the knowledge that it would be exported or shipped.<PRTPAGE P="228"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) An overpayment arises under paragraph (d)(1) of this section only if the tire or inner tube constitutes a part of, or is associated with, the second article at the time the second article is exported, shipped, sold, used, or sold for use, as prescribed in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(5) For definition of certain terms used in this paragraph, see section 4221 and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(6) For provisions relating to overpayments arising by reason of tires or inner tubes sold tax-paid by the manufacturer of the same, on or in connection with, or with the sale of, any article manufactured or produced by that manufacturer and exported, sold, or used or sold for use, as provided in this paragraph (d), see section 6416(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(7) For provisions relating to credit allowable in respect of tires and inner tubes sold on or in connection with, or with the sale of, another article taxable under chapter 32, prior to January 1, 1984, see section 6416(c) and § 48.6416(c)-1.</P>

For this purpose it is immaterial whether the other article is or is not taxable under chapter 32. For provisions relating to the use of gasoline for nonfuel purposes, see section 4221 and the regulations thereunder.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Allowance of credit against tax on sale of taxable article.</E> If tax has been paid under section 4071 on the sale, or under section 4218 on the use, of a tire or inner tube, and the manufacturer of another article taxable under chapter 32 sells the tire or inner tube on or in connection with the sale of that other article, a credit in respect of the tire or inner tube is allowable under section 6416(c) against the tax imposed on the sale of that other article. The amount of the credit is to be determined as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tires or tubes purchased by manufacturer of the other article.</E> If the manufacturer of the other article purchased the tire or inner tube tax-paid, the amount of the credit shall be determined by applying to the purchase price of the tire or inner tube the percentage rate of tax applicable to the sale of the other article. For this purpose, the purchase price shall be determined by including any tax passed on to the manufacturer and, in the case of a tire, by excluding any part of the price attributable to the metal rim or rim base. For example, if the selling price of an automobile truck is $24,000, tax equivalent to 10 percent of the price (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> $2,400) is imposed under section 4601(a) on the sale (before April 1, 1983) of the automobile truck. If the tires or inner tubes sold on or in connection with the automobile truck are purchased by the manufacturer of the automobile truck for $1,500 (computed as provided in this paragraph) a credit of $150 (10 percent of $1,500) is allowable against the tax imposed on the sale of the automobile truck.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tires or tubes manufactured by manufacturer or other articles.</E> If the manufacturer of the other article is also the manufacturer of the tire or inner tube and incurs tax liability under section 4218 on the use by that manufacturer of the tire or inner tube, the amount of the credit shall be determined by applying to the fair market price of the tire or inner tube, the percentage rate of tax applicable to the sale of the other article.

              <SUBJECT>Credits or payments to ultimate purchaser of gasoline used on a farm.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> If gasoline is used on a farm for farming purposes after June 30, 1965, a credit (under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section) or a payment (under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section) in respect of the gasoline shall be allowed or made to the ultimate purchaser of the gasoline in an amount determined by multiplying (1) the number of gallons of gasoline so used by (2) the rate of tax on gasoline under section 4081 that applied on the date the gasoline was purchased by the ultimate purchaser. No interest shall be paid on any payment, allowed under paragraph (c) of this section. However, interest may be paid on any overpayment (as defined by section 6401) arising from a credit allowed under paragraph (b) of this section. See section 34(a), relating to credit for certain uses of gasoline and special fuels, and lubricating oil used prior to January 7, 1983). See § 48.6420-2 for the time within which a claim for credit or payment must be made. See section 4081 and the regulations thereunder for the rates of tax on gasoline. See § 48.6420-2 for meaning of the terms “Used on a farm for farming purposes,” “farm,” “gasoline,” “ultimate purchaser,” and “taxable year.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Allowance of income tax credit in lieu of payment.</E> With respect to persons subject to income tax, repayment of the tax paid under section 4081 on gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes may be obtained only by claiming a credit for the amount of this tax against the income tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code. The amount of the credit shall be an amount equal to the payment which would be made under section 6420 with respect to gasoline used during the taxable year on a farm for farming purposes if section 6420(g)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section did not apply. See section 34(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Allowance of payment.</E> Payments in respect of gasoline upon which tax was paid under section 4081 that is used on a farm for farming purposes shall be made only to—</P>
              <P>(1) The United States or agency or instrumentality thereof, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an agency or instrumentality of one or more States or political subdivisions of a State, or the District of Columbia, or</P>
              <P>(2) An organization which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) and is not required to made a return of the income tax imposed under subtitle A for its taxable year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of gasoline.</E> (1) The credit or payment described in paragraph (a) of this section is allowable only in respect of gasoline used on a farm in the United States for farming purposes. The credit or payment is not allowable with respect to gasoline used for nonfarming purposes, or gasoline used off a farm, regardless of the nature of the use. If a vehicle or other equipment is used both on a farm and off the farm, or if it is used on a farm both for farming and nonfarming purposes, the credit or payment is allowable only with respect to that portion of the gasoline which was “used on a farm for farming purposes” as defined in paragraph (a) of § 48.6420-4. In determining if this requirement is met, neither the type of <PRTPAGE P="233"/>equipment or vehicle used nor its registration for highway use is material. However, the actual use of the equipment or vehicle and the place where it is used are material. For example, if a truck used on a farm for farming purposes is also used on the highways, gasoline used in connection with operating the truck on the highways is not taken into account in computing the credit or payment.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of determining the allowable credit or payment in respect of gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes, gasoline on hand shall be considered used in the order in which it was purchased. Thus, if the owner, tenant, or operator of a farm has on hand gasoline acquired in two purchases made at different times and subject to different rates of tax, in determining credit or payment for gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes, it will be assumed that the gasoline purchased first was the first gasoline used, and the rate applicable to that purchase will apply in determining the credit or payment, until all that gasoline is accounted for.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Time for filing claim for credit or payment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A claim for credit or payment described in § 48.6420-1 with respect to gasoline used after June 30, 1965, on a farm for farming purposes, shall cover only gasoline used during the taxable year on a farm for farming purposes. Therefore, gasoline on hand at the end of a taxable year as, for example, in fuel supply tanks of farm machinery or in storage tanks or drums, must be excluded from a claim filed for that taxable year (but may be included in a claim filed for a later taxable year if used during that later year on a farm for farming purposes). Gasoline used during a taxable year may be covered by a claim filed for that taxable year although the gasoline was not paid for at the time the claim is filed. For purposes of applying this section, a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6420-1 (c) is considered to have as its taxable year, the calendar year or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books; see paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time for filing.</E> (1) A claim for credit with respect to gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes shall not be allowed unless it is filed no later than the time prescribed by section 6511 and the regulations thereunder for filing a claim for credit or refund of income tax for the particular taxable year.</P>
              <P>(2) A claim for payment of a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6420-1(c) must be filed no later than 3 years following the close of its taxable year. (See paragraph (h) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(3) See § 301.7502-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) for provisions treating timely mailing as timely filing and § 301.7502-1 of this chapter for time for performance of an act where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limit of one claim per taxable year.</E> Not more than one claim may be filed under section 6420 by any person with respect to gasoline used during the same taxable year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Form and content of claim</E>—(1) <E T="03">Claim for credit.</E> (i) The claim for credit with respect to gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes must be made by attaching a Form 4136 to the income tax return of an individual or a corporation. Form 4136 must be executed in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. A partnership may not file Form 4136. When a partnership files Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of Income, it must include a statement showing how many gallons of gasoline are allocated to each partner and the use made of the gasoline.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an individual dies during the taxable year, the claim for credit may be made only for that portion of the individual's taxable year ending with the date of death. If a sole proprietorship, a partnership or corporation is terminated or liquidated during the taxable year, the claim for credit may be made only for the portion of its year ending with the date of the termination or liquidation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Claim for payment.</E> The claim for payment with respect to gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes by a <PRTPAGE P="234"/>governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6420-1(c) must be made on Form 843 in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. The claim by such a unit or organization must be filed with the service center for the internal revenue region in which the principal place of business or principal office of the claimant is located.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exempt sales; other payments or refunds available.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Exempt sales.</E> Credits or payments are allowable only for gasoline that was sold by the producer or importer in a transaction that was subject to tax under section 4081. No credit or payment shall be allowed or made under § 48.6420-1 with respect to gasoline which was exempt from the tax imposed by section 4081. For example, a State or local government may not file a claim with respect to any gasoline which it purchased tax free from the producer, even though the State or local government used the gasoline on a farm for farming purposes. Similarly, payment may not be made with respect to gasoline purchased by a State tax free for its exclusive use, as provided in section 4221, which is used on a State prison farm for farming purposes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other payments or refunds available.</E> Any amount which, without regard to the second sentence of section 6420(d) and this paragraph (b), would be allowable as a credit or payable to any person under § 48.6420-1 with respect to any gasoline is reduced by any other amount which is allowable as a credit or payable under section 6420, or is refundable under any other provision of the Code, to any person with respect to the same gasoline. Thus, a person who is the ultimate purchaser of gasoline may not file a claim for credit or payment with respect to that gasoline if another person is entitled to claim a payment, credit, or refund with respect to the same gasoline. For example, a State or local government may not file a claim for payment if it has executed, or intends to execute, a written consent to enable the producer to claim a credit or refund for the tax that was paid. See, for example, §§ 48.6416(a)-3(b)(2), 48.6416(b)(2)-2(d), and 48.6416(b)(2)-3(b)(1).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Meaning of terms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>For purposes of the regulations under section 6420, unless otherwise expressly indicated—</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Used on a farm for farming purposes.</E> The term “used on a farm for farming purposes” applies only to gasoline which is used (1) in carrying on a trade or business of farming, (2) on a farm in the United States, and (3) for farming purposes. Gasoline used in an aircraft will qualify if its use otherwise satisfies these requirements. For the meaning of the term “trade or business of farming,” see paragraph (b) of this section. For the definition of the term “farm,” see paragraph (c) of this section. For the definition of the term “farming purposes,” see paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section. The term “United States” has the meaning assigned to it by section 7701(a)(9).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Trade or business of farming.</E> A person will be considered to be engaged in the trade or business of farming if the person cultivates, operates, or manages a farm for gain or profit, either as an owner or a tenant. A person engaged in forestry or the growing of timber is not thereby engaged in the trade or business of farming. A person who operates a garden plot, orchard, or farm for the primary purpose of growing produce for the person's own use is not considered to be engaged in the trade or business of farming. Generally, the operation of a farm does not constitute the carrying on of a trade or business if the farm is occupied by a person primarily for residential purposes or is used primarily for pleasure, such as for the entertainment of guests or as a hobby.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Farm.</E> The term “farm” is used in its ordinary and accepted sense, and generally means land used for the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock or poultry. The term “livestock” includes cattle, hogs, horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, goats, and captive fur-bearing animals. The term “poultry” includes chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and pigeons. Thus, a farm includes livestock, dairy, poultry, fish, fruit, fur-bearing animals, <PRTPAGE P="235"/>and truck farms, plantations, ranches, nurseries, ranges, orchards, feed yards for fattening cattle, and greenhouses and other similar structures used primarily for the raising of agricultural or horticultural commodities. Greenhouses and other similar structures that are used primarily for purposes other than the raising of agricultural or horticultural commodities do not constitute farms, as, for example, structures that are used primarily for the display, storage, fabrication, or sale of wreaths, corsages, and bouquets. A fish farm is an area where fish are grown or raised, as opposed to merely caught or harvested.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Gasoline used in cultivating, raising, or harvesting.</E> Gasoline is used for “farming purposes” when it is used on a farm by the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm in connection with cultivating the soil, raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, or raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training, or managing livestock, poultry, bees, or wildlife. Examples of operations which are considered to be operations for “farming purposes” within the meaning of this paragraph include plowing, seeding, fertilizing, weed killing, corn or cotton picking, threshing, combining, baling, silo filling, and chopping silage.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Gasoline used in handling, packing, or storing.</E> (1) Gasoline is used for “farming purposes” when it is used by the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm in handling, drying, packing, grading, or storing any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its unmanufactured state, but only if the owner, tenant, or operator produced more than one-half of the commodity which was so treated during the taxable year for which claim for credit or payment is filed.</P>
              <P>(2) Gasoline used in connection with canning, freezing, packaging, or processing operations will not be considered to be used for farming purposes, even though these operations are performed on a farm. Thus, for example, although gasoline used on a farm in connection with the production or harvesting of maple sap or oleoresin from a living tree is considered to be used for farming purposes under paragraph (d) of this section, gasoline used in the processing of maple sap into maple syrup or maple sugar or used in the processing of oleoresin into gum spirits of turpentine or gum resin is not used for farming purposes, even though these processing operations are conducted on a farm.</P>
              <P>(3) Gasoline used in connection with processing operations which change a commodity from its raw or natural state, or operations performed with respect to a commodity after its character has been changed from its raw or natural state by a processing operation, will not be considered to be used for farming purposes. For example, gasoline used for the extraction of juices from fruits or vegetables is used in a processing operation which changes the character of the fruits or vegetables from their raw or natural state and will not be considered to be used for “farming purposes.”</P>
              <P>(4) The term “commodity,” as used in this paragraph (e), refers to a single agricultural or horticultural product. For example, all apples are treated as a single commodity while apples and peaches are treated as two separate commodities. Operations with respect to each commodity are to be considered separately in applying the “one-half” production test described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Gasoline used in planting, cultivating, or caring for trees.</E> Gasoline is used “for farming purposes” when it is used by the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm in connection with the planting, cultivating, caring for, or cutting of trees that is incidental to the farming operations of the farm on which it is performed or incidental to the farming operations of the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm, or in connection with the preparation (other than milling) of trees for market that is incidental to these farming operations. These operations include the felling of trees and cutting them into logs or firewood but do not include sawing logs into lumber, chipping, or other milling operations. Operations of the prescribed character will be considered incidental to farming operations only if they are of a minor nature in comparison with the total farming operations involved. Therefore, a tree <PRTPAGE P="236"/>farmer or timber grower may not claim credit or payment under § 48.6420-1 with respect to gasoline used in connection with the trade or business of tree farming or timber growing.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Gasoline used in the maintenance of a farm or farm equipment.</E> Gasoline is used “for farming purposes” when it is used by the owner, tenant, or operator of a farm in connection with the operation, management, conservation, improvement, or maintenance of the farm and its tools and equipment. The activities included are those which contribute in any way to the conduct of the farm as such, as distinguished from any other enterprise in which the owner, tenant, or operator may be engaged. Examples of included operations are clearing land, repairing fences and farm buildings, building terraces or irrigation ditches, cleaning tools or farm machinery, and painting farm buildings. Since the gasoline must be used by the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm to which the operations relate, gasoline used by an organization which contracts with a farmer to renovate his farm properties is not used for farming purposes. Gasoline used in a gasoline-powered lawn mower for maintaining a lawn is not used for farming purposes.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Taxable year.</E> The “taxable year” of a governmental unit or tax-exempt organization described in § 48.6420-1(c) is the calendar or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books. The “taxable year” of persons subject to income tax shall have the meaning as it has under section 7701(a)(23).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Gasoline.</E> The term “gasoline” has the same meaning given to this term by section 4082(b) and the regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Ultimate purchaser.</E> The term “ultimate purchaser” includes only a person who is an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm. A person who is an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm is an ultimate purchaser of gasoline only with respect to such gasoline as is purchased by the person and used for farming purposes on a farm of which the person is the owner, tenant, or operator. Thus the owner of a farm who purchases gasoline which is used on the farm by its owner, tenant, or operator for farming purposes is generally the ultimate purchaser of the gasoline. If, however, the cost of gasoline supplied by an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm, is by agreement or other arrangement borne by a second person who is an owner, or operator of the farm, the second person who bore the cost of the gasoline is considered to be the ultimate purchaser of the gasoline.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Certain farming use by persons other than the owner, tenant or operator</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, the owner, tenant, or operator of a farm on which gasoline is used by any other person for the purposes described in section 6420(c)(3)(A) and paragraph (d) of this section (relating to gasoline used in cultivating, raising, or harvesting) will be treated, for the purposes of § 48.6420-1 (a), as the ultimate purchaser who used the gasoline on the farm for farming purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Example.</E> The rule of paragraph (k)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
                <P>Farmer A hired custom operator B to cultivate the soil on A's farm. B used 200 gallons of gasoline which B had purchased in performing the work on A's farm. In addition, A hired Farmer C to do some plowing on A's farm, using C's own tractor and 50 gallons of gasoline which C had purchased. A is deemed to be the ultimate purchaser and user of the gasoline used on A's farm by B and C, and A is entitled to take a credit in respect of the gasoline. Accordingly, no credit in respect to the gasoline may be taken by either B or C.</P>

              <P>(l) <E T="03">Aerial applicators treated as ultimate purchasers</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Section 6420(c)(3)(A) provides that only the owner, tenant, or operator of a farm is entitled to be treated as a user and ultimate purchaser. Section 6420(c)(4) provides that, under section 6420(c)(3)(A), an aerial applicator or other applicator is entitled to be treated as the user and ultimate purchaser of gasoline used by it on a farm for the purposes described in section 6420(c)(3)(A), but only if the owner, tenant, or operator who is otherwise entitled to treatment as the user and ultimate purchaser waives the right to credit or payment. See paragraph (l)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form and manner of waiver.</E> To waive the right to be treated as user <PRTPAGE P="237"/>and ultimate purchaser of gasoline which is used on a farm by an aerial applicator or other applicator, the owner, tenant, or operator of a farm who is otherwise entitled to treatment as user and ultimate purchaser must execute an irrevocable written agreement (as here described) no later than the date on which the aerial applicator or other applicator claiming the credit or payment files its return for the taxable year in which the gasoline is used. The agreement must identify the period for which the owner, tenant, or operator waives the right to credit or payment. The effective period of the waiver cannot extend beyond the last day of the taxable year of the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm on which the gasoline was used. If the owner, tenant, or operator's taxable year extends beyond the taxable year of the applicator, the applicator can only claim a credit or payment for periods included in the applicator's taxable year. Periods after the last day of the applicator's taxable year which are included under the agreement must be claimed on the applicator's return for the next succeeding taxable year. The waiver may be in the form shown under paragraph (l)(6) of this section or in any other form that meets the requirements of this paragraph and clearly states that the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm knowingly waives the right to receive the credit or payment.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Agreement included on aerial applicator's invoice.</E> The agreement waiving a right to receive a credit or payment under section 6420 may be a separate document or may appear on the invoice for aerial application services or other unrelated document from the aerial applicator or other applicator to the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm. If the waiver agreement appears on an invoice or other unrelated document, however, it must be printed in a section of the invoice or other document clearly set off from all other material contained in the invoice or other document, and it must be printed in type sufficiently large to put the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm on notice that the person has waived the right to receive a credit or payment under section 6420. Additionally, if the waiver agreement appears as part of any invoice or other unrelated document, it must be executed separately from any other item included in the invoice or other document which requires the owner, tenant, or operator's signature.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Copies of agreement waiving right to credit or payment.</E> No copies of any agreement waiving a right to credits or payments under section 6420 are to be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service unless a request is made by the Service to the taxpayer for the waivers. Aerial applicators must, however, retain copies of all waivers, and a copy of each waiver must be supplied by the aerial applicator to the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm who waives the right to receive a credit or payment. See regulations § 48.6420-6 for general requirements for records to be kept.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Waiver on behalf of owner, tenant, or operator of farm.</E> An agent of the owner, tenant, or operator of a farm who is expressly authorized to act on behalf of and to bind the owner, tenant, or operator may waive that person's rights to a credit or payment under section 6420 by signing the waiver on the person's behalf.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Sample form of agreement.</E> While no specific form is required for an effective waiver, an acceptable form waiving the right to receive a credit or payment under section 6420 follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>

                <P>I hereby waive my right as owner/tenant/operator of a farm located at ______ (address) ______ to receive credit or payment from the United States for gasoline used by _____ (aerial applicator) ______ on the farm in connection with cultivating the soil, or the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodity. This waiver applies to gasoline used during the period ______ both dates inclusive. I understand that by signing this waiver, I give up my right to claim any credit or payment for gasoline used by the aerial applicator during the period indicated, and I acknowledge that I have not previously claimed any credit for that gasoline.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Every person making a claim for credit or payment under section 6420 must keep records sufficient to enable the district director to determine whether the person is entitled to credit or payment under section 6420 and, if so, the amount of the credit or payment. No particular form is prescribed for keeping the records, but the records must include a copy of the income tax return or claim and a copy of any statement or document submitted with the return or claim. The records must also show with respect to the taxable year covered by the claim—</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable records.</E> (1) Evidence of purchases of gasoline, and the purposes for which it was used, to substantiate claims may include paid duplicate sales invoices or tickets from the gasoline dealer or other vendor, and detailed records of all fuel used which show the amount consumed on a farm for farming purposes and the amount used for other purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) Records maintained for Federal or State income tax purposes, or to support claims for refund of a State tax on gasoline, may be used to the extent that they contain the information necessary to substantiate the accuracy of the claim for credit under section 6420. However, the records must show separately the number of gallons of gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) If trucks or other vehicles are used both on and off the farm, an allocation of gasoline used in the vehicle will be required to show separately the number of gallons of gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes in respect of which the claim is made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Gasoline includible in claim.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Payment may be claimed under section 6420 only in respect of gasoline used on a farm in the United States for farming purposes. No payment is allowable under section 6420 with respect to gasoline used for nonfarming purposes, or gasoline used off a farm, regardless of the nature of such use. If a vehicle or other equipment is used both on a farm and off the farm, or if it is used on a farm both for farming and nonfarming purposes, payment is allowable only with respect to that portion of the gasoline which was “used on a farm for farming purposes” as defined in paragraph (a) of § 48.6420(c)-1. The type of equipment or vehicle and whether or not it is registered for highway use is immaterial. However, the actual use of the equipment or vehicle and place where it is used are material. For example, if a truck used on a farm for farming purposes is also used on the highways (even though in connection with operating the farm), the gasoline used in operating the truck on the highways is not to be taken into account in computing the payment for which a claim is filed, since such gasoline was used off the farm.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) If gasoline is used in a qualified business use or as fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation), a credit (under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section) or a payment (under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section) in respect of the gasoline shall be allowed or made to the ultimate purchaser of the gasoline. For gasoline used in a qualified business use prior to April 1, 1983, the credit or payment under this section shall be an amount equal to 1 cent for each gallon of gasoline so used on which the tax was paid at the rate of 3 cents a gallon, and 2 cents for each gallon of gasoline so used on which the tax was paid at the rate of 4 cents a gallon. For gasoline used in an off-highway business use after March 31, 1983, the credit or payment under this section shall be an amount equal to the amount determined by multiplying the number of gallons so used by the rate at which tax was imposed on such gasoline under section 4081. For gasoline used as a fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation) the credit or payment under this section shall be an amount equal to the amount determined by multiplying the number of gallons so used by the rate at which tax was imposed on the gasoline under section 4081. No interest shall be paid on any payment allowed <PRTPAGE P="240"/>under paragraph (c) of this section. However, interest may be paid on any overpayment (as defined by section 6401) arising from a credit allowed under paragraph (b) of this section. See section 34(a), relating to credit for certain uses of gasoline and special fuels (and lubricating oil used prior to January 7, 1983). See § 48.6421-3 for the time within which a claim for credit or payment must be made under this section. See § 48.6421-4 for the meaning of the terms “gasoline,” “qualified business use,” “noncommercial aviation,” and “taxable year.”</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of determining the allowable credit or payment in respect of gasoline used in a qualified business use or as fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation), gasoline on hand shall be considered used in the order in which it was purchased. Thus, if the ultimate purchaser has on hand gasoline acquired in two purchases made at different times and subject to different rates of tax, in determining credit or payment for the gasoline used in a qualified business use or as fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation), it will be assumed that the gasoline first purchased was the first gasoline used, and the rate applicable to that purchase will apply in determining the credit or payment, until all that gasoline is accounted for.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Allowance of income tax credit in lieu of payment.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, repayment under this section of the tax paid under section 4081 on gasoline used in a qualified business use or as a fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation) by a person subject to income tax may be obtained only by claiming a credit for the amount of this tax against the tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code. The amount of the credit shall be an amount equal to the payment which would be made under section 6421 with respect to gasoline used during the taxable year in a qualified business use or as a fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation) if section 6421(i) and paragraph (c) of this section did not apply. See section 34(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Allowance of payment.</E> Payments in respect of gasoline upon which tax was paid under section 4081 that is used in a qualified business use or as a fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation) shall be made only to—</P>
              <P>(1) The United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an agency or instrumentality of one or more State political subdivisions of a State, or the District of Columbia,</P>
              <P>(2) An organization which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) and is not required to make a return of the income tax imposed under subtitle A for its taxable year, or</P>
              <P>(3) A person described in section 6421(c)(2) to whom $1,000 or more is payable (without regard to paragraph (b) of this section) under this section with respect to gasoline used during any of the first three quarters of the person's taxable year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Dual use of gasoline.</E> (1) No credit or payment may be claimed in respect of gasoline used in a highway vehicle used in a trade or business or for the production of income solely by reason of the fact that the propulsion motor in the vehicle is also used for a purpose other than the propulsion of the vehicle. Thus, if the propulsion motor of a highway vehicle (used in a trade or business or for the production of income) also operates special equipment, such as a mixing unit on a concrete mixer truck or a pump for discharging fuel from a tank truck, by means of a power takeoff or power transfer, no credit or payment may be claimed in respect of the gasoline used to operate the special equipment, even though the special equipment is mounted on the highway vehicle.</P>
              <P>(2) If a highway vehicle is equipped with a separate motor to operate the special equipment used in a trade or business or for the production of income, such as a refrigeration unit, pump, generator, or mixing unit, credit or payment may be claimed in respect of the gasoline used in the separate motor.</P>

              <P>(3) If gasoline used in a separate motor is drawn from the same tank as the one which supplies gasoline for the propulsion of the highway vehicle, the <PRTPAGE P="241"/>determination as to the quantity of gasoline used in the separate motor operating the special equipment must be based on operating experience and supported by records.</P>
              <P>(4) Devices to measure the number of miles the highway vehicle has traveled, such as hubometers, may be used in making a preliminary determination of the number of gallons of gasoline used to propel the vehicle. In order to make a final determination of the number of gallons of gasoline used to propel the vehicle, there must be added to this preliminary determination the number of gallons of gasoline consumed while idling or warming up the motor preparatory to propelling the vehicle.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Gasoline lost or destroyed.</E> Gasoline lost or destroyed through spillage, fire, or other casualty is not considered to have been “used” in a qualified business use or as fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation) and, accordingly, credit or payment in respect of the gasoline may not be claimed.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Supporting evidence required.</E> Each claim under this section for credit or payment must include a statement showing—</P>
              <P>(1) The total number of gallons of gasoline purchased and used during the period covered by the claim in a qualified business use multiplied by the rate of payment allowable in respect of the gasoline. (For the rate of payment allowable, see paragraph (a)(1) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(2) The total number of gallons of gasoline purchased and used during the period covered by the claim for use as fuel in an aircraft (other than aircraft in noncommercial aviation) multiplied by the rate of payment allowable in respect of the gasoline.</P>
              <P>(3) The purpose or purposes for which the gasoline was used, determined by reference to general categories, and the amount used for each purpose; and</P>

              <P>(ii) A claim for payment of a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6421-1(c) or § 48.6421-2(c) must be filed no later than 3 years following the close of its taxable year (see § 48.6421-4).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Quarterly claims.</E> A claim for payment of $1,000 or more in respect of gasoline used during any of the first three quarters of the taxable year, filed either under § 48.6421-1(c)(3) in respect of gasoline used in a qualified business use or as a fuel in an aircraft (other <PRTPAGE P="243"/>than aircraft used in noncommercial aviation) or under § 48.6421-2(c)(3) in respect of gasoline used while engaged in furnishing (for compensation) passenger land transportation available to the general public or in school bus operations, shall not be allowed unless the claim is filed on or before the last day of the first calendar quarter following the calendar quarter for which the claim is filed. No quarterly claim may be filed for the last calendar quarter of the taxable year. Amounts for which payment is disallowed under this paragraph (b)(2) merely because the claim was not filed on time may be included in an annual claim filed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but other amounts for which a claim for payment has been filed under this paragraph (b)(2) may not be included in an annual claim filed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other applicable rules.</E> See § 301.7502-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) for provisions treating timely mailing as timely filing and § 301.7503-1 of this chapter for time for performance of an act where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limit on claims per taxable year.</E> Not more than one claim may be filed under § 48.6421-1 or § 48.6421-2 by any person with respect to gasoline used during any taxable year, except to the extent that quarterly claims may be filed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to any calendar quarter (other than the last calendar quarter) of the taxable year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Form and content of claim</E>—(1) <E T="03">Claim for credit.</E> The claim for credit to which this section applies must be made by attaching a Form 4136 to the income tax return of an individual or a corporation. Form 4136 must be executed in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. A partnership may not file Form 4136. When a partnership files Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of Income, it must include a statement showing how many gallons of gasoline are allocated to each partner and the use made of the gasoline.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Claim for payment.</E> The claim for payment to which this section applies must be made on Form 8849 (or on such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. Each form must designate the taxable year, or calendar quarter, for which it is filed.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Death or termination.</E> (i) If an individual dies, or if a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation is terminated or liquidated, during the taxable year, the claim for credit or payment may be filed in respect of gasoline used during the short taxable year in the same manner as is provided for gasoline used in a full taxable year. Those months which constitute a quarter of a full taxable year will constitute the same quarter of the short taxable year. For example, if a corporation using the calendar year is liquidated on September 30, 1982, and is entitled to $900 under § 48.6421-1 in respect of gasoline used in a qualified business use for the calendar quarters ending June 30 and September 30, it may file a claim for payment in respect of the gasoline used during the calendar quarters ending June 30, and September 30, 1981, and take a credit of $900 on its income tax return for the short taxable year in respect of the gasoline used during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 1982.</P>

              <P>(ii) A claim for payment on behalf of a decedent may be filed by the decedent's executor, administrator, or any other person charged with responsibility for the decedent's affairs. Such a claim must be accompanied by copies of the letters testamentary, letters of administration, or, in the case of a claim filed by other than the executor or administrator, the information called for in Form 1310 (Statement of Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased Taxpayer). The claim may cover only gasoline in respect of which the decedent would have been entitled to claim payment. For example, if an individual dies on July 15, 1982, prior to claiming payment under § 48.6421-1 or $1,000 or more applicable to gasoline purchased and used in a qualified business use during the calendar quarter ending June 30, 1982, the decedent's executor or other legal representative may file a claim for payment covering that calendar quarter, and take the credit provided by section 39(a)(2) against the decedent's income tax on <PRTPAGE P="244"/>the income tax return for the short taxable year in respect of gasoline purchased by the decedent and so used during the period from July 1, 1982 to July 15, 1982, the date of death.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Restrictions on claims for credit or payment.</E> Credits or payments are allowable only in respect of gasoline that was sold by the producer or importer in a transaction that was subject to tax under section 4081. For example, a State or local government may not file a claim with respect to any gasoline which it purchased tax free from the producer, even though the State or local government used the gasoline as a fuel for the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this section. Similarly, a governmental unit or tax-exempt organization that is the ultimate purchaser of gasoline may not file a claim for payment if it is known that another person is entitled to claim credit, payment, or refund with respect to the same gasoline. For example, a State or local government may not file a claim for payment if it has executed, or intends to execute, a written consent, or other documentation, to enable the producer to claim credit or refund for the tax that was paid. See, for example, §§ 48.6416(a)-3 and 48.6416(b)(2)-3(b)(1).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Meaning of terms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>For purposes of the regulations under section 6421, unless otherwise expressly indicated—</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Gasoline.</E> The term “gasoline” has the same meaning given to such term by section 4082(b) and regulations thereunder.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Qualified business use.</E> (1) The term “qualified business use” means any use by a person in a trade or business of the person or in an activity of the person described in section 212 (relating to production of income) otherwise than as a fuel in a highway vehicle—</P>
              <P>(i) That at the time of the use is registered, or is required to be registered, for highway use under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country, or</P>
              <P>(ii) That, in the case of a highway vehicles owned by the United States, is used on the highway.</P>
              <FP>The term “qualified business use” does not include any use in a motorboat, other than a vessel used in the fisheries or whaling business. See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of “highway vehicle.” See paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of “highway.”</FP>
              <P>(2) Any highway vehicle operated under a dealer's tag, license, or permit will be considered to be registered. A highway vehicle is not considered to be “registered” solely because there has been issued a special permit for operation of the vehicle at particular times and under specified conditions. However, a highway vehicle that is required to be registered and that is also issued a special permit for operation of the vehicle under specified conditions, such as carrying an oversize load, is still considered to be “registered.”</P>
              <P>(3) Nonbusiness, off-highway use of gasoline by such vehicles and equipment as minibikes, snowmobiles, power lawn mowers, chain saws, and other yard equipment does not qualify as gasoline used a qualified business use.</P>
              <P>(4) Examples of gasoline used in a qualified business use include:</P>
              <P>(i) Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) in stationary engines to operate pumps, generators, compressors, and power saws;</P>
              <P>(ii) Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) for cleaning purposes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) in forklift trucks, bulldozers, and earthmovers; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Gasoline used by a nonhighway vehicle in connection with the trade or business of construction, mining or logging.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Illustration.</E> The application of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>

                <P>M Corporation, a logging company, files its income tax return on the basis of the calendar year. During 1982, the company used 20,000 gallons of gasoline in its logging business. Of this amount, 12,000 gallons were used as fuel in registered highway vehicles which were operated both on the <PRTPAGE P="245"/>public highways and on the company's private roads. Of the remaining 8,000 gallons, 6,000 were used in nonhighway vehicles, such as tractors and bulldozers, and 2,000 gallons were used in highway vehicles, such as heavy trucks which, at the time of use, were neither registered nor required to be registered under state law for highway use by reason of being operated entirely on the company's property. As the ultimate purchaser, M may take a credit on its income tax return for 1982 under this section in respect of the 6,000 gallons used in the nonhighway vehicles and the 2,000 gallons used in the unregistered highway vehicles. However, no credit may be allowed with respect to the 12,000 gallons used in the registered highway vehicles even though a portion of this gasoline was used in operating the vehicles on the company's own property.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Highway vehicle.</E> The term “highway vehicle” has the same meaning assigned to this term under § 48.4061(a)-1(d).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Highway.</E> The term “highway” includes any road, whether a Federal highway, State highway, city street, or otherwise, in the United States which is not a private roadway.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Noncommercial aviation.</E> The term “non-commercial aviation” has the same meaning given to such term by section 4041(c)(4).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Calendar quarter.</E> The term “calendar quarter” means a period of three calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Taxable year.</E> The “taxable year” of a governmental unit or tax-exempt organization described in § 48.6421-1(c) or § 48.6421-2(c) is the calendar or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books. The “taxable year” of persons subject to income tax shall have the meaning it has under section 7701(a)(23).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Records to be kept in substantiation of credits or payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Every person making a claim for credit or payment under section 6421 must keep records sufficient to enable the district director to determine whether the person is entitled to credit or payment under section 6421 and, if so, the amount of the credit or payment. No particular form is prescribed for keeping the records, but the records must include a copy of any statement or document submitted with the return or claim. The records must also show with respect to the period covered by the claim—</P>
              <P>(1) The number of gallons of gasoline purchased and the dates of purchase,</P>
              <P>(2) The name and address of each vendor from whom gasoline was purchased and the total number of gallons purchased from each,</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable records.</E> (1) Evidence of purchases of gasoline, and the purposes for which it was used, to substantiate claims may include paid duplicate sales invoices or tickets from the gasoline dealer or other vendor, and detailed records of all fuel used which show the amount used for the prescribed purpose and the amount used for other purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) Records maintained for Federal or State income tax purposes, or to support claims for refund of a State tax on gasoline, may be used to the extent that they contain the information necessary to substantiate the accuracy of the claim for credit under section 6421.

              <SUBJECT>Credit or payments to purchaser of special fuels resold or used for nontaxable, farming, or other purposes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount of repayment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Nontaxable or other uses.</E> (i) If tax has been paid under section 4041(a)(1) on the sale of diesel fuel for use as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle or under section 4041(a)(2) on the sale of special motor fuel for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle or a motorboat and the fuel is used by the purchaser for a nontaxable purpose or for a purpose taxable at a lower rate than the purposes for which sold, a credit (under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section) or a payment (under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section) in respect of the fuel shall be allowed or made to the purchaser of the fuel in an amount equal to—</P>
              <P>(A) The amount of the tax imposed on the sale of the fuel to the purchaser if the purchaser resells the fuel, or</P>

              <P>(B) If the purchaser uses the fuel, the amount of tax imposed on the sale of the fuel to the purchaser, less the amount of tax, if any, that would have been imposed on the purchaser's use of <PRTPAGE P="247"/>the fuel if no tax had been imposed on the sale of the fuel to the purchaser.</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and for the regulations under section 6427 applying such paragraph, tax imposed on the sale of fuel will be treated as an overpayment by the purchaser if the person resells the fuel or uses it for a nontaxable purpose or for a purpose taxable at a lower rate than that for which sold to the purchaser. Thus, for example, special motor fuel which was sold tax paid to the purchaser for use otherwise than in a qualified business use in a motor vehicle will qualify for the payment under section 6427 if the purchaser uses it as a fuel in a qualified business use.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Used for farming purposes.</E> (i) If tax has been paid under section 4041(a)(1) on the sale of diesel fuel for use as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle, or under section 4041(a)(2) on the sale of special motor fuel for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle or a motor boat and the fuel is used on a farm for farming purposes, a credit (under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section) or a payment (under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section) in respect of the fuel shall be allowed or made to the purchaser of the fuel in an amount equal to the amount of tax that was imposed under section 4041 on the sale of the fuel. The provisions of section 6420(c) (1), (2), and (3) and § 48.6420-4 shall apply under this paragraph (a)(2) in determining whether the fuel is used on a farm for farming purposes.</P>
              <P>(ii) The term “purchaser,” as used in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, includes only a person who is an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm. A person who is owner, tenant, or operator of a farm is a purchaser of fuel only with respect to such fuel as is purchased by the person and used for farming purposes on a farm of which the person is the owner, tenant, or operator. Thus, the owner of a farm who purchases fuel which is used on the farm by its owner, tenant, or operator for farming purposes is generally the purchaser of the fuel. If, however, the cost of fuel supplied by an owner, tenant, or operator of a farm, is by agreement or other arrangement borne by a second person who is an owner, tenant, or operator of the farm, the second person who bore the cost of the fuel is considered to be the purchaser of the fuel.</P>
              <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, if fuel is used on a farm by any person other than the owner, tenant, or operator for the purposes described in section 6420(c)(3)(A) and § 48.6420-4(d) (relating to gasoline used in cultivating, raising, or harvesting), the owner, tenant, or operator (as the case may be) will be treated for the purposes of § 48.6427-1(a)(2)(i) as the purchaser who used the fuel on the farm for farming purposes.</P>
              <P>(iv) Section 6427(c) provides that an aerial applicator or other applicator is entitled to be treated as the user and ultimate purchaser of fuel that the applicator uses on a farm for the purposes described in section 6420(c)(3)(A), but only if the owner, tenant, or operator of the farm who is otherwise entitled to be treated as the ultimate purchaser waives the right to credit or payment. The rules contained in section 6420 and the regulations under the section regarding waivers by owners, tenants, and operators of farms of their rights to payments under section 6420 for gasoline used by aerial applicators on a farm for farming purposes apply to waivers under this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Definitions, uses, and other rules.</E> (i) No interest shall be paid on any payment allowed under paragraph (c) of this section. However, interest may be paid on any overpayment (as defined by section 6401) arising from a credit. See section 34(a), relating to credit for certain uses of gasoline and special fuels. See section 39(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 prior to its revision by the Highway Revenue Act of 1982, relating to credit for certain uses of lubricating oil. See section 6611, relating to interest on overpayments.</P>
              <P>(ii) See § 48.6427-3 for the time within which a claim for credit or payment must be made under this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) See § 48.6420-4 for the meaning of the terms “used on a farm for farming purposes” and “farm.” The term “gasoline” has the same meaning given to this term by section 4082(b) and the regulations thereunder. For the meaning of the terms “diesel fuel,” “special <PRTPAGE P="248"/>motor fuel,” “motor vehicle,” “highway vehicle,” and “registered” see section 4041 and the regulations thereunder. The term “fuel” means diesel fuel, special motor fuel, or gasoline, as the context requires. Where appropriate, the term “use” includes a resale. See § 48.6421-4 for the meaning of “calendar quarter” and “taxable year”.</P>
              <P>(iv) For purposes of determining the allowable credit or payment in respect of fuel used for nontaxable purposes, on a farm for farming purposes, or for purposes taxable at a lower rate, fuel on hand shall be considered used in the order in which it was purchased. Thus, if the purchaser made purchases at different times and subject to different rates of tax, then in determining credit or payment for fuel used for a described purpose, it will be assumed that the fuel first purchased was the first fuel used, and the rate applicable to that purchase will apply in determining the credit of payment, until all of that fuel is accounted for.</P>
              <P>(v) Fuel lost or destroyed through spillage, fire, or other casualty is not considered to have been “used” within the meaning of this section, and, accordingly, no credit or payment of the tax paid on the sale of the fuel may be made under this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Allowance of income tax credit in lieu of payment.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, repayment under this section of the tax paid under section 4041 on fuel used by a person subject to income tax may be obtained only by claiming a credit for the amount of this tax against the tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code. The amount of the credit shall be an amount equal to the payment which would be made under section 6427 with respect to fuel used during the taxable year for nontaxable purposes on a farm for farming purposes, or for purposes taxable at a lower rate, if section 6427(i) and paragraph (c) of this section did not apply. See section 34(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Allowance of payment.</E> Payments in respect of fuel upon which tax was paid under section 4041 that is used for nontaxable purposes, on a farm for farming purposes, or for purposes taxable at a lower rate, shall be made only to—</P>
              <P>(1) The United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an agency or instrumentality of one or more States or political subdivisions of a State, or the District of Columbia,</P>

              <P>(3) In the case of fuel used for nontaxable purposes to which section 6427(a) applies, to a person described in section 6427(g)(2) to whom $1,000 or more is payable (without regard to paragraph (b) of this section) under this section with respect to fuel used during any of the first three quarters of his taxable year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Dual use of fuel.</E> The principles set forth in § 48.4041-7, relating to dual use of fuel, for determining whether liability is incurred under section 4041 at the time of sale of the fuel, are equally applicable in determining whether a credit or payment is to be allowed under this section. Thus, if diesel fuel or special motor fuel used in a separate motor is drawn from the same tank as the one which supplies fuel for the propulsion of the vehicle, a reasonable determination of the quantity of the fuel used in the separate motor will be acceptable for purposes of computing the payment or credit under this section. The determination must be based, however, on the operating experience of the person using the fuel, and a statement, signed by the person, evidencing the operating experience must be maintained as a part of the records of the person claiming the payment or credit.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Supporting evidence required.</E> Each claim under this section for credit or payment must include a statement showing—</P>
              <P>(1) The total number of gallons of fuel purchased and used for nontaxable or farming purposes during the period covered by the claim, multiplied by the rate of payment allowable under this section with respect to such fuel;</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 48.6427-3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Time for filing claim for credit or payment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A claim for credit or payment described in § 48.6427-1 with respect to fuel used for nontaxable, farming, or other purposes taxable at a lower rate or in § 48.6427-2 with respect to fuel used either in an intercity or local bus while engaged in furnishing (for compensation) passenger land transportation available to the general public or in school bus transportation operations shall cover only fuel used during the taxable year, or when paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, used during the calendar quarter. Therefore, fuel on hand at the end of a taxable year, or, if applicable, a calendar quarter, such as fuel in supply tanks of vehicles or in storage tanks or drums, must be excluded from a claim filed for the taxable year or calendar quarter, as the case may be. However, this fuel may be included in a claim filed for a later taxable year or a later calendar quarter if it is used during that later year or quarter for nontaxable or farming purposes, or in an intercity or local bus while engaged in furnishing (for compensation) passenger land transportation available to the general public or in school bus transportation operations. Fuel used during the taxable year or calendar quarter may be covered by the claim for that period although the fuel has not been paid for at the time the claim is filed. The purposes of applying this section, a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6427-1(c) or § 48.6427-2(c) is considered to have as its taxable year the calendar year or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books; see § 48.6421-4.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time for filing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Annual claims.</E> (i) A claim under this section for credit or payment with respect to fuel used during a taxable year shall not be allowed unless it is filed no later than the time prescribed by section 6511 and the regulations thereunder for filing a claim for credit or refund of income tax for the particular taxable year.</P>
              <P>(ii) A claim for payment of a governmental unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6427-1(c) or unit or exempt organization described in § 48.6427-2(c), must be filed no later than 3 years following the close of its taxable year. See § 48.6421-4.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Quarterly claims.</E> A claim for payment of $1,000 or more in respect to fuel used during any of the first three quarters of the taxable year, filed either under § 48.6427-1(c)(3) in respect of fuel used for nontaxable purposes or for purposes taxable at a lower rate, or under § 48.6427-2(c)(3) in respect of fuel used while engaged in furnishing (for compensation) passenger land transportation available to the general public or in school bus transportation operations, shall not be allowed unless the claim is filed on or before the last <PRTPAGE P="251"/>day of the first calendar quarter following the calendar quarter for which the claim is filed. No quarterly claim may be filed for the last calendar quarter of the taxable year. Amounts for which payment is disallowed under this paragraph (b)(2) merely because the claim was not filed on time may be included in an annual claim filed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but other amounts for which a claim for payment has been filed under this paragraph (b)(2) may not be included in an annual claim filed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other applicable rules.</E> See § 301.7502-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) for provisions treating timely mailing as timely filing and § 301.7503-1 of this chapter for time for performance of an act where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limit on claims per taxable year.</E> Not more than one claim may be filed under § 48.6427-1 or § 48.6427-2 by any person with respect to fuel used during any taxable year, except to the extent that quarterly claims may be filed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to any calendar quarter (other than the last calendar quarter) of the taxable year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Form and content of claim</E>—(1) <E T="03">Claim for credit.</E> The claim for credit to which this section applies must be made by attaching a Form 4136, to the income tax return of an individual or a corporation. Form 4136 must be executed in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. A partnership may not file Form 4136. When a partnership files Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of Income, it must include a statement showing how many gallons of fuel are allocated to each partner and the use made of the fuel.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Claim for payment.</E> The claim for payment to which this section applies must be made on Form 8849 (or on such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions prescribed for the preparation of the form. Each form must designate the taxable year, or calendar quarter, for which it is filed.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Death or termination.</E> (i) If an individual dies, or if a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation is terminated or liquidated, during the taxable year, the claim for credit or payment may be filed in respect of fuel used during the short taxable year in the same manner as is provided for fuel used in a full taxable year. Those months which constitute a quarter of a full taxable year will constitute the same quarter of the short taxable year. For example, if a corporation using the calendar year is liquidated on September 30, 1982, and is entitled to $900 under § 48.6427-1 in respect of fuel used for nontaxable purposes for the calendar quarter ending March 31 and is also entitled to payments of $1,500 for each of the calendar quarters ending June 30 and September 30, it may file a claim for payment in respect of the fuel used for nontaxable purposes during the calendar quarters ending June 30, and September 30, 1982, and take a credit of $900 on its income tax return for the short taxable year in respect of the fuel used during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 1982.</P>
              <P>(ii) A claim for payment on behalf of a decedent may be filed by the decedent's executor, administrator, or any other person charged with responsibility for the decedent's affairs. Such a claim must be accompanied by copies of the letters testamentary, letters of administration, or, in the case of a claim filed by other than the executor or administrator, the information called for in Form 1310 (Statement of Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased Taxpayer).</P>

              <P>The claim may cover only fuel in respect of which the decedent would have been entitled to claim payments. For example, if an individual dies on July 15, 1982, prior to claiming payment under § 48.6427-1 of $1,000 or more applicable to fuel purchased and used for nontaxable purposes during the calendar quarter ending June 30, 1982, the decedent's executor or other legal representative may file a claim for payment covering that calendar quarter, and take the credit provided by section 39(a)(3) against the decedent's income tax on the income tax return for the short taxable year in respect of fuel purchased by the decedent and so used during the period from July 1, 1982, to July 15, 1982, the date of death.<PRTPAGE P="252"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Restrictions on claims for credit or payment.</E> Credits or payments are allowable only in respect of fuel that was sold by the producer or importer in a transaction that was subject to tax under section 4041. For example, a State or local government may not file a claim with respect to any fuel which it purchased tax free from the producer, even though the State or local government used the fuel for the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this section. Similarly, a State or local government may not file a claim with respect to the use of fuel if it is known that another person is entitled to claim a payment, credit, or refund with respect to the same fuel. For example, a State or local government may not file a claim in respect of tax-paid fuel that has been resold by the purchaser to the State or local government.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Limitation on amount of credit or refund</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of fuel sold or used after July 31, 1984, on which tax was imposed under section 4041(a), the amount of credit or refund under section 6427(b)(1) shall not exceed 12 cents per gallon except where fuel is used in a bus while such bus is being operated as a “qualified local bus” in which case the credit or refund shall be the full amount of tax paid under section 4041(a) on such fuel.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Qualified local bus.</E> A bus is considered to be operated as a “qualified local bus” if such bus—</P>
              <P>(i) Is engaged in furnishing (for compensation) intracity passenger land transportation that is available to the general public and is scheduled and along regular routes,</P>
              <P>(ii) Has a seating capacity of at least 20 adults (not including the driver), and</P>
              <P>(iii) Is under contract with (or is receiving more than a nominal subsidy from) any State or local government (as defined in section 4221(d)(4)) to furnish such transportation.</P>
              <FP>A company that operates qualified local buses is eligible for a full refund or credit only with respect to fuel used while such buses are operating as qualified local buses. For example, a company that operates its buses along subsidized intracity routes and also on intercity or unsubsidized intracity routes may obtain a full refund or credit only with respect to fuel used while operating the subsidized intracity routes.</FP>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This section provides rules under which ultimate purchasers of taxed diesel fuel and kerosene may claim the income tax credits or payments allowed by section 6427(l). Generally, these claims relate to diesel fuel and kerosene used in nontaxable uses. Claims relating to diesel fuel and kerosene sold for use on a farm for farming purposes and by a State are made by registered ultimate vendors under § 48.6427-9; claims relating to kerosene sold from a blocked pump are made by registered ultimate vendors (blocked pump) under § 48.6427-10; and claims relating to kerosene sold during certain periods of extreme cold for blending with diesel fuel to be used for heating purposes are made by registered ultimate vendors (blending) under § 48.6427-11.<PRTPAGE P="254"/>

              <P>(i) Tax was imposed by section 4081 on the diesel fuel or kerosene to which the claim relates;</P>
              <P>(ii) The claimant produced or bought the diesel fuel or kerosene and did not sell it in the United States;</P>
              <P>(iii) The claimant has filed a timely claim for a credit or payment that contains the information required under paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iv) The diesel fuel or kerosene was not bought under a certificate described in § 48.6427-9(e)(2) (relating to Certificate of Farming Use or State Use);</P>
              <P>(v) The diesel fuel or kerosene was not used on a farm for farming purposes (as defined in § 48.6420-4) or by a State;</P>
              <P>(vi) With respect to kerosene, the kerosene was not sold from a blocked pump or sold for blending with diesel fuel under the conditions described in § 48.6427-11; and</P>
              <P>(vii) The diesel fuel or kerosene was either—</P>
              <P>(A) Used in a use described in § 48.4082-4(c)(3) through (c)(8);</P>
              <P>(B) Exported;</P>
              <P>(C) Used other than as a fuel in a propulsion engine of a diesel-powered highway vehicle; or</P>
              <P>(D) Used as a fuel in the propulsion engine of a diesel-powered bus if the bus was engaged in a use described in section 6427(b)(1) (after the application of section 6427(b)(3)).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b).
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>(i) In September 2000, F bought 250 gallons of undyed diesel fuel. In October 2000, F used 200 gallons of the fuel in a farm tractor. This use qualifies as use on a farm for farming purposes (as defined in § 48.6420-4). The farm tractor is not a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in § 48.4081-1(b)). F used the remaining 50 gallons to heat F's residence. F filed a complete and timely claim for a credit relating to the 250 gallons.</P>
                <P>(ii) A credit or payment is not allowable to F with respect to the 200 gallons of diesel fuel used in the farm tractor. Even though this fuel was used other than as a fuel in a propulsion engine of a diesel-powered highway vehicle (thus meeting the condition in paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(C) of this section), the condition in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is not satisfied because the fuel was used on a farm for farming purposes.</P>
                <P>(iii) A credit is allowable to F with respect to the 50 gallons F used for heating purposes because the conditions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been met. F used this fuel other than as a fuel in a propulsion engine of a diesel-powered highway vehicle and the use of the fuel for residential heating is not use on a farm for farming purposes.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>(i) In September 2000, W, a wholesale distributor, sold 3,500 gallons of diesel fuel on which tax has been imposed to C, a construction company located in the United States. W's selling price to C did not include an amount equal to the federal excise tax on the fuel. C used the fuel other than as a fuel in a propulsion engine of a diesel-powered highway vehicle. Both W and C file a complete and timely claim for a credit relating to the fuel.</P>
                <P>(ii) Because W resold the fuel in the United States, the condition of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is not met. Thus, W is not allowed a credit or payment with respect to the fuel.</P>
                <P>(iii) C is eligible for a credit or payment with respect to the fuel because the conditions to allowance in paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been met. The conditions to allowance do not include a requirement that C buy the fuel at a price that includes the amount of the tax.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prepaid telephone cards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of communications services acquired by means of a prepaid telephone card (PTC), the face amount of the PTC is treated as an amount paid for communications services and that amount is treated as paid when the PTC is transferred by any carrier to any person that is not a carrier. This section provides rules for the application of the section 4251 tax to PTCs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to this section:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Carrier</E> means a telecommunications carrier as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Comparable PTC</E> means a currently available dollar card or tariffed unit card (other than a PTC transferred in bulk or under special circumstances, such as for promotional purposes) that provides the same type and amount of communications services as the PTC to which it is being compared.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Dollar card</E> means a PTC the value of which is designated by the carrier in dollars (even if also designated in units of service), provided that the designated value is not less than the amount for which the PTC is expected to be sold to a holder.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Holder</E> means a person that purchases other than for resale.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Prepaid telephone card (PTC)</E> means a card or similar arrangement that permits its holder to obtain a fixed amount of communications services by means of a code (such as a personal identification number (PIN)) or other access device provided by the carrier and to pay for those services in advance.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Tariff</E> means a schedule of rates and regulations filed by a carrier with the Federal Communications Commission.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Tariffed unit card</E> means a unit card that is transferred by a carrier—</P>
              <P>(1) To a holder at a price that does not exceed the designated number of units on the PTC multiplied by the carrier's tariffed price per unit; or</P>
              <P>(2) To a transferee reseller subject to a contractual or other arrangement under which the price at which the PTC is sold to a holder will not exceed the designated number of units on the PTC multiplied by the carrier's tariffed price per unit.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Transferee</E> means the first person that is not a carrier to whom a PTC is transferred by a carrier.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Transferee reseller</E> means a transferee that purchases a PTC for resale.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Unit card</E> means a PTC other than a dollar card.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Untariffed unit card</E> means a unit card other than a tariffed unit card.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of face amount</E>—(1) <E T="03">Dollar card.</E> The face amount of a dollar card is the designated dollar value.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Tariffed unit card.</E> The face amount of a tariffed unit card is the designated number of units on the PTC <PRTPAGE P="263"/>multiplied by the tariffed price per unit.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Untariffed unit card</E>—(i) <E T="03">Transfer to holder.</E> The face amount of an untariffed unit card transferred by a carrier to a holder is the amount for which the carrier sells the PTC to the holder.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Transfer to transferee reseller</E>—(A) <E T="03">In general.</E> The face amount of an untariffed unit card transferred by a carrier to a transferee reseller is at the option of the carrier—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The highest amount for which the carrier sells a PTC that provides the same type and amount of communications services to a holder that ordinarily would not be expected to buy more than one such PTC at a time (if the carrier makes such sales on a regular and arm's-length basis) or the face amount of a comparable PTC (if the carrier does not make such sales on a regular and arm's-length basis);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) 135 percent of the amount for which the carrier sells the PTC to the transferee reseller (including in that amount, in addition to any sum certain fixed at the time of the sale, any contingent amount per unit multiplied by the designated number of units on the PTC); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If the PTC is of a type that ordinarily is used entirely for domestic communications service, the maximum number of minutes of domestic communications service on the PTC multiplied by the applicable rate.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Applicable rate.</E> The applicable rate under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section with respect to a PTC is $0.30 reduced (but not below $0.20) by $0.01 for each full 20 minutes by which the maximum number of minutes of domestic communications service on the PTC exceeds 40 minutes.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Sales not at arm's length.</E> In the case of a transfer of an untariffed unit card by a carrier to a transferee reseller otherwise than through an arm's-length transaction, the fair market retail value of the PTC shall be substituted for the amount determined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Exclusion.</E> The amount of any state or local tax imposed on the furnishing or sale of communications services that is separately stated in the bill or on the face of the PTC and the amount of any section 4251 tax separately stated in the bill or on the face of the PTC are disregarded in determining, for purposes of this paragraph (c), the amount for which a PTC is sold.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Liability for tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Under section 4251(d), the section 4251(a) tax is imposed on the transfer of a PTC by a carrier to a transferee. The person liable for the tax is the transferee. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the person responsible for collecting the tax is the carrier transferring the PTC to the transferee. If a holder purchases a PTC from a transferee reseller, the amount the holder pays for the PTC is not treated as an amount paid for communications services and thus tax is not imposed on that payment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of statement that purchaser is a carrier</E>—(i) <E T="03">On transferor.</E> A carrier that transfers a PTC to a purchaser is not responsible for collecting the tax if, at the time of transfer, the transferor carrier has received written notification from the purchaser that the purchaser is a carrier, and the transferor has no reason to believe otherwise. The notification to be provided by the purchaser is a statement, signed under penalties of perjury by a person with authority to bind the purchaser, that the purchaser is a carrier (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). The statement is not required to take any particular form.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">On purchaser.</E> If a purchaser that is not a carrier provides the notification described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to the carrier that transfers a PTC, the purchaser remains liable for the tax imposed on the transfer of the PTC.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> Any exemptions available under section 4253 apply to the transfer of a PTC from a carrier to a holder. Section 4253 does not apply to the transfer of a PTC from a carrier to a transferee reseller.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1. Unit card; sold to individual.</HD>

                <P>(i) On May 1, 2000, A, a carrier, sells a card it calls a prepaid telephone card at A's retail <PRTPAGE P="264"/>store to P, an individual, for P's use in making telephone calls. A provides P with a PIN. The value of the card is not denominated in dollars, but the face of the card is marked 30 minutes. The sales price is $9. A tariff has not been filed for the minutes on the card. The toll telephone service acquired by purchasing the card will be obtained by entering the PIN and the telephone number to be called.</P>
                <P>(ii) Because P purchased from a carrier other than for resale, P is a holder. The card provides its holder, P, with a fixed amount of communications services (30 minutes of toll telephone service) to be obtained by means of a PIN, for which P pays in advance of obtaining service; therefore, the card is a PTC. Because the value of the PTC is not designated in dollars and a tariff has not been filed for the minutes on the PTC, the PTC is an untariffed unit card. Because it is transferred by the carrier to the holder, the face amount is the sales price ($9).</P>
                <P>(iii) The card is a PTC; thus, under section 4251(d), the face amount is treated as an amount paid for communications services and that amount is treated as paid when the PTC is transferred from A to P. Accordingly, at the time of transfer, P is liable for the 3 percent tax imposed by section 4251(a). The amount of the tax is $0.27 (3% × the $9 face amount). Thus, the total paid by P is $9.27, the $9 sales price plus $0.27 tax. A is responsible for collecting the tax from P.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2. Unit card; given to individual.</HD>
                <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 1,</E> except that instead of selling a card, A gives a 30 minute card to P.</P>
                <P>(ii) Although the card provides P with a fixed amount of communications services (30 minutes of toll telephone service) to be obtained by means of a PIN, P does not pay for the service. Therefore, the card is not a PTC, even though it is called a prepaid telephone card by A.</P>
                <P>(iii) Because the card is not a PTC, section 4251(d) does not apply. Furthermore, no tax is imposed by section 4251(a) because no amount is paid for the communications services.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3. Unit card; adding value.</HD>
                <P>(i) After using the card described in <E T="03">Example 2,</E> P arranges with A by telephone to have 30 minutes of toll telephone service added to the card. The sales price is $9. P is told to continue using the PIN provided with the card.</P>
                <P>(ii) Because P purchased from a carrier other than for resale, P is a holder. The arrangement provides its holder, P, with a fixed amount of communications services (30 minutes of toll telephone service) to be obtained by means of a PIN, for which P pays in advance of obtaining service; therefore, the arrangement is a PTC. Because the value of the PTC is not designated in dollars and a tariff has not been filed for the minutes on the PTC, the PTC is an untariffed unit card. Because it is transferred by the carrier to the holder, the face amount is the sales price ($9).</P>
                <P>(iii) The arrangement is a PTC; thus, under section 4251(d), the face amount is treated as an amount paid for communications services and that amount is treated as paid when the PTC is transferred from A to P. Accordingly, at the time of transfer, P is liable for the 3 percent tax imposed by section 4251(a). The amount of the tax is $0.27 (3% × the $9 face amount). Thus, the total paid by P is $9.27, the $9 sales price plus $0.27 tax. A is responsible for collecting the tax from P.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4. Dollar card; sold other than for resale.</HD>
                <P>(i) On May 1, 2000, B, a carrier, sells 100,000 cards it calls prepaid telephone cards to Q, an auto dealer, for $50,000. Q will give away a card to each person that visits Q's dealership. B provides Q with a PIN for each card. The face of each card is marked $3. The toll telephone service acquired by purchasing the card will be obtained by entering the PIN and the telephone number to be called.</P>
                <P>(ii) Because Q purchased from a carrier other than for resale, Q is a holder. Each card provides its holder, Q, with a fixed amount of communications services ($3 of toll telephone service) to be obtained by means of a PIN, for which Q pays in advance of obtaining service; therefore, each card is a PTC even though Q's visitors do not pay for the cards. The value of each PTC is designated in dollars; therefore, each PTC is a dollar card. Because the PTC is a dollar card, the face amount is the designated dollar value ($3).</P>
                <P>(iii) The cards are PTCs; thus, under section 4251(d), the face amount is treated as an amount paid for communications services and that amount is treated as paid when the PTCs are transferred from B to Q. Accordingly, at the time of transfer, Q is liable for the 3 percent tax imposed by section 4251(a). The amount of the tax is $9,000 (3% × the $3 face amount × 100,000 PTCs). Thus, the total paid by Q is $59,000, the $50,000 sales price plus $9,000 tax. B is responsible for collecting the tax from Q.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 5. Tariffed unit card; sold to transferee reseller.</HD>

                <P>(i) On May 1, 2000, C, a carrier, sells 1,000 cards it calls prepaid telephone cards to R, a convenience store owner, for $7,000. C provides R with a PIN for each card. The value of the cards is not denominated in dollars, but the face of each card is marked 30 minutes and a tariff of $0.33 per minute has been filed for the minutes on each card. R agrees that it will sell the cards to individuals for their own use and at a price that does not exceed $0.33 per minute. R actually sells the cards for $9 each (that is, at a price equivalent to $0.30 per minute). The toll telephone service acquired by purchasing the card will be obtained by entering the PIN and the telephone number to be called.<PRTPAGE P="265"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Because R purchased from a carrier for resale, R is a transferee reseller. Because R's customers will purchase other than for resale, they will be holders. Each card sold by R provides its holder, R's customer, with a fixed amount of communications services (30 minutes of toll telephone service) to be obtained by means of a PIN provided by the carrier, for which R's customer pays in advance of obtaining service; therefore, each card is a PTC. Because the value of each PTC is not designated in dollars and C sells the PTCs to R subject to an arrangement under which the price at which the PTCs are sold to holders will not exceed the designated number of minutes on the PTC multiplied by C's tariffed price per minute, each PTC is a tariffed unit card. Because the PTCs are tariffed unit cards, the face amount of each PTC is $9.90, the designated number of minutes on the PTC multiplied by the tariffed price per minute (30 × $0.33), even though the retail sale price of each card is $9.</P>
                <P>(iii) The cards are PTCs; thus, under section 4251(d), the face amount is treated as an amount paid for communications services and that amount is treated as paid when the PTC is transferred from C to R. Accordingly, at the time of transfer, R is liable for the 3 percent tax imposed by section 4251(a). The amount of the tax is $297 (3% × the $9.90 face amount × 1,000 PTCs). Thus, the total paid by R is $7,297, the $7,000 sales price plus $297 tax. C is responsible for collecting the tax from R.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 6. Unit card; sold to transferee reseller.</HD>
                <P>(i) On May 1, 2000, D, a carrier, sells 10,000 cards it calls prepaid telephone cards to S, a convenience store owner, for $60,000. D provides S with a PIN for each card. The value of the cards is not denominated in dollars, but the face of each card is marked 30 minutes. A tariff has not been filed for the minutes on each card. S will sell the cards to individuals for their own use for $9 each. D also sells a card that provides 30 minutes of the same type of communications service at its retail store for $9. The toll telephone service acquired by purchasing the card will be obtained by entering the PIN and the telephone number to be called.</P>
                <P>(ii) Because S purchased from a carrier for resale, S is a transferee reseller. Because S's customers will purchase other than for resale, they will be holders. Each card sold by S provides its holder, S's customer, with a fixed amount of communications services (30 minutes of toll telephone service) to be obtained by means of a PIN provided by the carrier, for which S's customer pays in advance of obtaining service; therefore, each card is a PTC. Because the value of each PTC is not designated in dollars and a tariff has not been filed for the minutes on the PTC, each PTC is an untariffed unit card.</P>

                <P>(iii) The PTCs are untariffed unit cards transferred by the carrier to a transferee reseller. Thus, the face amount is determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, which permits D to choose from three alternative methods. Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, the face amount of each PTC would be $9, the highest amount for which D sells to holders purchasing a single PTC. Alternatively, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, the face amount of each PTC would be $8.10, computed as follows: 135% × the $60,000 sales price ÷ 10,000 PTC's. Finally, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section (assuming the PTCs are of a type that ordinarily is used entirely for domestic communications services), the face amount of each PTC would be $9 ($0.30 × 30 minutes).</P>

                <P>(iv) The cards are PTCs; thus, under section 4251(d), the face amount is treated as an amount paid for communications services and that amount is treated as paid when the PTCs are transferred from D to S. Accordingly, at the time of transfer, S is liable for the 3 percent tax imposed by section 4251(a). Assuming that D chooses to determine the face amount as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, the amount of the tax is $2,430 (3% × the $8.10 face amount × 10,000 PTCs). Thus, the total paid by S is $62,430, the $60,000 sales price plus $2,430 tax. D is responsible for collecting the tax from S.</P>

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 7. Transfer of card that is not a PTC.</HD>
                <P>(i) On May 1, 2000, E, a carrier, provides a telephone card to T, an individual, for T's use in making telephone calls. E provides T with a PIN. The card provides access to an unlimited amount of communications services. E charges T $0.25 per minute of service, and bills T monthly for services used. The communications services acquired by using the card will be obtained by entering the PIN and the telephone number to be called.</P>
                <P>(ii) Although the communications services will be obtained by means of a PIN, T does not receive a fixed amount of communications services. Also, T cannot pay in advance since the amount of T's payment obligation depends upon the number of minutes used. Therefore, the card is not a PTC.</P>
                <P>(iii) Because the card is not a PTC, section 4251(d) does not apply. However, the 3 percent tax imposed by section 4251(a) applies to the amounts paid by T to E for the communications services. Accordingly, at the time an amount is paid for communications services, T is liable for tax. E is responsible for collecting the tax from T.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Toll telephone service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “toll telephone service” means any telephone or radio telephone message or conversation for which there is a toll charge, and the charge is paid within the United States. A toll charge is a charge made for such a message or conversation to a place beyond the local service area. For the meaning of the term “United States”, see paragraph (d) of § 49.4252-4.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amounts paid.</E> (1) The tax in respect of toll telephone service is imposed on the total amount paid for the service, including any charge, in addition to the basic toll charge, made for “overtime” in connection with a telephone or radio telephone message or conversation.</P>
              <P>(2) The tax attaches to the total charge made to a hotel or similar subscriber for toll telephone service furnished to the hotel or its guests, but no tax attaches to any charge made by the hotel for service rendered in placing the calls for its guests.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cross reference.</E> For provisions relating to toll telephone messages communicated through the use of coin-operated telephones, see section 4253(a) and § 49.4253-1. For other provisions relating to toll telephone service, see § 49.4252-4.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Provisions common to telephone and telegraph services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax applies to all amounts paid for services rendered which are incidental to the transmission of a message or conversation. Where dispatches, messages, or conversations are transmitted by telephone, radio telephone, telegraph, cable, or radio free of any charge whatsoever, no tax attaches, but where the carrier in fact makes some charge for the transmission, either in money, service, or other valuable consideration, such charge is subject to the tax upon the basis of the amount of the charge computed in money or money's worth. The tax is payable by the person paying the transmission charge and is to be collected by the person receiving the payment. If a message, dispatch, or conversation is transmitted “collect”, the person who pays the charge therefor is liable for the tax. All telephone and telegraph transmission services when rendered for hire are subject to tax whether or not the agency furnishing such services is a common carrier. For provisions relating to the computation of tax with respect to charges for telephone and telegraph services, see section 4254 and §§ 49.4254-1 and 49.4254-2.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When transmission begins and ends.</E> Transmission begins when the message is delivered by the sender to the carrier, or its agent, and continues until receipt by the addressee or his agent. Thus, an amount paid to a telephone, telegraph, radio, or cable company for messenger service in bringing the recipient of a message to the telephone, or in delivering a dispatch or message, must be included in determining the total amount subject to tax. However, an amount paid for messenger service rendered by a hotel or similar establishment is not to be included in the total charge on which the tax is computed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Services rendered under contract.</E> (1) Except as an exemption may otherwise be specifically provided for in this part, where, under the provisions of a contract, dispatches, messages, or conversations are transmitted by telephone, radio telephone, telegraph, cable, or radio in consideration of the payment of a lump sum of money or the performance of services, the amounts paid for such transmissions are subject to tax regardless of whether such dispatches, messages, or conversations relate to the operation of the business of a common carrier and whether they are “on line” or “off line”.</P>
              <P>(2) Where a telegraph company agrees to transmit over its wires dispatches or messages relating to the business of a carrier free or at reduced rates in consideration of services to be performed by the carrier in transporting men or materials of the telegraph company, all such dispatches or messages are subject to tax.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Meaning of the term “United States”.</E> For purpose of section 4252 (b) <PRTPAGE P="267"/>and (c), the term “United States” includes the States and the District of Columbia. Such term also includes inland waters (such as rivers, lakes, bays, etc.) lying wholly within the United States, and, where an international boundary line divides inland waters, such parts of such inland waters as lie within the boundary of the United States, and also the waters known as a marine league from low tide on the coast line. Ships within these limits whether of foreign or domestic registry are considered to be within the United States.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> For exemptions from the taxes imposed on amounts paid for telephone and telegraph services, see sections 4253, 4292, 4293, and 4294, and the regulations thereunder contained in this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Teletypewriter exchange service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “teletypewriter exchange service” means any service where a teletypewriter (or similar device) may be connected, directly or indirectly, to an exchange operated by a person engaged in the business of furnishing communication service, if by means of such connection communication may be established with any other teletypewriter (or similar device). If the teletypewriter or similar device used in conjunction with such service may be connected to such an exchange, the service constitutes teletypewriter exchange service whether or not it is the practice of the subscriber to the service to make such connection, and whether or not the person engaged in the business of furnishing communication service permits the subscriber to make such connection.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amounts paid.</E> In determining the amount of tax due, the amount paid for the service shall include all charges made in connection with the furnishing of any teletypewriter exchange service, such as salaries of operators, if in the employ of the person furnishing such service, charges for equipment, instruments, and other apparatus. In cases where a person leases lines or channels, equipment, and other facilities used in conjunction with teletypewriter exchange service, the amounts paid by such person for such lines or channels, equipment, and other facilities constitute amounts paid for teletypewriter exchange service, notwithstanding the fact that the lines or channels, equipment, and other facilities used in conjunction with such service are supplied by different persons or in part by the user of such service.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> For exemptions from the tax imposed on amounts paid for teletypewriter exchange service, see sections 4253, 4292, 4293, and 4294, and the regulations thereunder contained in this part.</P>

The tax imposed on amounts paid for toll telephone service or telegraph service is not applicable to a single telephone conversation for which a tool charge is made (see paragraph (a) of § 49.4252-2), or to a telegraph message, if the charge for such toll telephone service (including any additional charge for overtime) or telegraph service is less than 25 cents and is paid for by inserting coins in a public coin-operated telephone.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception where service furnished for a guaranteed amount.</E> Where a coin-operated telephone service is furnished for a guaranteed amount, the amount paid under such guarantee plus any fixed monthly or other periodic charge is subject to the tax imposed on amounts paid for general telephone service. The tax applies to the full amount of the guarantee whether such amount is paid out of receipts from the coin-box of the telephone or from funds of the subscriber.</P>

A line or channel connects stations between which there would otherwise be a toll charge if the telephone company makes a toll charge for a single message transmitted between the two stations in the case of the ordinary residential and business or commercial telephone service. A line or channel connecting two stations is considered a continuous line or channel if such line or channel does not connect with any switchboard interposed between the two stations, which makes it possible to carry on two or more independent conversations simultaneously.

The term “trade or business” as used in this section includes activities of organizations which are conducted with no purpose of gain or profit. A line or channel is considered to be furnished between specified locations only when the line or channel connects preselected points without the use of switching functions performed by a communications company exchange. Where an amount is paid which includes a charge for such a line or channel and also a charge for the service provided by means of switching functions performed by a communications company exchange, the exemption is applicable only to that portion of the amount so paid as is attributable to such a line or channel. The preselected points must be located in different States or in different counties or municipalities of the same State. If the preselected points are located in a State in which the political subdivisions are not denominated as counties or municipalities, then the preselected points must be in different political subdivisions of such State which correspond to counties or municipalities. For purposes of this paragraph the term “municipality” means the largest political subdivision of a State below the level of county or similar subdivision.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Transportation beginning before November 16, 1962.</E> Section 4261 imposes a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount paid for taxable transportation of persons by rail, motor vehicle, water, or air which begins before November 16, 1962. For the definition of the term “taxable transportation”, see section 4262 and §§ 49.4262(a)-1 and 49.4262 (b)-1. The tax accrues at the time payment is made for the transportation, irrespective of when the transportation is furnished if the transportation actually begins before November 16, 1962.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Transportation beginning after November 15, 1962.</E> Section 4261 imposes a tax equal to 5 percent of the amount paid for the air portion of taxable transportation of persons which begins after November 15, 1962, and before July 1, 1965. For definition of the term “taxable transportation”, see section 4262 and §§ 49.4262(a)-1 and 49.4262 (b)-1. The tax accrues at the time payment is made for the transportation, irrespective of when the transportation is furnished if the transportation actually begins after November 15, 1962, and before July 1, 1965.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">In general.</E> The purpose of the transportation, whether business or pleasure, is immaterial. It is not necessary that the transportation be between two definite points. If not otherwise exempt, a payment for continuous transportation beginning and ending at the same point is subject to the tax. For the rate of tax with respect to amounts paid for seating and sleeping <PRTPAGE P="272"/>accommodations in connection with taxable transportation, see § 49.4261-9.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application of tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Tax on total amount paid.</E> The tax is measured by the total amount paid, whether paid at one time or collected at intervals during the course of a continuous transportation, as in the case of a carrier operating under the zone system. For the application of the tax with respect to amount paid for seating or sleeping accommodations in connection with taxable transportation, see § 49.4261-9.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tax on transportation of each person.</E> The tax is determined by the amount paid for transportation with respect to each person. Thus, where a single payment is made for the transportation of two or more persons, the taxability of the payment and the amount of the tax, if any, payable with respect thereto, must be determined on the basis of the portion of the total payment properly allocable to each person transported.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Charges for nontransportation services.</E> Where a payment covers charges for nontransportation services as well as for transportation of a person, such as charges for meals, hotel accommodations, etc., the charges for the nontransportation services may be excluded in computing the tax payable with respect to such payment, provided such charges are separable and are shown in the exact amounts thereof in the records pertaining to the transportation charge. If the charges for nontransportation services are not separable from the charge for transportatinon of the person, the tax must be computed upon the full amount of the payment.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Transportation beginning and ending in the United States or the 225-mile zone.</E> The tax imposed by section 4261(a) applies to payments made within the United States for transportation which begins in the United States or in the 225-mile zone and ends in the United States or in the 225-mile zone. For example, an amount paid within the United States for transportation between New York and Montreal, Canada; between Vancouver, Canada, and Windsor, Canada; or between Nogales, Mexico, and Hermosillo, Mexico, would be fully taxable. See section 4262(c) (2) and paragraph (b) of § 49.4262(c)-1 for the definition of the term “225-mile zone”.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other transportation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Transportation beginning before November 16, 1962.</E> In the case of transportation beginning before November 15, 1962, (other than that described in paragraph (a) of this section), for which payment is made in the United States, the tax applies with respect to the amount paid for that portion of such transportation which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States. Transportation that (i) begins in the United States or in the 225-mile zone and ends outside such area, (ii) begins outside the United States or the 225-mile zone and ends inside such area, or (iii) begins outside the United States and ends outside such area is taxable only with respect to such portion of the transportation which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another such port or station. Thus, on a trip from Chicago to London, England, with a stopover at New York, for which payment is made in the United States, the tax would apply to the part of the payment which is applicable to the transportation from Chicago to New York.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Transportation beginning after November 15, 1962.</E> In the case of transportation beginning after November 15, 1962 (other than that described in paragraph (a) of this section), for which payment is made in the United States, the tax applies with respect to the amount paid for that portion of such transportation by air which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States, but only if such portion is not a part of “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section <PRTPAGE P="273"/>4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1. Transportation that</P>
              <P>(i) Begins in the United States or the 225-mile zone and ends outside such area,</P>
              <P>(ii) Begins outside the United States or the 225-mile zone and ends inside such area, or</P>
              <P>(iii) Begins outside the United States and ends outside such area.</P>
              <FP>is taxable only with respect to such portion of the transportation by air which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States, but only if such portion is not a part of “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1. Thus, on a trip by air from Chicago to London, England, with a stopover at New York, for which payment is made in the United States, if the portion from Chicago to New York is not a part of “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section 4262(c)(3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1, the tax would apply to the part of the payment which is applicable to the transportation from Chicago to New York. However, if the portion from Chicago to New York is a part of “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1, the tax would not apply.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Method of computing tax on taxable portion.</E> Where a payment is made for transportation which is partially taxable under paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The tax may be computed on that proportin of the total amount paid which the mileage of the taxable portion of the transportation bears to the mileage of the entire trip, or</P>
              <P>(2) The tax may be computed on the basis of the applicable local fare for transportation of a like class between the ports or stations referred to in paragraph (b) of this section. Where a uniform fare is charge for transportation between a station and any coastal gateway point of embarkation on a trip to the same international destination, the tax may be computed on the basis of such uniform fare. In the absence of a fare described in this subparagraph, the tax must be determined in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. If an international trip includes a leg between coastal gateway points of embarkation for which no additional fare is charged, no tax shall be applicable to such leg of the transportation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payments made within the United States; evidence of nontaxability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Presumption of taxability.</E> The tax imposed by section 4261(a) shall apply to any amount paid within the United States for the transportation of any person, unless the taxpayer establishes in accordance with the provisions of this section that at the time of payment the transportation is not transportation in respect of which tax is imposed by section 4261(a) (see section 4264(d)).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Through tickets.</E> In the case of transportation which is wholly or in part not taxable transportation, the issuance of one ticket (commonly known as a “through ticket”) covering such transportation will be sufficient to establish that the amount paid for such transportation is wholly or in part not subject to tax. Thus, if A purchases a through ticket in the United States for transportation by air which begins before November 16, 1962, from Chicago to Edmonton, Canada, with a stopover in Minneapolis, no further evidence will be required to establish that no tax applies with respect to the amount paid for the portion of transportation between Minneapolis and Edmonton. A similar result will be reached if a through ticket is purchased for the same air transportation which begins after November 15, 1962, and the trip is not “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1.

              </P>

The agency or carrier which receives the payment for the domestic ticket or order shall inscribe the tickets or orders for the entire journey in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) The international ticket or order shall be inscribed or stamped with an appropriate legend (for example, “Cannot be reused to obtain any tax exemption on a domestic ticket or order”) to show that a domestic ticket or order has been purchased wholly or partially tax free for use in conjunction therewith.</P>
              <P>(2) The domestic ticket or order shall be inscribed to show (i) the identity of the agency or carrier which received payment therefor (unless otherwise shown on the ticket or order), (ii) the origin and destination of the additional transportation, (iii) the identify of the carrier furnishing the additional transportation, and (iv) the serial number of the ticket or order covering such additional transportation. If the domestic ticket or order is not large enough to accommodate the prescribed inscription, a statement setting forth the required information shall be attached to such ticket or order.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Tickets issued for uninterrupted international air transportation.</E> All tickets issued for “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1, whether through tickets or separate tickets, must have inscribed thereon, in addition to the other information required in the regulations in this subpart, sufficient information from which may be ascertained the scheduled arrival and departure time at each stopover to which the six-hour scheduled interval requirement of section 4262(c)(3) applies. It will be sufficient, for example, if the airline ticket or tickets show the trip number and the date and time of departure of the aircraft from each such stopover point, provided the published airline schedules show the scheduled time of arrival at each such stopover point.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax does not apply to a payment made outside the United States for transportation which begins or ends outside the United States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payment made outside the United States for transportation between two or more points within the United States (such transportation being referred to hereinafter in this section as “the United States portion”), which is part of transportation from or to a point outside the United States is a payment for transportation which begins or ends outside the United States, where it is definitely established at the time of making payment for the United States portion that such portion is purchased for use in making the journey from or to a point outside the United States.

He purchases in Havana a ticket for his transportation by water from Havana to Miami, and later purchases from a travel agency in Havana air transportation from Miami to New York for which the travel agency issues an exchange order. To establish the nontaxable character of the payment for Z's transportation from Miami to New York the travel agency shall determine at the time payment is received by it that the transportation is being purchased for use in conjunction with the connecting transportation from Havana to Miami, and shall make the appropriate inscription on the ticket and the order. The carrier which accepts the exchange order and issues the ticket for the transportation from Miami to New York will not be required to collect tax with respect to the ticket so issued if it appropriately inscribes the ticket as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Examples of payments subject to tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following are examples of payments for transportation which, unless otherwise exempt under section 4263, 4292, 4293, or 4294 are subject to tax:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Cash fares.</E> The tax applies to payments of so-called “cash fares” where no ticket or other evidence of the right to transportation is issued to the passenger.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Script books.</E> The tax applies to the amounts paid for scrip books. The tax shall be collected from the purchaser at the time the scrip book is sold, and not when and as the scrip is used for transportation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional charges.</E> Amounts paid as additional charges for changing the class of accommodations, changing the destination or route, extending the time limit of a ticket, as “extra fare”, or for exclusive occupancy of a section, etc., are subject to the tax.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Round-trip tickets.</E> An amount of 61 cents or more paid for a round-trip ticket is taxable (1) if the one-way fare of like class is 61 cents or more, or (2) if there is no established one-way fare of like class.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Commutation or season tickets.</E> (1) Amounts paid for commutation or season tickets good for more than one <PRTPAGE P="277"/>month are subject to tax where the single trip is 30 miles or more. For this purpose the term “30 miles” means 30 constructive miles where the rate for transportation is fixed on the constructive mileage. The tax shall be collected from the purchaser at the time of payment for the commutation or season ticket, and not when and as the ticket is used for transportation.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that a partly used exempt commutation or season ticket is redeemed and the carrier, in determining the amount of the refund, makes a charge at regular rates for the used portion of the ticket, the tax applies to such charge, if the one-way fare is more than 60 cents.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Prepaid orders, exchange orders, or similar orders.</E> The tax applies to the amounts paid for prepaid orders, exchange orders, or similar orders for transportation. Additional amounts paid in procuring transportation in connection with the use of prepaid orders, exchange orders, or similar orders, are likewise subject to tax.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Combinations of rail, motor vehicle, water, or air transportation.</E> The tax applies to the total amount paid for transportation over the lines of a number of connecting carriers; and also with respect to transportation beginning before November 16, 1962, to the total amount paid for any combination of rail, motor vehicle, water, or air transportation, such as rail-air line, air line-motor bus, or motor bus-steamship, etc. For transportation beginning after November 15, 1962, the tax will apply only to the amount paid for any portion of such transportation that is by air.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Chartered conveyances</E> (1) An amount paid for the charter.</P>
              <P>(i) Of a special car, train, motor vehicle, aircraft, or boat for transportation which begins before November 16, 1962, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Of an aircraft for transportation which begins after November 15, 1962, provided no charge is made by the charterer to the persons transported, is subject to tax if the amount paid for the charter represents a per capita charge of more than 60 cents for each person actually transported.</P>
              <P>(2) The charterer of a conveyance who sells transportation to other persons must collect and account for the tax with respect to all amounts paid to him for transportation which are in excess of 60 cents. In such case, no tax will be due on the amount paid for the charter of the conveyance but it shall be the duty of the owner of the conveyance to advise the charterer of his liability for collecting and accounting for the tax.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">All-expense tours.</E> Amounts paid for all-expense tours are subject to tax with respect to that portion representing transportation which is subject to tax. See paragraph (c) of § 49.4261-2 and paragraph (f) (4) of § 49.4261-8.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Payments remitted to foreign countries by persons in the United States.</E> Payments for transportation tickets, prepaid orders, exchange orders, or similar orders are subject to the tax where the payment for such tickets or orders is accomplished by the purchaser either (1) by transmission from within the United States via telegraph or mail of cash, checks, postal or telegraphic money orders, and similar drafts to ticket offices or travel agencies, etc., located in any place without the United States, or (2) by the delivery of the funds to an agency located in the United States for transmission to ticket offices, or travel agencies, etc., without the United States. Such payments are considered to be payments made within the United States.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Special baggage transportation equipment.</E> An amount paid for special baggage transportation equipment is not subject to the tax on the transportation of persons if separable from the payment for transportation of persons and if shown in the exact amount of the charge on the records covering the taxable transportation payment.</P>

However, if the contract payment also covers the issuance to advance agents, bill posters, etc., of circus or show scrip books, or other evidence of the right to transportation, for use on regular passenger conveyances, that portion of the contract payment properly allocable to such scrip books or other evidence is subject to the tax on the transportation of persons.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Corpses.</E> The tax on the transportation of persons does not apply to the amount paid for the transportation of a corpse, but does apply to the amount paid for the transportation of any person accompanying the corpse.</P>

              <P>(3) Charges for bridge or road toll, or a ferry charge of 60 cents or less, made in connection with the transportation beginning before November 16, 1962, of a person by bus. Charges incurred by the carrier which are part of its costs of operation, such as bridge tolls, road tolls, or ferry charges, paid by the carrier on account of the bus and driver, cannot be deducted from the charge made to the passenger in determining the taxable charges for transportation.</P>
              <P>(4) Charges for admissions, guides, meals, hotel accommodations, and other nontransportation services, for example, where such items are included in a lump sum payment for an all-expense tour.</P>
              <P>(5) Charges in connection with the charter of a land, water, or air conveyance for the transportation of persons beginning before November 16, 1962, or an air conveyance for transportation of persons which begins after November 15, 1962, such as for parking, icing, sanitation, “layover” or “waiting time”, movement of equipment in deadhead service, dockage, or wharfage, etc.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Taxable transportation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Unless excluded under section 4262(b) (see § 49.4262(b)-1), taxable transportation means:</P>
              <P>(1) Transportation which begins in the United States or in that portion of Canada or Mexico which is not more than 225 miles from the nearest point in the continental United States (the “225-mile zone”) and ends in the United States or in the 225-mile zone; and</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of any other transportation, that portion of such transportation which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States, but, with respect to transportation which begins after November 15, 1962, only if such portion is not part of “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1. Transportation from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States occurs whenever a carrier, after leaving any port or station in the United States, makes a regularly scheduled stop at another port or station in the United States irrespective of whether stopovers are permitted or whether passengers disembark.</P>
              <FP>The provisions of this paragraph are applicable whether the transportation is by rail, motor vehicle, water, or air, or any combination thereof, except that with respect to transportation which begins after November 15, 1962, the tax, if applicable, applies only to the amount paid for that portion of the transportation which is by air.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Illustrations of taxable transportation under section</E> 4262(a) (1). In each of the following examples the transportation is taxable transportation and the amount paid within the United States for such transportation is subject to the tax:</P>
              <P>(1) New York to Seattle;</P>
              <P>(2) New York to Vancouver, Canada, with a stop at Jasper, Canada;</P>
              <P>(3) Chicago to Monterrey, Mexico;</P>
              <P>(4) Montreal, Canada, to Toronto, Canada; and</P>
              <P>(5) Miami to Los Angeles via Panama. If in the examples in subparagraphs (1) and (5) of this paragraph, payment for the transportation had been made outside the United States, such payment would nevertheless have been subject to tax since in each case the transportation begins and ends in the United States.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Illustrations of taxable transportation under section 4262(a) (2) beginning before November 16, 1962.</E> The following examples will illustrate the application of section 4262(a) (2) with respect to transportation beginning before November 16, 1962:

                <P>B purchases a ticket in San Francisco for combination rail and water transportation from San Francisco to New York to Halifax, Canada, to London, England. The amount paid for that part of the transportation between San Francisco and New York is subject to tax, since such transportation is from one station in the United States to another station in the United States. Although Halifax is in the 225-mile zone, the transportation between New York and Halifax is not taxable because it is not transportation from one port in the United States to another port in the United States.</P>

                <P>A purchases in New York a round-trip ticket for transportation by air from New York to Nassau with a scheduled stopover of 10 hours in Miami on both the going and return trip. The amount paid for that part of the transportation from New York to Miami on the going trip is subject to tax, since such transportation is from one station in the United States to another station in the United States and the trip is not uninterrupted international air transportation because the scheduled stopover interval in Miami is greater than six hours. The amount paid for the return trip from Miami to New York is subject to tax for the same reason.</P>

                <P>A purchases a ticket in San Francisco for transportation to London with a stopover in New York. He is to travel by air from San Francisco to New York and from New York to London by water. He is scheduled to stopover in New York for 4 hours. That portion of the total amount paid by A for his transportation applicable to the air transportation between San Francisco and New York is subject to tax since such transportation is from one station in the United States to another station in the United States, and is not a part of uninterrupted international air transportation since the complete trip from San Francisco to London is not entirely by air.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (3).</HD>
                <P>A purchases a through ticket for air transportation from San Francisco to London with stopovers at Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York. At each stopover the air carrier has scheduled his arrival and departure within 6 hours. After arriving in Philadelphia, A, for his own convenience, decides to stopover for more than 6 hours. The total amount paid by A for his transportation from San Francisco to New York is subject to tax since the scheduled interval between the beginning or end and the end or beginning of any two segments of the domestic portion of international air transportation exceeded 6 hours. If the stopover interval in Philadelphia is extended for more than 6 hours by the carrier solely for its own convenience such as making repairs to the aircraft, the domestic portion of A's trip will not become taxable, provided A continues his international air transportation no later than on the first available flight offered by the carrier.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (4).</HD>
                <P>A purchases a through ticket for transportation by air from Los Angeles to Barbados with stopovers at Houston, Mexico City, Mexico, and Miami. At each stopover, except Mexico City, A's scheduled time of arrival and departure is within six hours. At Mexico City, A's scheduled time of arrival and departure exceeds six hours. The total amount paid by A for his transportation from Los Angeles to Miami, including that part of the transportation to and from Mexico City, is subject to tax since the transportation includes a portion which is indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States (Houston to Miami via Mexico City) and the scheduled interval in Mexico City between two segments of such portion exceeds six hours. If A's scheduled arrival and departure at each stopover of his transportation which is directly or indirectly between ports or stations in the United States, including that at Mexico City, had been within a six hour interval and A had arrived and departed at each such stopover within that period, the transportation would have qualified as uninterrupted international air transportation and no part of the amount paid for the transportation by air from Los Angeles to Barbados would be subject to tax.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Illustrations of transportation which is not taxable transportation.</E> The following examples will illustrate transportation which is not taxable transportation:</P>
              <P>(1) New York to Trinidad with no intervening stops;</P>
              <P>(2) Minneapolis to Edmonton, Canada, with a stop at Winnipeg, Canada;</P>
              <P>(3) Los Angeles to Mexico City, Mexico, with stops at Tia Juana and Guadalajara, Mexico;</P>
              <P>(4) New York to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada, after November 15, 1962, by air with a scheduled stopover in Chicago of five hours.</P>

              <FP>Amounts paid for the transportation referred to in examples set forth in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph are not subject to the tax regardless of where payment is made, since none of the trips (i) begin in the United States or in the 225-mile zone and end in the United States or in the 225-mile zone, nor (ii) contain a portion <PRTPAGE P="281"/>of transportation which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States. The amount paid within the United States for the transportation referred to in the example set forth in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph is not subject to tax since the entire trip (including the domestic portion thereof) is “uninterrupted international air transportation” within the meaning of section 4262(c) (3) and paragraph (c) of § 49.4262(c)-1. In the event the transportation is paid for outside the United States, no tax is due since the transportation does not begin and end in the United States.</FP>

If the taxable transportation includes a leg from a station to a coastal gateway point of embarkation for which a uniform fare is charged regardless of the gateway point actually used, the tax on such a leg may be computed on the basis of such uniform fare. In the absence of a fare described in this subparagraph, the tax must be determined in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">The continental United States.</E> For purposes of the regulations in this subpart, the term “continental United States” includes only the 48 States existing on July 25, 1956 (the date of the enactment of the Act of July 25, 1956 (Pub. L. 796, 84th Cong., 70 Stat. 644)) and the District of Columbia, including inland waters (such as rivers, lakes, bays, etc.) lying wholly therein, and, where an international boundary line divides inland waters, such parts of such inland waters as lie within the boundary of the United States, and also the waters 3 nautical miles (3.45 statute miles) from low tide on the coast line. For purposes of the regulations in this subpart, the term “continental United States” does not include Alaska or Hawaii for any period either prior or subsequent to their admission into the Union as States.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The 225-mile zone.</E> For purposes of the regulations in this subpart, the term “225-mile zone” means that portion of Canada and Mexico which is not more than 225 miles from the nearest point in the continental United States. Whether any point in Canada or Mexico is more than 225 miles from the continental United States is to be determined by measuring the distance from such point to the nearest point on the boundary of the continental United States.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Uninterrupted International air transportation.</E> (1) For the purpose of the regulations in this subpart, the term “uninterrupted international air transportation” means transportation entirely by air which does not begin in <PRTPAGE P="283"/>the United States or in the 225-mile zone and end in the United States or in the 225-mile zone provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) Where the transportation within the United States involves one stop, the scheduled interval between the beginning or end of the United States portion of such air transportation and the end or beginning of the remainder of the air transportation, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the United States portion of such transportation involves two or more stops, the scheduled interval between the beginning or end of one segment and the end or beginning of the continuing segment of such portion does not exceed six hours. The transportation is considered to be entirely by air even though the passenger may use other means of transportation between two airports provided the scheduled six-hour limitation for his continuing air transportation is complied with. Transportation which otherwise is uninterrupted international air transportation does not cease to be such because of the use of non-air transportation between ports or stations which are outside the United States, provided the non-air transportation is not part of transportation which is indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the interval between arrival and departure time at any stopover point in the United States exceeds six hours, such transportation is not uninterrupted international air transportation even though the schedules of the air lines do not make possible a scheduling within the six-hour limit. Where any interval scheduled for six hours or less is increased to exceed six hours, the transportation will continue to be uninterrupted international air transportation if the increase in time is attributable to delays in the arrival or departure of the scheduled air transportation. In such case the transportation shall continue to be uninterrupted international air transportation if the passenger continues his transportation no later than on the first available flight offered by the continuing carrier which affords the passenger substantially the same accommodations as originally purchased. However, if for any other reason such interval at any stopover is increased to more than 6 hours, the transportation will lose its classification of uninterrupted international air transportation. The tax applicable in such case shall be paid as provided in paragraph (a) (2) of § 49.4264(c)-1. The transportation from the point of orgin in the United States to a port or station outside the United States and the 225-mile zone, with a stopover in the United States, must be scheduled before the time the initial transportation commences in order for the United States portion of such transportation to qualify as uninterrupted international air transportation. For example, where transportation by air from Chicago to New York only is scheduled in Chicago and transportation by air from New York to London, England, is scheduled by the passenger after his arrival in New York, the Chicago to New York trip does not qualify as uninterrupted international air transportation even though the passenger may depart on the London flight within six hours after arrival in New York.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Amounts paid for the transportation of persons on a small aircraft of the type sometimes referred to as “air taxis” shall be exempt from the tax imposed under section 4261 provided the aircraft (1) has a gross take-off weight of less than 12,500 pounds determined as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and (2) has a passenger seating capacity of less than 10 adult passengers, including the pilot. The exemption does not apply, however, if the aircraft is operated on an established line.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of gross take-off weight.</E> The term “gross take-off weight of less than 12,500 pounds” means a maximum certificated take-off weight of less than 12,500 pounds. This shall be based on the maximum certificated take-off weight shown in the aircraft operating record or aircraft flight <PRTPAGE P="284"/>manual which is part of the air worthiness certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Established line.</E> The term “operated on an established line” means operated with some degree of regularity between definite points. It does not necessarily mean that strict regularity of schedule is maintained; that the full run is always made; that a particular route is followed; or that intermediate stops are restricted. The term implies that the person rendering the service maintains and exercises control over the direction, route, time, number of passengers carried, etc.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Special rule for collection of tax.</E> Section 4264(b) provides a special rule for the collection of the tax where an unused ticket or order (or portion thereof) purchased without payment of tax is presented for refund and, as a result of the use of only a portion of the transportation purchased in connection with such ticket or order, liability for payment of tax has been incurred. In such a case, the person making the refund shall deduct the amount of the tax due, to the extent available, from the amount which would otherwise be refundable. If the redemption value of the unused ticket or order (or portion thereof) is less than the amount of the tax due on the amount paid for the travel actually performed, the person redeeming the unused ticket or order (or portion thereof) shall make no refund but shall apply the entire amount against the tax due and shall collect any additional tax due or, within 90 days, shall make a report of the amount of the tax remaining uncollected, together with the name and address of the person who sought the refund. The report shall be made to the office of the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the person making such report is located, and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the person presenting the unused ticket or order for redemption.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Return of tax.</E> Any person who has made a collection of tax in accordance with the preceding paragraph shall include such amount in his regular return of taxes required to be collected under section 4291.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Illustration.</E> A carrier receives for redemption a ticket purchased in the United States for transportation from Calgary, Canada, to Edmonton, Canada, which the purchaser bought for use in conjunction with a ticket for nonstop transportation from Seattle to Calgary. The person applying for the refund does not establish to the satisfaction of the carrier that the tax on the Seattle-Calgary ticket has been paid or that the Seattle-Calgary ticket has been redeemed. The carrier, before making any refund for the unused ticket, is required to deduct from the amount otherwise refundable the tax applicable to the amount paid by the purchaser for the transportation from Seattle to Calgary and to report the tax so collected in its quarterly return of Form 720. In the event that the redemption value of the unused Calgary to Edmonton ticket is less than the amount of the tax due on the amount paid for the transportation from Seattle to Calgary, the carrier should not make any refund but should apply against the outstanding tax the entire amount refundable and should either collect the balance of the tax due or make a report, within 90 days, to the office of the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the carrier is located, setting forth the name and address of the person seeking the refund and the amount of the tax remaining uncollected.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Rule</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, when any tax imposed by section 4261 is not paid at the time payment for the transportation is made, then to the extent that such tax is not collected under any other provision of law, such tax shall be paid by the person paying for the transportation or by the person using the transportation. The provisions of section 4264(c) apply where the amount paid for transportation is (i) subject to tax at the time such payment is made, but no tax is paid at that time, or (ii) not subject to tax at the time such payment is made, but because of some subsequent event the payment becomes subject to tax. The payment of tax shall be made to the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the taxpayer resides, or to the person from whom the transportation was purchased, within 30 days after whichever of the following first occurs: (<E T="03">a</E>) The rights to the transportation expire, or (<E T="03">b</E>) the transportation becomes subject to tax.

The payment of the tax shall be made to the air carrier which provides the next continuing portion of the transportation following the occurrence of the event which caused the transportation to cease to be uninterrupted international air transportation and such carrier shall collect the tax at the time the flight is rescheduled or before furnishing the continuing transportation to the passenger, whichever is earlier, unless the carrier has evidence, in writing, that the tax has already been paid to (i) a district director, or (ii) the person to whom the payment for the international air transportation was originally made, or (iii) any person furnishing any portion of such transportation. The provisions of this subparagraph with respect to the responsibility of the continuing carrier to collect the tax due are applicable only if the passenger uses his original ticket or is issued a substitute therefor for the purpose of continuing his transportation. Such provisions are not applicable if the passenger purchases a new ticket to continue his transportation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Relationship to other sections.</E> Section 4264(c) and this section are not intended in any way to relieve the person receiving the payment for taxable transportation of persons from his duty under section 4291 of collecting the tax at the time such payment is received by him. The provisions of section 4264(c) and this section also do not apply in any case where the tax is collected in the manner provided in section 4264 (a) or (b) or in other provisions of law.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of the regulations in this subpart, a round trip shall be considered to consist of two separate trips, i.e., one trip from the point of departure to the destination and a second trip in returning from the destination. A round trip includes certain journeys in which the same routing is not followed on the return trip from the destination to the point of departure as was taken on the going trip (sometimes referred to as “circle trips”). In the case of a cruise or tour (i.e., transportation to no set destination but with one or more intermediate stops en route) the point farthest from the point of departure will be regarded as the destination for purposes of applying the term “round trip”. If a cruise or tour ends at a point other than the one at which it began, the rules of “open jaw” transportation set forth in paragraph (b) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Open jaw transportation.</E> Transportation which qualifies under this paragraph as “open jaw” transportation will be treated in the same manner as a round trip. For purposes of the regulations in this subpart, “open jaw” transportation means (1) transportation from the point of departure to a specified destination and return from the specified destination to a point other than the original point of departure, or (2) transportation from the point of departure to a specified destination and return from a point other than the specified destination to the original point of departure, provided that where the points of the open jaw are within the continental United States or the 225-mile zone, the distance between the points of the open jaw does not exceed the distance of the shorter segment traveled. For example, a trip from New York to New Orleans via Panama would be considered as one trip from New York to Panama and separate trip from Panama to New Orleans, since the distance between the points of the open jaw (i.e., New York and New Orleans) is shorter than the distance between Panama and New Orleans (the shorter of the two segments traveled). Both trips would be nontaxable. On the other hand, transportation from New York to Miami via Bermuda does not qualify as “open jaw” transportation (since the points of the open jaw are in the United States and the distance between them is greater than the shorter segment traveled) and therefore would be considered a single trip from New York to Miami and would be taxable.</P>

Thus, an amount paid for transportation from New York to San Francisco with a stop at Caracas, Venezuela, will be considered an amount paid for a trip from <PRTPAGE P="287"/>New York to Caracas and for a separate trip from Caracas to San Francisco, neither of which is taxable transportation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Transportation beginning before November 16, 1962, by water on a vessel</E>—(1) <E T="03">Special rule.</E> Section 4264(f)(2) prior to its amendment by section 5(b) of the Tax Rate Extension Act of 1962 provided a special rule in the case of transportation which begins before November 16, 1962, any part of which is outside the northern portion of the Western Hemisphere, by water on a vessel which makes one or more intermediate stops at ports within the United States on a voyage which (i) begins or ends in the United States, and (ii) ends or begins outside the northern portion of the Western Hemisphere. In such a case, a stop at an intermediate port within the United States at which such vessel is not authorized both to discharge and to take on passengers shall not be considered to be a stop at a port within the United States. A vessel is considered to be authorized both to discharge and to take on passengers at an intermediate port unless there is a legal or other authoritative prohibition of such traffic. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an order issued by the owner or operator of a vessel prohibiting such vessel from either discharging or taking on passengers at the intermediate port is not a legal or other authoritative prohibition of such traffic.</P>

The vessel on which A sails makes an intermediate stop during the course of such voyage at Boston to take on passengers. The vessel is not, however, authorized to discharge passengers at such port. No tax applies to the portion of the transportation between New York and Boston since under section 4264(f)(2) the vessel is not considered to have made a stop at Boston.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tax on transportation of property by air.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose of this section.</E> In general, section 4271 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, imposes a tax equal to 5 percent of the amount paid within or without the United States for the transportation of property by air which begins after June 30, 1970, if such transportation begins and ends in the United States. This section sets forth rules as to the general applicability of the tax. This section also sets forth rules as authorized by section 4272(b)(2) which exempt from tax payments for the transportation of property by air in the course of exportation (including shipment to a possession of the United States) by continuous movement, and in due course so exported.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Imposition of tax.</E> (1) The tax imposed by section 4271 applies only to amounts paid to persons engaged in the business of transporting property by air for hire.</P>

              <P>(2) The tax imposed by section 4271 does not apply to amounts paid for the transportation of property by air if such transportation is furnished on an <PRTPAGE P="288"/>aircraft having a maximum certificated takeoff weight (as defined in section 4492(b)) of 6,000 pounds or less, unless such aircraft is operated on an established line. The tax imposed by section 4271 also does not apply to any payment made by one member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 4282(b)) to another member of such group for services furnished in connection with the use of an aircraft if such aircraft is owned or leased by a member of the affiliated group and is not available for hire by persons who are not members of such group.</P>
              <P>(3) Since the tax imposed by section 4271 applies only to amounts paid to persons engaged in the business of transporting property by air for hire, the tax applies to amounts paid to an air carrier by a freight forwarder or express company for the transportation of property by air. The tax does not apply to amounts paid by a shipper to a freight forwarder or express company.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Property exported or imported entirely by air.</E> (1) The tax does not apply to amounts paid for transportation entirely by air which begins in the United States and ends outside the United States, or which begins outside the United States and ends in the United States. Transportation of property by air will be considered to begin and end at the points of origin and destination shown on a through airwaybill covering shipment of the property, even though there may be stopovers in the United States (such as, for example, to consolidate cargo at a “gateway” city). If a through airwaybill is issued by a person other than a person engaged in the business of transporting property by air for hire (for example, by a freight forwarder), the air carrier may accept an air freight manifest listing the article to be shipped by weight and destination as evidence of the existence of a through airwaybill.</P>
              <P>(2) If a through airwaybill covering air transportation from its beginning in the United States to a foreign destination, or from its beginning abroad to a U.S. destination, has not been issued, then the export or import character of the shipment must be evidenced by a contract or other written evidence clearly showing the beginning point and ending point of the air transportation.</P>
              <P>(3) If a through airwaybill has been issued covering air transportation to a foreign destination, but the transportation nevertheless ends in the United States (for example, because the foreign consignee cancels the order before the shipment leaves a gateway city), then the amount paid for air transportation is taxable. In such a case the air carrier must collect the tax from the shipper or other person who paid for the air transportation.</P>
              <P>(4) Any transportation of property by air shipped by the Department of Defense through an aerial port of embarkation and debarkation on a U.S. Government bill of lading shall be considered to:</P>
              <P>(i) Begin in the United States and end outside the United States if the bill of lading states that the shipment is “For Export”, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Begin outside the United States and end in the United States if the bill of lading states that the shipment is “Imported by Air”.</P>
              <FP>If a U.S. Government bill of lading stating that a shipment is “For Export” has been issued but the shipment nevertheless ends in the United States, then the amount paid for air transportation is taxable. In such a case the Department of Defense shall notify the air carrier that the shipment is taxable and shall pay the tax to such carrier.</FP>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exportation involving two or more modes of transportation.</E> (1) Even though transportation of property by air begins and ends in the United States, the tax does not apply if the property is being transported in the course of exportation by continuous movement and in due course is so exported, provided the requirements of this paragraph are satisfied. For example, the tax does not apply to air transportation from Chicago to New York if the property is in the course of exportation, by continuous movement, by boat from New York to Europe and in due course is so exported. Delays caused by circumstances beyond the control of the shipper (such as labor disputes or natural disasters) will not interrupt continuous movement. Property arriving at a gateway city by air may be repacked or consolidated with other <PRTPAGE P="289"/>property without interrupting continuous movement.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) Continuous movement in the course of exportation shall be evidenced by (<E T="03">a</E>) the execution of the Export Exemption Certificate, Form 1363, and (<E T="03">b</E>) proof that exportation has actually occurred.</P>
              <P>(ii) Form 1363 may be used in connection with a separate payment otherwise subject to tax or it may be used, with the permission of the district director, as a blanket exemption certificate by a person who expects to make payments for numerous export shipments over an indefinite period of time. If used in connection with a separate payment, the certificate shall be executed, in duplicate, by the shipper or other person making the payment subject to tax. Such person shall retain the duplicate with the shipping papers for at least 3 years from the last day of the month during which the shipment was made from the point of origin, and shall file the original with the carrier at the time of payment of the transportation charge. The carrier receiving the original certificate shall retain it along with the document showing payment of the transportation charge, for a period of at least 3 years from the last day of the month during which the shipment was made from the point of origin.</P>
              <P>(iii) Form 1363 may be used as a blanket exemption certificate by a person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district director that it is impracticable to execute a separate Form 1363 for each payment. Permission to execute a blanket exemption certificate shall be requested, in writing, from the district director for the district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the shipper or other person seeking permission. If permission is granted a separate certificate shall be executed in duplicate, by the shipper or other person making the payments, for each air carrier to be used in making export shipments. Such person shall retain the duplicate together with all shipping papers, and shall file the original with the air carrier with or before payment of the first transportation charge to be covered by the certificate. The air carrier shall retain the original certificate together with all documents showing payment of the transportation charges. Permission to execute a blanket exemption certificate if granted, shall remain in force until withdrawn by the person who requested such permission or until withdrawn by the district director who granted such permission. Each person shall retain the certificate for at least 3 years after the last day of the month during which the final shipment covered by the certificate was made from the point of origin. Each person shall retain the shipping and payment documents for at least 3 years after the last day of the month during which the shipment was made from the point of origin.</P>
              <P>(3) The filing of a properly executed Form 1363 with the carrier suspends liability for the payment of the tax for a period of 6 months from the date of shipment from the point of origin. If the person who is liable for the tax has not provided evidence to the carrier of the actual exportation of a shipment within such period, then the temporary suspension of the liability for the payment of the tax ceases and the carrier shall collect the tax from the person who paid the carrier for the transportation charge. If, after collection of the tax by the carrier, proof of exportation is subsequently received by the carrier, credit or refund of the tax may be obtained under the terms set forth in section 6415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</P>

              <P>(4) Documentary evidence of the exportation of the property may consist of a copy of export bill of lading, memorandum from the captain of the vessel, customs official, or a foreign consignee, shipper's export declaration, or other evidence sufficient to establish that the property has actually been exported. The person making the payment subject to tax shall furnish the appropriate documentary evidence to the carrier, or a statement that he holds such documentary evidence. In the latter case, the statement must: (i) Certify that the property covered by the Export Exemption Certificate, Form 1363 was exported; (ii) identify the evidence of exportation; (iii) specify the foreign destination or the possession of the United States to which <PRTPAGE P="290"/>the property was shipped; and (iv) show the place where such evidence will be available for inspection by internal revenue officers. Any documentary evidence or statement, as the case may be, shall be retained by the carrier and the person making the payment subject to tax for a period of three years from the last day of the month during which the shipment was made from the point of origin. If the person making the payment subject to tax is not the actual exporter and is unable to obtain documentary evidence of exportation, such person shall obtain from the person having custody of the documentary evidence a statement containing the same facts as listed above for a statement furnished to the carrier by the person liable for the tax. The person making the payment subject to tax shall furnish the original of such statement to the carrier and shall retain a copy in his records. The statement shall be retained for the same three year period as the evidence of exportation is to be retained.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Persons receiving payment must collect tax.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Except as otherwise provided in section 4263(a), every person receiving any payment for facilities or services on which a tax is imposed upon the payor thereof under chapter 33 shall collect the amount of the tax from the person making that payment. Under section 7501, all taxes collected in this manner are held by the collecting agent in trust for the United States. If the person from whom the tax is required to be collected refuses to pay it or if for any reason it is impossible for the collecting agent to collect the tax from that person, the collecting agent is required to report to the Commissioner the name and address of that person, the nature of the facility provided or service rendered, the amount paid therefore, and the date on which paid. Applicable October 1, 2004, this report must be made on or before the report due date. Upon receipt of this report the Commissioner will proceed against the person to whom the facilities were provided or the services rendered to assert the amount of tax due, affording that person the same conference, protest, and appellate rights as are available to other excise taxpayers. In addition, when a field or office audit of a collecting agent's records, or of a taxpayer's records, discloses that the collecting agent failed during prior reporting periods to collect taxes due, the Commissioner may assert those taxes directly against the person to whom the facilities were provided or the services rendered, whether or not the collecting agent had attempted collection or the person liable for the tax had refused payment thereof. For purposes of this section, the report due date is—<PRTPAGE P="291"/>

              <P>(a) In the case of a person using the alternative method of making deposits described in § 40.6302(c)-3 of this chapter, the due date of the return on which the item of adjustment relating to the uncollected tax would be reflected if items of adjustment were determined without regard to the limitation in § 40.6302(c)-3 of this chapter; and</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Imposition of tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Tax is imposed by section 5000B at the time of payment for any indoor tanning service.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Undesignated payment cards</E>—<E T="03">In general.</E> Payment for indoor tanning services is made when an undesignated payment card is redeemed, in whole or in part, to pay for indoor tanning services (and not when a payment is made to purchase the undesignated payment card).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) The term <E T="03">indoor tanning service</E> means a service employing any electronic product designed to incorporate one or more ultraviolet lamps and intended for the irradiation of an individual by ultraviolet radiation, with wavelengths in air between 200 and 400 nanometers, to induce skin tanning. The term does not include phototherapy service performed by, and on the premises of, a licensed medical professional (such as a dermatologist, psychologist, or registered nurse).</P>
              <P>(2) The term <E T="03">other goods and services</E> includes, but is not limited to, protective eyewear, footwear, towels, and tanning lotions; manicures, pedicures, and other cosmetic or spa treatments; and access to sport or exercise facilities.</P>
              <P>(3) The term <E T="03">phototherapy service</E> means a service that exposes an individual to specific wavelengths of light for the treatment of—</P>
              <P>(i) Dermatological conditions (such as acne, psoriasis, and eczema);</P>
              <P>(ii) Sleep disorders;</P>
              <P>(iii) Seasonal affective disorder or other psychiatric disorder;</P>
              <P>(iv) Neonatal jaundice;</P>
              <P>(v) Wound healing; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Other medical condition determined by a licensed medical professional to be treatable by exposing the individual to specific wavelengths of light.</P>
              <P>(4) The term <E T="03">provider</E> means a person that provides an indoor tanning service as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The term <E T="03">qualified physical fitness facility</E> means a facility—</P>
              <P>(i) In which the predominant business or activity is providing equipment and services to its members for purposes of exercise and physical fitness (determined by taking into consideration all of the facts and circumstances, such as the cost of the equipment, variety of services offered, actual usage of services by customers, revenue generated by different services, and how the entity holds itself out to the public through advertising or other means);</P>
              <P>(ii) In which providing indoor tanning services is not a substantial part of the business or activity; and</P>
              <P>(iii) That does not sell indoor tanning services for a fee to the public or otherwise offer different pricing options to its members based in whole or in part on access to indoor tanning services.</P>
              <P>(6) The term <E T="03">undesignated payment card</E> means a gift certificate, gift card, or similar item that can be redeemed for goods or services that may, but do not necessarily, include indoor tanning services.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tax on total amount paid for indoor tanning services</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The tax is imposed on the total amount paid for indoor tanning services, including any amount paid by insurance. The total amount paid is presumed to include the tax if the tax is not separately stated.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Free services and reduced rates.</E> The tax does not apply to indoor tanning services that are provided free of charge. Indoor tanning services are provided free of charge if no one pays <PRTPAGE P="292"/>anything of value to the provider of the service for the indoor tanning service. Thus, for example, tax is not imposed on the redemption of a promotional coupon for indoor tanning services if the coupon is provided at no cost and at no obligation to purchase anything. If indoor tanning services are provided at a reduced rate, the tax applies to the amount actually paid for the services.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Bonus points.</E> The redemption of benefits such as “bonus points” under a loyalty program or similar program or promotion is not a payment for indoor tanning services. Thus, for example, in a promotion that entitles a customer to a “free” tan with the purchase of four tans, tax is not imposed on the redemption of the fifth tan because the amount paid for the four tans included a reduced price for the fifth tan.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Other fees.</E> Fees for starting, joining, registering, enrolling, and similar fees paid to a provider to join a monthly (or other periodic) membership program that provides indoor tanning services are amounts paid for indoor tanning services. Similarly, amounts paid to a provider that temporarily suspend a periodic membership program are amounts paid for indoor tanning services.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Charges for other goods and services; tanning services separately stated.</E> If a payment covers charges for indoor tanning services as well as other goods and services, the charges for other goods and services may be excluded in computing the tax payable on the amount paid, if the charges—</P>
              <P>(i) Are separable (regardless of the manner of invoicing the charges);</P>
              <P>(ii) Do not exceed the fair market value of such other goods and services; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Are shown in the exact amounts in the provider's records pertaining to the indoor tanning services charge.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Charges for other goods and services; tanning services bundled.</E> This paragraph (d)(3) applies if paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not apply. If a provider offers indoor tanning services (whether of a specified or unlimited amount, including “free” or reduced-rate indoor tanning services) bundled with other goods and services, the payment for the bundled services includes an amount paid for indoor tanning services. The tax applies to that portion of the amount paid to the provider that is reasonably attributable to indoor tanning services. The amount reasonably attributable to indoor tanning services may be determined by—</P>
              <P>(i) Applying to the total amount paid a ratio determined by comparing—</P>
              <P>(A) The provider's charge for indoor tanning services not in bundled services or, if the provider only charges for indoor tanning services as part of bundled services, the fair market value of similar indoor tanning services (based on the amount charged by comparable providers in the same geographic area); to</P>
              <P>(B) The charge determined in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section plus the provider's charge for the other goods and services in the bundled services or, if the provider only charges for other goods and services as part of bundled services, the fair market value of similar goods and services (based on the amount charged by comparable providers in the same geographic area); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Any other method allowed in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Exemption; qualified physical fitness facilities.</E> No portion of a payment to a qualified physical fitness facility (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5) of this section) that includes access to indoor tanning services is treated as a payment for indoor tanning services.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Person liable for the tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The person who pays for the indoor tanning service is deemed to be the person on whom the service is performed for purposes of collecting the tax. Thus, the person paying for the indoor tanning service is liable for the tax at the time of payment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Undesignated payment cards</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of a payment made with an undesignated payment card (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section), the person who redeems the card, in whole or in part, to pay specifically for indoor tanning services is the person who pays for the indoor tanning services. Thus, the person who redeems an undesignated payment card, in whole or in part, to pay specifically for indoor tanning services is liable for the <PRTPAGE P="293"/>tax at the time such payment is made (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).</P>

              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1: Imposition of tax; general rule.</HD>
                <P>(i) P is a nail salon that also provides indoor tanning service incidental to its primary business of providing nail salon services. P advertises a price of $15.00 (exclusive of the tax imposed by section 5000B) for one 10-minute indoor tanning service. During a period when the tax is 10 percent of the amount paid, P calculates the section 5000B tax on $15.00 as provided by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Thus, the tax is $1.50 ($15.00 × 10%). The person paying for the service is liable for the tax when that person pays for the services. If P does not collect the tax from the person at the time of the payment for the services, P is liable for the tax.</P>
                <P>(ii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this example except that P's advertised price of $15.00 includes the tanning tax. In this case, the tax is $1.36 ($15.00 × 10%/110%) under the second sentence of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2: Charges for other goods and services; tanning services separately stated.</HD>
                <P>P provides indoor tanning services and other goods and services. On July 1, 2013, A, an individual, pays P for one 10-minute indoor tanning service and one pair of protective eyewear. P charges $15.00 for the 10-minute indoor tanning service and $2.00 for a pair of protective eyewear. The $2.00 charge for the protective eyewear does not exceed its fair market value. The invoice from P is $17.00 (exclusive of the tax imposed by section 5000B) and separately states the cost of the protective eyewear. Because the cost of the protective eyewear is separately stated, P calculates the section 5000B tax on $15.00 as provided by paragraph (d)(2) of this section. A is liable for the tax when A pays for the services. If P does not collect the tax from A at the time A pays for the services, P is liable for the tax.</P>

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3: Charges for other goods and services; tanning services bundled.</HD>
                <P>P provides indoor tanning services and other goods and services and offers bundled services. On July 1, 2013, A, an individual, buys bundled service from P that includes 10 swimming lessons, the use of towels while on P's premises, one pair of protective eyewear, and 2 “free” 10-minute indoor tanning services. P charges $252.00 (exclusive of the tax imposed by section 5000B) for the bundled services. If these services are purchased separately, P charges (exclusive of the tax imposed by section 5000B) $25.00 per swimming lesson, $15.00 for a 10-minute indoor tanning service, $2.00 for the protective eyewear, and does not charge for the use of towels while on P's premises. As determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the section 5000B tax applies to the amount reasonably attributable to the indoor tanning service, which is $26.81 (($30.00/$282.00) × $252.00).</P>

                <P>On July 1, 2013, A buys bundled services (described in <E T="03">Example 3</E>) from P as a gift for B. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, A is deemed to be the person on whom the indoor tanning services are performed for purposes of collecting the tax. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A is liable for the tax when A pays for the services. The tax will be computed under the rules of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If A does not pay the tax at the time A pays for the services, P is liable for the tax.</P>

                <P>(i) P operates a spa that provides a variety of cosmetic goods and services, including indoor tanning services. On July 1, 2013, A buys a gift certificate in the amount of $100.00 from P as a gift for B. The gift certificate may be redeemed by B for B's choice among several services offered by P, including indoor tanning services. On July 15, 2013, B partially redeems the gift certificate to pay for one 10-minute indoor tanning service.</P>

                <P>(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a payment for indoor tanning services is made, and the tax under section 5000B is imposed, on July 15, 2013, when B partially redeems the gift certificate to pay for one indoor tanning service. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, B is the person who pays for the indoor tanning services. Therefore, B is liable for the tax, computed under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section, and pays the tax by permitting P to debit the amount of the tax from the balance of the gift certificate or by paying the amount of the tax to P in cash. If B does not pay the tax at the time B partially redeems the gift certificate <PRTPAGE P="294"/>to pay for the indoor tanning services, P is liable for the tax.</P>

                <P>On July 1, 2013, A pays $1,000.00 (exclusive of the tax imposed by section 5000B) to spa P for the right to use the following equipment and services during the month of July: up to four massages or facials, unlimited use of a sauna, steam room, showers, and towel service, and unlimited indoor tanning services. If the services are purchased separately, P charges (exclusive of the tax imposed by section 5000B) $150.00 for unlimited indoor tanning services during the month of July, and $900.00 for the other equipment and services during the month of July, not including indoor tanning services. Under paragraph (b) of this section, A has made a payment for indoor tanning services and the tax will be computed under the rules of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. As determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the section 5000B tax applies to the amount reasonably attributable to the indoor tanning services, which is $142.86 (($150.00/$1050.00) × $1000.00). If A does not pay the tax at the time A pays for the bundled services, P is liable for the tax.</P>

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 7: Payments to qualified physical fitness facilities.</HD>
                <P>P operates a full-service gym facility that offers fitness classes, multiple exercise machines (such as treadmills, stationary bicycles, weight training machines, and free weights), and has as its predominant business providing these facilities, equipment, and services to members for purposes of exercise and physical fitness. P provides its members with access to indoor tanning services, comprised of two tanning beds that meet the definition of indoor tanning services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. P generally charges its members a fee for monthly usage of its facilities, equipment, and services, but also offers short-term or free trial memberships and allows non-members to purchase individual or a series of exercise classes. P does not charge any fee for the indoor tanning services, does not offer indoor tanning services separately from its other services, and has no membership tier or category that differs from others based on access to the indoor tanning services. P holds itself out to the public through advertising and marketing as providing equipment and services to improve physical fitness. On July 1, 2013, A pays a membership fee to P in return for use of P's facility during the month of July. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, no portion of A's membership fee payment is treated as a payment made for indoor tanning services, because A is a qualified physical fitness facility under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Therefore, no liability for tax arises under section 5000B.</P>
