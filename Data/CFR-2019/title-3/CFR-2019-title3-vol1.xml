    <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
    <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
    <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
    <IPAR>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
      <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
      <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
      <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
      <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
    </IPAR>
    <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
      <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
      <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
      <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

      <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
      <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
      <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
      <P>
        <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
      <P>
        <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
      <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
      <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
      <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation of This Title</HD>
    <P>This volume of “Title 3—The President” contains a compilation of Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President.</P>

    <P>The 2018 Compilation contains the full text of those documents signed by the President that were required to be published in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E> Signature date rather than publication date is the criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.</P>

    <P>Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are updated by individual issues of the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>.</P>
    <P>Presidential documents in this volume may be cited “3 CFR, 2018 Comp.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 9689 appearing on page 1 of this book, is “3 CFR, 2018 Comp., p. 1.” Chapter I entries may be cited “3 CFR.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this book, is “3 CFR 100.1.”</P>
    <P>This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 2019, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.</P>

    <P>For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled <E T="03">Proclamations and Executive Orders, Herbert Hoover</E> (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified Presidential documents are published in the <E T="03">Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders</E> (April 13, 1945—January 20, 1989). Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and statements, can be found in the <E T="03">Compilation of Presidential Documents</E> and the <E T="03">Public Papers of the Presidents</E> series. A selection of these Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Publishing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., dedicated his life to a vision: that all Americans would live free from injustice and enjoy equal opportunity as children of God. His strong, peaceful, and lifelong crusade against segregation and discrimination brought our Nation closer to the founding ideals set forth in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Today, as we come together to honor Dr. King, we know that America is stronger, more just, and more free because of his life and work.</FP>
  <FP>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the death of Dr. King, who was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968. As we approach this solemn milestone, we acknowledge our Nation's continuing debt to Dr. King's legacy. Dr. King advocated for the world we still demand—where the sacred rights of all Americans are protected, rural and urban communities are prosperous from coast to coast, and our limits and our opportunities are defined not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character. We remember the immense promise of liberty that lies at the foundation of our great Republic, the responsibility it demands from all of us who claim its benefits, and the many sacrifices of those who have come before us.</FP>
  <FP>Too often, however, we have neglected these ideals, and injustice has seeped into our politics and our society. Dr. King's peaceful crusade for justice and equality opened our Nation's eyes to the humbling truth that we were very far from fulfilling our obligation to the promises set forth by our forebearers.</FP>

  <FP>The Reverend's devotion to fighting the injustice of segregation and discrimination ignited the American spirit of fraternity and reminded us of <PRTPAGE P="2"/>our higher purpose. Through his words and work, he compelled us to hold ourselves to standards of moral character and integrity that are worthy of our Nation and of our humanity.</FP>
  <FP>Dr. King once said: “We refuse to believe there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this Nation.” We must work together to carry forward the American Dream, to ensure it is within reach not only for our children, but for future generations. As your President, I am committed to building and preserving a Nation where every American has opportunities to achieve a bright future. That is why we are expanding apprenticeship programs, preparing Americans for the jobs of our modernizing economy. We are also working every day to enhance access to capital and networks for minority and women entrepreneurs. With all we do, we aim to empower Americans to pursue their dreams.</FP>
  <FP>Importantly, in paying tribute to Dr. King, we are reminded that the duty lies with each of us to fulfill the vision of his life's work. Let us use our time, talents, and resources to give back to our communities and help those less fortunate than us. Particularly today, let us not forget Dr. King's own tireless spirit and efforts, as we work, celebrate, and pray alongside people of all backgrounds. As one people, let us rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans, and as people who share a common humanity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 15, 2018, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service programs and activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.DONALD J. TRUMP</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9690</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Religious Freedom Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Faith is embedded in the history, spirit, and soul of our Nation. On Religious Freedom Day, we celebrate the many faiths that make up our country, and we commemorate the 232nd anniversary of the passing of a State law that has shaped and secured our cherished legacy of religious liberty.</FP>

  <FP>Our forefathers, seeking refuge from religious persecution, believed in the eternal truth that freedom is not a gift from the government, but a sacred right from Almighty God. On the coattails of the American Revolution, on January 16, 1786, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. This seminal bill, penned by Thomas Jefferson, <PRTPAGE P="3"/>states that, “all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.” Five years later, these principles served as the inspiration for the First Amendment, which affirms our right to choose and exercise faith without government coercion or reprisal.</FP>
  <FP>Today, Americans from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds remain steadfast in a commitment to the inherent values of faith, honesty, integrity, and patriotism. Our Constitution and laws guarantee Americans the right not just to believe as they see fit, but to freely exercise their religion. Unfortunately, not all have recognized the importance of religious freedom, whether by threatening tax consequences for particular forms of religious speech, or forcing people to comply with laws that violate their core religious beliefs without sufficient justification. These incursions, little by little, can destroy the fundamental freedom underlying our democracy. Therefore, soon after taking office, I addressed these issues in an Executive Order that helps ensure Americans are able to follow their consciences without undue Government interference and the Department of Justice has issued guidance to Federal agencies regarding their compliance with laws that protect religious freedom. No American—whether a nun, nurse, baker, or business owner—should be forced to choose between the tenets of faith or adherence to the law.</FP>
  <FP>The United States is also the paramount champion for religious freedom around the world, because we do not believe that conscience rights are only for Americans. We will continue to condemn and combat extremism, terrorism, and violence against people of faith, including genocide waged by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria against Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims. We will be undeterred in our commitment to monitor religious persecution and implement policies that promote religious freedom. Through these efforts, we strive for the day when people of all faiths can follow their hearts and worship according to their consciences.</FP>
  <FP>The free exercise of religion is a source of personal and national stability, and its preservation is essential to protecting human dignity. Religious diversity strengthens our communities and promotes tolerance, respect, understanding, and equality. Faith breathes life and hope into our world. We must diligently guard, preserve, and cherish this unalienable right.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2018, as Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day with events and activities that remind us of our shared heritage of religious liberty and teach us to secure this blessing both at home and abroad.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9691</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Today, we focus our attention on the love and protection each person, born and unborn, deserves regardless of disability, gender, appearance, or ethnicity. Much of the greatest suffering in our Nation's history—and, indeed, our planet's history—has been the result of disgracefully misguided attempts to dehumanize whole classes of people based on these immutable characteristics. We cannot let this shameful history repeat itself in new forms, and we must be particularly vigilant to safeguard the most vulnerable lives among us. This is why we observe National Sanctity of Human Life Day: to affirm the truth that all life is sacred, that every person has inherent dignity and worth, and that no class of people should ever be discarded as “non-human.”</FP>
  <FP>Reverence for every human life, one of the values for which our Founding Fathers fought, defines the character of our Nation. Today, it moves us to promote the health of pregnant mothers and their unborn children. It animates our concern for single moms; the elderly, the infirm, and the disabled; and orphan and foster children. It compels us to address the opioid epidemic and to bring aid to those who struggle with mental illness. It gives us the courage to stand up for the weak and the powerless. And it dispels the notion that our worth depends on the extent to which we are planned for or wanted.</FP>
  <FP>Science continues to support and build the case for life. Medical technologies allow us to see images of the unborn children moving their newly formed fingers and toes, yawning, and even smiling. Those images present us with irrefutable evidence that babies are growing within their mothers' wombs—precious, unique lives, each deserving a future filled with promise and hope. We can also now operate on babies in utero to stave off life-threatening diseases. These important medical advances give us an even greater appreciation for the humanity of the unborn.</FP>
  <FP>Today, citizens throughout our great country are working for the cause of life and fighting for the unborn, driven by love and supported by both science and philosophy. These compassionate Americans are volunteers who assist women through difficult pregnancies, facilitate adoptions, and offer hope to those considering or recovering from abortions. They are medical providers who, often at the risk of their livelihood, conscientiously refuse to participate in abortions. And they are legislators who support health and safety standards, informed consent, parental notification, and bans on late-term abortions, when babies can feel pain. These undeterred warriors, many of whom travel to Washington, DC, every year for the March for Life, are changing hearts and saving lives through their passionate defense of and loving care for all human lives. Thankfully, the number of abortions, which has been in steady decline since 1980, is now at a historic low. Though the fight to protect life is not yet over, we commit to advocating each day for all who cannot speak for themselves.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and <PRTPAGE P="5"/>the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22, 2018, as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call on all Americans to reflect on the value of our lives; to respond to others in keeping with their inherent dignity; to act compassionately to those with disabilities, infirmities, or frailties; to look beyond external factors that might separate us; and to embrace the common humanity that unites us.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National School Choice Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>All American children deserve the opportunity to achieve their dreams through hard work and personal integrity. Our Nation's education policies must support them on their journeys, recognizing the diverse career goals and academic needs of students in communities across our country. During National School Choice Week, we honor those dedicated educators, administrators, and State and local lawmakers, who promote student-focused academic options for all families, as we increase educational freedom for all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>The United States is one of the most educated countries in the world. Almost 90 percent of American adults attain a high school diploma or GED. But our students deserve more than just a paper diploma. Indeed, they deserve access to an education that provides the tools needed to succeed in our ever-evolving world. To maintain our global leadership and strengthen our modern economy, America's education system must prepare students for the unforeseen challenges of the future. Communities that provide academic options—traditional public, public charter, private, magnet, parochial, virtual, and homeschooling—empower parents and guardians to select the best educational fit for their children.</FP>
  <FP>School choice helps alleviate common hindrances to success and creates the space necessary for students' aspirations to flourish. Families that participate in school choice programs are not the only ones who benefit from expanded educational options. Children in traditional public schools benefit as well. In fact, 29 of the top 31 empirical studies on the topic find that freedom of school choice improves the performance of nearby public schools.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is refocusing education policy on students. We are committed to empowering those most affected by school choice decisions and best suited to direct taxpayer resources, including States, local school boards, and families. As part of my steadfast commitment to invest in <PRTPAGE P="6"/>America's students, I signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December. One of the bill's provisions includes an expansion of 529 education savings plans so that their funds can be allocated tax-free to K-12 public, private, and religious educational expenses. By giving parents more control over their children's education, we are making strides toward a future of unprecedented educational attainment and freedom of choice. Under the leadership of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, we will continue to advance school choice so that every child in America has access to the tools best suited to enabling them to achieve the American Dream.</FP>
  <FP>During National School Choice Week, I encourage parents to explore innovative educational alternatives, and I challenge students to dream big and work hard for the futures they deserve. I also urge State and Federal lawmakers to embrace school choice and enact policies that empower families and strengthen communities.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 21 to January 27, 2018, as National School Choice Week.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">To Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells (Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products) and for Other PurposesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>1. On November 13, 2017, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) transmitted to the President a report (the “ITC Report”) on its investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2252), with respect to imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products (including, but not limited to, modules, laminates, panels, and building-integrated materials) (“CSPV products”). These products exclude certain products described in the ITC Notice of Institution, 82 <E T="03">Fed. Reg.</E> 25331 (June 1, 2017), and listed in subdivision (c)(ii) of Note 18 in Annex I to this proclamation.</FP>

  <FP>2. The ITC reached an affirmative determination under section 202(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b)) that CSPV products are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article.<PRTPAGE P="7"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>3. Pursuant to section 311(a) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “NAFTA Implementation Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3371(a)), the ITC made findings as to whether imports from Mexico and Canada, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports and contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports. The ITC made affirmative findings of contribution to injury with respect to imports of CSPV products from Mexico but made negative findings with respect to imports of CSPV products from Canada.</FP>
  <FP>4. On November 27, 2017, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) requested additional information from the ITC under section 203(a)(5) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(5)). On December 27, 2017, the ITC provided a response that identified unforeseen developments that led to the importation of CSPV products into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury (the “supplemental report”).</FP>
  <FP>5. The ITC commissioners transmitted to the President their individual recommendations with respect to the actions that each of them considered would address the serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry and be most effective in facilitating the efforts of the industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition. The ITC did not recommend an action within the meaning of section 202(e) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(e)).</FP>
  <FP>6. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and after taking into account the considerations specified in section 203(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(2)), the ITC Report, and the supplemental report, I have determined to implement action of a type described in section 203(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(a)(3)) (a “safeguard measure”), with regard to the following CSPV products:</FP>
  <P>(a) solar cells, whether or not assembled into modules or made up into panels provided for in subheading 8541.40.60 in Annex I to this proclamation;</P>
  <P>(b) parts or subassemblies of solar cells provided for in subheadings 8501.31.80, 8501.61.00, and 8507.20.80 in Annex I to this proclamation;</P>
  <P>(c) inverters or batteries with CSPV cells attached provided for in subheadings 8501.61.00 and 8507.20.80 in Annex I to this proclamation; and</P>
  <P>(d) DC generators with CSPV cells attached provided for in subheading 8501.31.80 in Annex I to this proclamation.</P>
  <FP>7. Pursuant to section 312(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3372(a)), I have determined after considering the ITC Report that imports of CSPV products from each of Mexico and Canada, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports and contribute importantly to the serious injury or threat of serious injury found by the ITC.</FP>
  <FP>8. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act, the action I have determined to take shall be a safeguard measure in the form of:</FP>

  <P>(a) a tariff-rate quota on imports of solar cells not partially or fully assembled into other products as described in paragraph 6 of this proclamation, imposed for a period of 4 years, with unchanging within-quota quantities and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered <PRTPAGE P="8"/>in excess of those quantities in the second, third, and fourth years, as provided in Annex I to this proclamation; and</P>
  <P>(b) an increase in duties on imports of modules, imposed for a period of 4 years, with annual reductions in the rates of duty in the second, third, and fourth years, as provided in Annex I to this proclamation.</P>
  <FP>I have determined to exclude from this action the products listed in subdivision (c)(ii) and (c)(iii) of Note 18 in Annex I to this proclamation.</FP>
  <FP>9. This safeguard measure shall apply to imports from all countries, except as provided in paragraph 10 of this proclamation.</FP>
  <FP>10. This safeguard measure shall not apply to imports of any product described in paragraph 6 of this proclamation of a developing country that is a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 in Annex I to this proclamation, as long as such a country's share of total imports of the product, based on imports during a recent representative period, does not exceed 3 percent, provided that imports that are the product of all such countries with less than 3 percent import share collectively account for not more than 9 percent of total imports of the product. If I determine that a surge in imports of a product described in paragraph 6 of this proclamation of a developing country that is a WTO Member results in imports of that product from that developing country exceeding either of the thresholds described in this paragraph, the safeguard measure shall be modified to apply to such product from such country.</FP>
  <FP>11. The in-quota quantity in each year under the tariff-rate quota described in paragraph 8 of this proclamation shall be allocated among all countries except those countries the products of which are excluded from such tariff-rate quota pursuant to paragraph 10 of this proclamation.</FP>
  <P/>
  <FP>12. Pursuant to section 203(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)(A)), I have determined that this safeguard measure will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs. If I determine that further action is appropriate and feasible to facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and to provide greater economic and social benefits than costs, or if I determine that the conditions under section 204(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)) are met, I shall reduce, modify, or terminate the action established in this proclamation accordingly. In addition, if I determine within 30 days of the date of this proclamation, as a result of consultations between the United States and other WTO Members pursuant to Article 12.3 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, that it is necessary to reduce, modify, or terminate the safeguard measure, I shall proclaim the corresponding reduction, modification, or termination of the safeguard measure within 40 days.</FP>

  </FP>
  <FP>14. Proclamation 9687 of December 22, 2017, ended the suspension of Argentina's designation as a GSP beneficiary developing country. That proclamation made corresponding modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Those modifications included technical errors, and I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct them.</FP>
  <FP>15. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 203, 502, and 604 of the Trade Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do proclaim that:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) In order to establish increases in duty and a tariff-rate quota on imports of the CSPV products described in paragraph 6 of this proclamation (other than excluded products), subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to this proclamation.

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(2) Except as provided in clause (3) below, imports of CSPV products of WTO Member developing countries, as listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 in Annex I to this proclamation, shall be excluded from the safeguard measure established in this proclamation. Imports of solar cells of those countries that are not partially or fully assembled into other products shall not be counted toward the tariff-rate quota limits that trigger the over-quota rates of duties.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(3) If, after the safeguard measure established in this proclamation takes effect, the USTR determines that:</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(7) Except as provided for in clause (8) of this proclamation, the modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, including Annex I, shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 7, 2018, and shall continue in effect as provided in Annex I to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. Any modifications to the HTS made pursuant to clause (3) or (4) of this proclamation shall take effect as indicated in a <E T="03">Federal Register</E> notice published in accordance with those clauses. One year from the termination of the safeguard measure established in this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions established in Annex I to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9694</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">To Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Large Residential WashersBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>1. On December 4, 2017, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) transmitted to the President a report (the “ITC Report”) on its investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2252), with respect to imports of large residential washers (“washers”). The product subject to the ITC's investigation and determination excluded certain washers described in the ITC Notice of Institution, 82 <E T="03">Fed. Reg.</E> 27075 (June 13, 2017), and listed in subdivision (c)(2) of Note 17 in the Annex to this proclamation.</FP>
  <FP>2. The ITC reached an affirmative determination under section 202(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b)) that the following products are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industries producing like or directly competitive articles:</FP>
  <P>(a) washers; and</P>
  <P>(b) certain washer parts, including (i) all cabinets, or portions thereof, designed for use in washers; (ii) all assembled tubs designed for use in washers which incorporate, at a minimum, a tub and a seal; (iii) all assembled baskets designed for use in washers which incorporate, at a minimum, a side wrapper, a base, and a drive hub; and (iv) any combination of the foregoing parts or subassemblies.</P>
  <FP>3. Pursuant to section 311(a) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “NAFTA Implementation Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3371(a)), the ITC made findings as to whether imports from Canada and Mexico, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports and contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports. The ITC made negative findings of contribution to injury with respect to imports of washers from Canada and Mexico.</FP>
  <FP>4. The ITC transmitted to the President its recommendations made pursuant to section 202(e) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(e)) with respect to the actions that, in its view, would address the serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry and be most effective in facilitating the efforts of the industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.</FP>
  <FP>5. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and after taking into account the considerations specified in section 203(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(2)) and the ITC Report, I have determined to implement action of a type described in section 203(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(a)(3)) (a “safeguard measure”), with regard to the following washers and covered washer parts:</FP>

  <P>(a) washers provided for in subheadings 8450.11.00 and 8450.20.00 in the Annex to this proclamation;<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
  </P>
  <P>(b) all cabinets, or portions thereof, designed for use in washers, and all assembled baskets designed for use in washers that incorporate, at a minimum, a side wrapper, a base, and a drive hub, provided for in subheading 8450.90.60 in the Annex to this proclamation;</P>
  <P>(c) all assembled tubs designed for use in washers that incorporate, at a minimum, a tub and a seal, provided for in subheading 8450.90.20 in the Annex to this proclamation;</P>
  <P>(d) any combination of the foregoing parts or subassemblies, provided for in subheadings 8450.90.20 or 8450.90.60 in the Annex to this proclamation.</P>
  <FP>6. Pursuant to section 312(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3372(a)), I have determined after considering the ITC Report that (a) imports from Canada of washers and covered washer parts, considered individually, do not account for a substantial share of total imports and do not contribute importantly to the serious injury or threat of serious injury found by the ITC; and (b) imports from Mexico of washers and covered washer parts, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports and have contributed importantly to the serious injury or threat of serious injury found by the ITC. Accordingly, pursuant to section 312(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3372(b)), I have excluded washers and covered washer parts that are the product of Canada from the actions I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act.</FP>
  <FP>7. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act, the action I have determined to take shall be a safeguard measure in the form of:</FP>
  <P>(a) a tariff-rate quota on imports of washers described in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 5 of this proclamation, imposed for a period of 3 years plus 1 day, with unchanging within-quota quantities, annual reductions in the rates of duties entered within those quantities in the second and third years, and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those quantities in the second and third years; and</P>
  <P>(b) a tariff-rate quota on imports of covered washer parts described in subparagraphs (b), (c), and (d) of paragraph 5 of this proclamation, imposed for a period of 3 years plus 1 day, with increasing within-quota quantities and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those quantities in the second and third years.</P>
  <FP>8. This safeguard measure shall apply to imports from all countries, except for products of Canada and except as provided in paragraph 9 of this proclamation.</FP>

  <FP>9. This safeguard measure shall not apply to imports of any product described in paragraph 5 of this proclamation of a developing country that is a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as listed in subdivision (b)(2) of Note 17 in the Annex to this proclamation, as long as such a country's share of total imports of the product, based on imports during a recent representative period, does not exceed 3 percent, provided that imports that are the product of all such countries with less than 3 percent import share collectively account for not more than 9 percent of total imports of the product. If I determine that a surge in imports of a product described in paragraph 5 of this proclamation of a developing country that is a WTO Member results in imports of that product from that developing country exceeding either of the thresholds described in this paragraph, the <PRTPAGE P="20"/>safeguard measure shall be modified to apply to such product from such country.</FP>
  <FP>10. The in-quota quantity in each year under the tariff-rate quotas described in paragraph 7 of this proclamation shall be allocated among all countries except those countries the products of which are excluded from such tariff-rate quota pursuant to paragraphs 8 and 9 of this proclamation.</FP>
  <FP>11. Pursuant to section 203(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)(A)), I have determined that this safeguard measure will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs. If I determine that further action is appropriate and feasible to facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and to provide greater economic and social benefits than costs, or if I determine that the conditions under section 204(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)) are met, I shall reduce, modify, or terminate the action established in this proclamation accordingly. In addition, if I determine within 30 days of the date of this proclamation, as a result of consultations between the United States and other WTO Members pursuant to Article 12.3 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, that it is necessary to reduce, modify, or terminate the safeguard measure, I shall proclaim the corresponding reduction, modification, or termination of the safeguard measure within 40 days.</FP>
  <FP>12. If I determine that a surge in imports of covered washer parts described in subparagraphs (b), (c), and (d) of paragraph 5 of this proclamation undermines the effectiveness of the safeguard measure, the safeguard measure shall be modified by imposing a quantitative restriction in lieu of the tariff-rate quota.</FP>
  <FP>13. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 203 and 604 of the Trade Act, section 312 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3372), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do proclaim that:</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) In order to establish increases in duty and a tariff-rate quota on imports of the washers and covered washer parts described in paragraph 5 of this proclamation (other than excluded products), subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation.

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(3) Except as provided in clause (4) below, imports of washers and covered washer parts that are the product of WTO Member developing countries, as listed in subdivision (b)(2) of Note 17 in the Annex to this proclamation, shall be excluded from the safeguard measure established in this proclamation, and such imports shall not be counted toward the tariff-rate quota limits that trigger the over-quota rates of duties.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(4) If, after the safeguard measure established in this proclamation takes effect, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) determines that:</FP>
  <P>(a) the share of total imports of the product of a country listed in subdivision (b)(2) of Note 17 in the Annex to this proclamation exceeds 3 percent,</P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(5) If, after the safeguard measure established in this proclamation takes effect, the USTR determines that the out-of-quota quantity in units of covered washer parts entered under the tariff lines in chapter 99 enumerated in the Annex to this proclamation has increased by an unjustifiable amount and undermines the effectiveness of the safeguard measure, the USTR is authorized, upon publishing a notice of such determination in the <E T="03">Federal Register,</E> to modify the HTS provisions created by the Annex to this proclamation so as to modify the tariff-rate quota on covered washer parts with a quantitative restriction on covered washer parts at a level that the USTR considers appropriate.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(6) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(7) The modifications to the HTS made in this proclamation, including the Annex hereto, shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 7, 2018, and shall continue in effect as provided in the Annex to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">American Heart Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>More than 600,000 Americans die of heart disease each year, making it the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. In addition to remembering our lost loved ones, American Heart Month is a time to raise awareness about the risk factors, warning signs, and symptoms associated with this killer disease. This February, we renew our commitment to the battle against cardiovascular disease. With the help of our Nation's leading medical professionals and appropriate preventative measures, we hope for a future where heart disease no longer claims the lives of so many American men and women.</FP>
  <FP>Thanks to ongoing advancements, medical procedures to treat heart conditions are now more precise and less invasive, recoveries are faster, and complications are fewer. We also now better understand conditions that increase the risk of heart disease among older adults—such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes—and more effective therapies and medications to prevent and treat them. And, we are better able to identify warning signs at an early stage.</FP>
  <FP>Even with these encouraging developments, nearly half of all Americans between ages 45 and 65 have heart disease or a related condition. The risk of heart disease increases with age, so for most people, prevention is the best deterrent. People should also understand that they may be subject to unique risk factors, often based on family history, which may require them to take appropriate, targeted preventative measures. Whatever risk factors they may face, there are many steps people can take to make coronary disease less likely. The most effective are eating a healthy diet, staying physically active, maintaining a healthy body weight, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and not smoking.</FP>
  <FP>During our observance of American Heart Month, we remember those we have lost to heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases. We honor healthcare providers and medical researchers who strive to advance both the treatment and prevention of this epidemic. And we encourage all Americans to commit to taking charge of their heart health, this month and every month.</FP>
  <FP>In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved on December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2018 as American Heart Month. The First Lady and I encourage all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 2, 2018, to raise awareness and reaffirm our commitment to fighting heart disease. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join <PRTPAGE P="30"/>me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.DONALD J. TRUMP</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National African American History Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>This February, we celebrate National African American History Month to honor the significant contributions African Americans have made to our great Nation—contributions that stand as a testament to their resolve, resilience, and courage. Over the course of our Nation's history, African Americans have endured egregious discrimination and bigotry. They have, nevertheless, always been determined to contribute their earnest efforts to America's greatness.</FP>
  <FP>This annual observance is an opportunity to remember the challenges of our past, but also to honor countless African-American heroes who inspire us to shape our country's future. This year's theme, “African Americans in Times of War,” calls our attention to the heroic contributions of African Americans during our Nation's military conflicts, from the Revolutionary War to present-day operations.</FP>
  <FP>Throughout our history, members of the Armed Forces have fought to secure freedom and liberty for all, defending our country both on our shores and in foreign lands. African Americans have shouldered an enormous share of the burden of battle in every American military engagement, donning our Nation's military uniforms to answer the call of duty. For far too long, African Americans bravely fought and died in the name of freedom, while at the same time struggling to attain equality, respect, and the full privileges of citizenship. Because of their love of country, these heroes insisted on serving and defending America despite racial prejudice, unequal treatment, diminished opportunities, and segregation. Their valorous acts in the face of grave injustice revealed the true meaning of American patriotism—service before self.</FP>

  <FP>It was not until 1948 that President Harry S. Truman ordered desegregation of the military, providing “equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Forces without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.” It took another 5 years before the Secretary of Defense abolished the last segregated African-American military unit. These hard won victories for justice catalyzed other victories, as they cast a harsh light on aspects of our social and civic lives that remained segregated. Those who fought against and ended segregation in the military reminded the Nation of its obligation to the self-evident truth of equality written into the Declaration of Independence.<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>We remember soldiers like Sergeant Henry Johnson of the Harlem Hellfighters, the all-black National Guard unit that was among the first American forces to arrive in France during World War I. Johnson suffered 21 wounds during front-line combat and received France's highest award for valor. To acknowledge his exceeding bravery, he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a Purple Heart. We remember pilot Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., who commanded the famed Tuskegee Airmen and became the first African American General in the United States Air Force. We remember soldiers like Major Charity Adams Earley, who was commander of the only all-African American Women's Army Corps unit that served overseas during World War II. She was a trailblazer in her efforts to recruit more women to military service in spite of rampant racism and segregation.</FP>
  <FP>These and countless other African Americans triumphed over ignorance, oppression, and injustice to make indelible contributions, not only to our military history, but even more importantly to our American history. They are an integral part of our Nation's story. We are indebted to the individual and collective perseverance and patriotism of these outstanding men and women, as we are to all African Americans who have served, and continue to serve in the Armed Forces of this great Nation.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2018 as National African American History Month.

  </FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS it is the policy of the United States that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger our security by posing a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the Cuban economy is in a relatively weak state, contributing to an outflow of its nationals toward the United States and neighboring countries;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the overarching objective of our policy is stability with our immediate neighboring countries and an outflow of Cuban nationals may have a destabilizing effect on the United States and its neighboring countries;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS it is the policy of the United States to ensure that engagement between the United States and Cuba advances the interests of the United States and of the Cuban people as described in National Security Presidential Memorandum-5 of June 16, 2017 (Strengthening the Policy of the United States Toward Cuba);</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the United States continues to maintain an embargo with respect to Cuba;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of the law of the United States and contrary to the policy of the United States;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of United States-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States and counter to the purpose of Executive Order 12807 of May 24, 1992, which is to ensure, among other things, safe, orderly, and legal migration;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the possibility of large-scale unauthorized entries of United States-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters would disturb the international relations of the United States by facilitating a possible mass migration of Cuban nationals;</FP>

Accordingly, I hereby direct as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, that may be used, or is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and that may create unsafe conditions, or result in unauthorized transactions, thereby threatening a disturbance of international relations.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">American Red Cross Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Since Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881, the organization has provided domestic disaster relief, assisted in international disaster relief, and supported the United States military in countless ways. Today, it is a renowned, life-saving force, supported by hundreds of thousands of <PRTPAGE P="35"/>volunteers and responsible for ensuring our Nation's blood supply is always at safe and sufficient levels. The American Red Cross also provides training and preparedness programs for Americans in safety-related fields and helps to connect our Nation's military service members with their families. During American Red Cross Month, we honor the organization's humanitarian mission, as well as its hard-working staff, dedicated volunteers, and generous supporters, whose donations are vital to sustaining the organization's operations.</FP>
  <FP>The American Red Cross plays an indispensable role in our Nation's healthcare system, including as the single largest supplier of blood and blood products in the United States. These blood products are vital for accident and burn victims, patients with conditions that require repeated transfusions, and patients undergoing advanced treatments like heart surgery and cancer therapy. On average, the American Red Cross collects nearly 4.9 million units of blood each year from more than 2.8 million donors. These donations help meet the needs of patients at approximately 2,600 hospitals and transfusion centers across the country.</FP>
  <FP>In addition to its healthcare mission, last year, the American Red Cross assisted millions of people affected by disasters in the United States and around the world. During a 45-day span, the organization responded to six of our Nation's largest and most complex disasters of 2017, including back-to-back hurricanes, the deadliest wildfires in California history, and the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. Globally, the American Red Cross provided aid to 26 countries in the aftermath of multiple natural disasters, including a drought and food crisis in Africa, the floods and migration crisis in Bangladesh, two earthquakes that shook Mexico just weeks apart, and floods and landslides in Nepal. The American Red Cross helped nearly 9,400 people search for loved ones separated from their families during these and other international calamities.</FP>
  <FP>Since its founding, the American Red Cross has also served as a vital conduit between our great men and women of the military and their families and support networks back home. To help caregivers meet the daily challenge of providing for our wounded, ill, and injured service members and veterans, the Military and Veteran Caregiver Network provides peer support through online resources and community-based groups. And last year alone, through its Hero Care Network, the American Red Cross relayed more than 304,000 urgent messages to more than 79,000 service members and their families.</FP>
  <FP>The dedicated staff members and volunteers of the American Red Cross make tremendous, positive contributions to both our Nation and the world. Their tireless endeavors truly deserve our unwavering respect, support, and gratitude.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2018 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and to support the work of the American Red Cross and their local chapters.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Irish-American Heritage Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During the month of St. Patrick's Day, we celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month and the tremendous role Irish immigrants and their descendants have played in the development of our great Nation. Irish-American Heritage Month is a great opportunity to celebrate the nearly 33 million Americans with Irish ancestry and their tremendous contributions to the betterment of our country. This month, and every month, we appreciate their efforts in helping usher in a new era of American prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>Irish Americans have distinguished themselves in every sector of American life. Many have been among the key architects of our country's greatness. Nine of the men who signed our Declaration of Independence were of Irish origin. Presidents Andrew Jackson, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and many others have traced their roots to the Emerald Isle. Businessman Henry Ford, founder of one of America's most iconic companies, was the son of an Irish immigrant.</FP>
  <FP>For centuries, the tenacious Irish spirit, paired with American self-reliance, has helped Irish immigrants and their descendants realize incredible dreams. With religious devotion, strength rooted in the love of family, and confidence in the promise of America, Irish Americans have engaged in the American experience in robust and meaningful ways. Their neighborhoods, schools, churches, and workplaces have affirmed the importance of faith, industry, and learning. It is, therefore, no wonder that American art, business, and public life are marked by Irish names and symbols.</FP>
  <FP>This month, Americans across the country will don the traditional green garb as we celebrate the patron saint of Ireland in an annual tribute to our shared and cherished heritage with that great country. As we spend this month honoring Irish Americans, we also pledge to further strengthen our relationship with the Emerald Isle itself, as we look forward to a bright future of greater friendship, cooperation, and commerce for centuries to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2018 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Women's History Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our history is rich with amazing stories of strong, courageous, and brilliant women. Since America's founding, women have played an integral part in American innovation and productivity, while simultaneously raising generations of lively children and providing leadership in their local communities.</FP>
  <FP>Time and time again, women have demonstrated resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges. America's women have readily tackled the disruptive forces and demands of wartime and embraced the technological and industrial advancements of the past 250 years. We have seen the incredible fortitude of women like Mary Katherine Goddard, who, in 1775, served as postmaster of the Baltimore post office and printed the second copy of the then-treasonous Declaration of Independence. We have followed the exceptional leadership of women like Olive Ann Beech, the first female head of a major aircraft company, which produced thousands of aircraft for the Allied effort during World War II. And, we have been transformed by women like Marva Collins, who was working as a full-time substitute teacher in Chicago when she founded a low-cost private school for low-income children being left behind by public schools.</FP>
  <FP>We can find similar stories throughout women's endeavors today. Women are leaders in a range of fields, from business and medicine to government and the arts. And, my Administration is committed to creating conditions that empower women to achieve even more. Access to paid family leave and affordable, high-quality childcare can help enhance women's ability to participate in the labor force and improve the economic security of their families. The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides new tax credits to businesses that offer paid family and medical leave to their employees. This landmark legislation also gives qualifying American families with children a significantly larger child tax credit and ensures that more families will be eligible to take advantage of this credit. When we support family-friendly policies, women have more freedom to explore opportunities and to thrive at work and at home.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is also supporting policies that promote women's economic empowerment. This is critical, as women now make up 40 percent of the entrepreneurs in the United States. Women business owners employ more than 8 million workers and provide them with more than $264 billion in wages and salaries. Just in the first year of my Administration, the Small <PRTPAGE P="38"/>Business Administration has increased lending to women-owned businesses by $128 million. We will also continue promoting the next generation of women leaders through mentoring, training, and education initiatives.</FP>
  <FP>Through these and other efforts, we will support women throughout our society, recognizing that the successes of women strengthen our families, our economy, and our Nation. As we reflect on the role of women throughout American history, we remember that women must always have access to all the opportunities that our Nation has to offer. Indeed, ensuring access to these opportunities is vital to our Nation's prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2018 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month and to celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, 2018, with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Consumer Protection Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>A vibrant economy, fueled by consumer confidence, is at the heart of American prosperity. Fraudulent and deceptive practices erode the marketplace, cost consumers billions of dollars each year, and undermine the well-being of Americans and their families. During National Consumer Protection Week, we focus on the importance of safeguarding and strengthening our economic health through consumer education and fraud prevention.</FP>
  <FP>American consumers must be alert for a broad range of scams and schemes, including identity theft, cybersecurity breaches, and charity fraud, all of which can destroy credit, diminish lifelong savings, and erode financial security and confidence. All consumers are vulnerable to financial exploitation, but depraved scammers often target the elderly. Such fraud can rob victims of their dignity and confidence, in addition to their resources. For this reason, I signed into law the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, which increases penalties for criminals who target older Americans.</FP>

  <FP>Imposter fraud is one of the fastest-growing scams today. It takes many forms and affects Americans of all ages, but the goal is always the same: to steal money after gaining the trust of an unsuspecting consumer. Imposters pose as bank representatives, government organizations, State lottery officials, first responders, Internal Revenue Service agents, technical support <PRTPAGE P="39"/>personnel, and shamelessly and cruelly, loved ones in distress. A growing number of imposter fraudsters claim affiliation with the military in an effort to trick service members or veterans into sharing sensitive personal or financial information. These con artists often convince people to send money or to provide access to their computers, which can turn out to be financially and personally devastating.</FP>
  <FP>National Consumer Protection Week is an opportunity for Americans to learn about their consumer rights so they can make better-informed financial decisions, avoid predatory practices, and protect their families from fraud and abuse. The Federal Government, in conjunction with a network of national organizations and State and local partners, provides information and resources that help Americans avoid, report, or recover from fraud and identity theft. I encourage all Americans to take this week to learn about how they can protect themselves and their families and defend their personal information from the growing number of online threats. The best weapon against fraud and extortion is a well-informed consumer. Together, we can work toward preserving economic prosperity and protecting personal financial security.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 4 through March 10, 2018, as National Consumer Protection Week. I encourage individuals, businesses, organizations, government agencies, and community groups to take advantage of the broad array of online resources offered by the Federal Trade Commission, and to share this information through consumer education activities in communities across the country.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>

  <FP>2. The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum is being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. The Secretary found that the present quantities of aluminum imports and the circumstances of global excess capacity for producing aluminum are “weakening our internal economy,” leaving the United States <PRTPAGE P="40"/>“almost totally reliant on foreign producers of primary aluminum” and “at risk of becoming completely reliant on foreign producers of high-purity aluminum that is essential for key military and commercial systems.” Because of these risks, and the risk that the domestic aluminum industry would become “unable to satisfy existing national security needs or respond to a national security emergency that requires a large increase in domestic production,” and taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security, <E T="03">see</E> 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary concluded that the present quantities and circumstances of aluminum imports threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.</FP>
  <FP>3. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended actions to adjust the imports of aluminum so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. Among those recommendations was a global tariff of 7.7 percent on imports of aluminum articles in order to reduce imports to a level that the Secretary assessed would enable domestic aluminum producers to use approximately 80 percent of existing domestic production capacity and thereby achieve long-term economic viability through increased production. The Secretary has also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient U.S. production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude aluminum articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based considerations.</FP>
  <FP>4. I concur in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and I have considered his recommendations.</FP>
  <FP>5. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>6. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>

  <FP>7. In the exercise of these authorities, I have decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles, as defined below, imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. In my judgment, this tariff is necessary and appropriate in light of the many factors I have considered, including the Secretary's report, updated import and production numbers for 2017, the failure of countries to agree on measures to reduce global excess capacity, the continued high level of imports since the beginning of the year, and special circumstances that exist with respect to Canada and Mexico. This relief will help our domestic aluminum industry to revive idled facilities, open closed smelters and mills, preserve necessary skills by hiring new aluminum workers, and maintain or increase production, which will reduce our Nation's need to rely on foreign producers for aluminum and ensure that domestic producers can continue to supply all the aluminum necessary for <PRTPAGE P="41"/>critical industries and national defense. Under current circumstances, this tariff is necessary and appropriate to address the threat that imports of aluminum articles pose to the national security.</FP>
  <FP>8. In adopting this tariff, I recognize that our Nation has important security relationships with some countries whose exports of aluminum to the United States weaken our internal economy and thereby threaten to impair the national security. I also recognize our shared concern about global excess capacity, a circumstance that is contributing to the threatened impairment of the national security. Any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country. Should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as our national security interests require.</FP>

  <FP>9. I conclude that Canada and Mexico present a special case. Given our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns, our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity for producing aluminum, the physical proximity of our respective industrial bases, the robust economic integration between our countries, the export of aluminum produced in the United States to Canada and Mexico, and the close relation of the economic welfare of the United States to our national security, <E T="03">see</E> 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from Canada and Mexico is to continue ongoing discussions with these countries and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. I expect that Canada and Mexico will take action to prevent transshipment of aluminum articles through Canada and Mexico to the United States.</FP>
  <FP>10. In the meantime, the tariff imposed by this proclamation is an important first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic aluminum industry. Without this tariff and satisfactory outcomes in ongoing negotiations with Canada and Mexico, the industry will continue to decline, leaving the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign producers of aluminum to meet our national security needs—a situation that is fundamentally inconsistent with the safety and security of the American people. It is my judgment that the tariff imposed by this proclamation is necessary and appropriate to adjust imports of aluminum articles so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>

  <FP>(1) For the purposes of this proclamation, “aluminum articles” are defined in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) as: (a) unwrought aluminum <PRTPAGE P="42"/>(HTS 7601); (b) aluminum bars, rods, and profiles (HTS 7604); (c) aluminum wire (HTS 7605); (d) aluminum plate, sheet, strip, and foil (flat rolled products) (HTS 7606 and 7607); (e) aluminum tubes and pipes and tube and pipe fitting (HTS 7608 and 7609); and (f) aluminum castings and forgings (HTS 7616.99.51.60 and 7616.99.51.70), including any subsequent revisions to these HTS classifications.</FP>
  <FP>(2) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of aluminum articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all imports of aluminum articles specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018. This rate of duty, which is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum articles from all countries except Canada and Mexico.</FP>

  <FP>(3) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and such other senior Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, is hereby authorized to provide relief from the additional duties set forth in clause 2 of this proclamation for any aluminum article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations.

The Secretary shall also inform the President of any circumstance that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate that the increase in duty rate provided for in this proclamation is no longer necessary.</P>
  <FP>(6) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>

  <FP>2. The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. The Secretary found that the present quantities of steel articles imports and the circumstances of global excess capacity for producing steel are “weakening our internal economy,” resulting in the persistent threat of further closures of domestic steel production facilities and the “shrinking [of our] ability to meet national security production requirements in a national emergency.” Because of these risks and the risk that the United States may be unable to “meet [steel] demands for national defense and critical industries in a national emergency,” and taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security, <E T="03">see</E> 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary concluded that the present quantities and circumstances of steel articles imports threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.</FP>
  <FP>3. In reaching this conclusion, the Secretary considered the previous U.S. Government measures and actions on steel articles imports and excess capacity, including actions taken under Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush. The Secretary also considered the Department of Commerce's narrower investigation of iron ore and semi-finished steel imports in 2001, and found the recommendations in that report to be outdated given the dramatic changes in the steel industry since 2001, including the increased level of global excess capacity, the increased level of imports, the reduction in basic oxygen furnace facilities, the number of idled facilities despite increased demand for steel in critical industries, and the potential impact of further plant closures on capacity needed in a national emergency.</FP>

  <FP>4. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended actions to adjust the imports of steel articles so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. Among those recommendations was a global tariff of 24 percent on imports of steel articles in order to reduce imports to a level that the Secretary assessed would enable domestic steel producers to use approximately 80 percent of existing domestic production capacity and thereby achieve long-term economic viability through increased production. The Secretary has also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any <PRTPAGE P="47"/>adopted import restrictions those steel articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient U.S. production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude steel articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based considerations.</FP>
  <FP>5. I concur in the Secretary's finding that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and I have considered his recommendations.</FP>
  <FP>6. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>8. In the exercise of these authorities, I have decided to adjust the imports of steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles, as defined below, imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. In my judgment, this tariff is necessary and appropriate in light of the many factors I have considered, including the Secretary's report, updated import and production numbers for 2017, the failure of countries to agree on measures to reduce global excess capacity, the continued high level of imports since the beginning of the year, and special circumstances that exist with respect to Canada and Mexico. This relief will help our domestic steel industry to revive idled facilities, open closed mills, preserve necessary skills by hiring new steel workers, and maintain or increase production, which will reduce our Nation's need to rely on foreign producers for steel and ensure that domestic producers can continue to supply all the steel necessary for critical industries and national defense. Under current circumstances, this tariff is necessary and appropriate to address the threat that imports of steel articles pose to the national security.</FP>
  <FP>9. In adopting this tariff, I recognize that our Nation has important security relationships with some countries whose exports of steel articles to the United States weaken our internal economy and thereby threaten to impair the national security. I also recognize our shared concern about global excess capacity, a circumstance that is contributing to the threatened impairment of the national security. Any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country. Should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as our national security interests require.</FP>

  <FP>10. I conclude that Canada and Mexico present a special case. Given our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns, our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity <PRTPAGE P="48"/>for producing steel, the physical proximity of our respective industrial bases, the robust economic integration between our countries, the export of steel articles produced in the United States to Canada and Mexico, and the close relation of the economic welfare of the United States to our national security, <E T="03">see</E> 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of steel articles from Canada and Mexico is to continue ongoing discussions with these countries and to exempt steel articles imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. I expect that Canada and Mexico will take action to prevent transshipment of steel articles through Canada and Mexico to the United States.</FP>
  <FP>11. In the meantime, the tariff imposed by this proclamation is an important first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic steel industry. Without this tariff and satisfactory outcomes in ongoing negotiations with Canada and Mexico, the industry will continue to decline, leaving the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign producers of steel to meet our national security needs—a situation that is fundamentally inconsistent with the safety and security of the American people. It is my judgment that the tariff imposed by this proclamation is necessary and appropriate to adjust imports of steel articles so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
  <FP>(1) For the purposes of this proclamation, “steel articles” are defined at the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) 6-digit level as: 7206.10 through 7216.50, 7216.99 through 7301.10, 7302.10, 7302.40 through 7302.90, and 7304.10 through 7306.90, including any subsequent revisions to these HTS classifications.</FP>
  <FP>(2) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of steel articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018. This rate of duty, which is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported steel articles, shall apply to imports of steel articles from all countries except Canada and Mexico.</FP>

  <FP>(3) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and such other senior Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, is hereby authorized to provide relief from the additional duties set forth in <PRTPAGE P="49"/>clause 2 of this proclamation for any steel article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations. Such relief shall be provided for a steel article only after a request for exclusion is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. If the Secretary determines that a particular steel article should be excluded, the Secretary shall, upon publishing a notice of such determination in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>, notify Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the duties described in clause 2 of this proclamation. The Secretary shall consult with CBP to determine whether the HTSUS provisions created by the Annex to this proclamation should be modified in order to ensure the proper administration of such exclusion, and, if so, shall make such modification to the HTSUS through a notice in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>.</FP>
  <FP>(4) Within 10 days after the date of this proclamation, the Secretary shall issue procedures for the requests for exclusion described in clause 3 of this proclamation. The issuance of such procedures is exempt from Executive Order 13771 of January 30, 2017 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs).</FP>
  <FP>(5) (a) The modifications to the HTSUS made by the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.</FP>
  <P>(b) The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of steel articles and shall, from time to time, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the USTR, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and such other senior Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, review the status of such imports with respect to the national security. The Secretary shall inform the President of any circumstances that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate the need for further action by the President under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. The Secretary shall also inform the President of any circumstance that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate that the increase in duty rate provided for in this proclamation is no longer necessary.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Poison Prevention Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Poisoning remains the leading cause of injury death in the United States. By taking the proper precautions and preparing for emergency situations, however, we can ensure our families and our communities avoid poisoning tragedies. During National Poison Prevention Week, we strive to reduce the frequency of poisoning deaths and educate ourselves about how to prevent accidental poisoning.</FP>
  <FP>Since 2000, the rate of accidental drug-poisoning deaths has more than quadrupled. Accidental poisoning due to drug overdose has taken immense tolls on families all across the country, and synthetic opioids continue to push the death count higher. In 2016 alone, we lost 116 people per day from opioid-related drug overdoses.</FP>
  <FP>To address this devastating epidemic, I have mobilized my entire Administration to combat drug addiction and opioid abuse. In October 2017, my Administration declared the opioid addiction crisis a national public health emergency. My 2018 Budget proposes $3 billion in new funding this year to combat the opioid epidemic, including through providing additional support for mental health initiatives.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has also led multiple national “Take Back Day” events, during which Americans have had the opportunity to safely dispose of unneeded prescription medications, preventing them from falling into the wrong hands. During the most recent event last October, the Drug Enforcement Administration collected 456 tons of prescription drugs for disposal at more than 5,300 collection sites. We will continue to champion these initiatives, which help prevent future tragedies from accidental poisonings and drug overdoses.</FP>
  <FP>This week, and every week, we warn all Americans about unintended exposure to poisons, so that we can reduce risks and prevent injuries and lost lives. We all can do our part by ensuring the products we bring into our homes, including medications, cleaning supplies, laundry detergents, small batteries, and other chemicals, are stored out of sight and out of reach of children. Accidental poisonings are preventable, and we must recommit ourselves to taking the necessary actions to protect our families, and improve the health, well-being, and prosperity of our Nation as a whole.</FP>
  <FP>To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventative measures, on September 26, 1961, the Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as “National Poison Prevention Week.”</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 18, 2018, through March 24, 2018, to be National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard their families from poisonous products, chemicals, and medicines, and drugs found in our homes, and <PRTPAGE P="53"/>to raise awareness of these dangers in order to prevent accidental injuries and deaths.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Vocational-Technical Education Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Across our great Nation, vocational-technical schools prepare Americans for careers in critical sectors of our economy, including manufacturing, construction, and technology fields. These industries are essential to our Nation's prosperity and security, as well as to our success in the competitive global marketplace. During Vocational-Technical Education Week, we highlight the important role that vocational and technical education plays in lifting up our communities and putting millions of Americans on the road to success.</FP>
  <FP>As I said in the State of the Union Address, my Administration is focused on investing in workforce development, especially as the recent tax cuts spur major job creation across the country. Today, 5.9 million American jobs are unfilled, and more than 350,000 of them are in manufacturing. Our Nation needs skilled workers to fill these roles, but the cost of postsecondary education continues to rise while many colleges and universities fail to adequately equip students with skills that align with the jobs in demand. Businesses large and small routinely observe that they cannot find qualified applicants to fill their vacancies. Vocational-technical schools help students explore their passions and enter the workforce with the necessary competencies to secure well-paying, family-sustaining jobs.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration recognizes the importance of increasing access to education, which is why my infrastructure proposal includes important reforms that will make it easier for Americans to access affordable, relevant, and high-quality education that leads to full-time work and long-term careers. It also includes initiatives related to workforce development. Specifically, my proposal would allow students to use Pell Grant funding to pay for cutting-edge, short-term programs that lead to quick and efficient transitions into the workforce. My proposal also calls on the Congress to reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical Education program and to improve it by making it easier for schools to partner with local businesses to expand apprenticeships, other forms of skills-based learning, and dual-enrollment programs. Further, I have called for reforming the Federal Work-Study program so that more Federal dollars go toward helping students—especially lower-income students—have more meaningful workplace experiences. Through a combination of administrative and legislative actions, <PRTPAGE P="54"/>my Administration is seeking to train the workforce of today for both the challenges and developments of tomorrow.</FP>
  <FP>Vocational-Technical Education Week reminds us to consider how we can help all Americans achieve the American Dream, by providing opportunities for all of our citizens to secure employment, success, and fulfillment. American strength and prosperity truly rely upon the educational advancement opportunities we make available to our Nation's youth.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THERFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 18 through March 24, 2018, as Vocational-Technical Education Week. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities designed to highlight the benefits of quality vocational-technical education.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Agriculture Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On National Agriculture Day, we acknowledge the tremendous work ethic, ingenuity, determination, and perseverance that define generations of American farmers. Because of their efforts, the United States produces an abundant supply of food, feed, and fuel for a growing global population. Our rich and abundant soil provides for more than just sustenance—it provides a beautiful and bountiful way of life for millions of Americans.</FP>
  <FP>America's strong agricultural sector is a key component of our Nation's robust economy and trade. Every $1 of United States agricultural and food exports creates another $1.27 in business activity. Our country's agriculture exports are valued at more than $100 billion, and every $1 billion in exports supports approximately 8,000 American jobs. Moreover, agriculture contributes to at least 8.6 percent of our gross domestic product. The economic boost from our agriculture reaches beyond the fields our farmers tend, with unrivaled skill and diligence, to communities all across America.</FP>

  <FP>America's farmers, growers, ranchers, foresters, and agricultural scientists and engineers are world-leading innovators, exploring new research and technologies like advancements in biotechnology and the use of automated vehicles that enable precision agriculture to maximize yields and minimize environmental impacts. My Administration proudly supports them in their pioneering endeavors. In this new era of American agriculture, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing in rural broadband access, roads, and <PRTPAGE P="55"/>bridges, and is supplying affordable, reliable power to those living on the outskirts of larger cities and towns. These investments in American infrastructure will improve the quality of life in rural America for years to come.</FP>
  <FP>To help the American agricultural economy succeed in an increasingly competitive global market, I signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the largest tax cut and reform legislation in American history. This legislation is providing much needed relief to America's farmers, who can now expense 100 percent of their capital investments, including expenditures for farm equipment, over the next 4 years. Additionally, under this new legislation, the vast majority of family farms will now be exempt from the death tax.</FP>
  <FP>American agriculture is an integral part of our success as a Nation, uniquely tied to both our country's culture and economy. Today, and every day, we cherish our Nation's rich agricultural history and celebrate the greatness of the American farmer.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 20, 2018, as National Agriculture Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this day by recognizing the preeminent role that agriculture plays in our daily lives, acknowledging agriculture's continuing importance to rural America and our country's economy, and expressing our deep appreciation of farmers, growers, ranchers, producers, national forest system stewards, private agricultural stewards, and those who work in the agriculture sector across the Nation.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On this celebration of Greek Independence Day, we reflect on the common bonds of history and heritage that connect the United States and Greece. Our nations share cultural, economic, and defense interests, but the foundation of our abiding friendship is our unwavering commitment to liberty and our shared love of democratic institutions.</FP>

  <FP>As the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, Greece has a rich and glorious heritage, resplendent in its influential contributions to literature, philosophy, and science. The ancient Greeks fostered the timeless ideal of human liberty, which inspired our Nation's Founders as they drafted our Constitution and established our Republic. <PRTPAGE P="56"/>The legacy of ancient Greece carries on today, as liberty continues to serve as a beacon of hope to all who long for a better life.</FP>
  <FP>It was an honor to welcome Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House last year. His visit underscored the importance of our bilateral relationship and our ongoing strategic cooperation on issues such as law enforcement, counterterrorism, and matters of defense, energy, commerce, and trade. Greece continues to meet its NATO obligations on defense spending and serves as a gracious host for our naval forces at Souda Bay. Our Greek-American partnership is strong, and we are grateful to have such a tremendous ally and friend in Greece.</FP>
  <FP>Our nations continue to expand our economic and commercial ties, creating jobs and opportunities for investment and trade on both sides of the Atlantic. This year, the United States is proud to serve as the honored country at the 2018 Thessaloniki International Fair. This historic business and trade exhibition will showcase American technology, enterprise, and innovation, and will further enhance the partnership and cooperation between our great nations.</FP>
  <FP>In 2018, we also celebrate 70 years of Fulbright Greece, a program of educational and cultural exchanges between the United States and Greece. Fulbright Greece, the oldest Fulbright program in Europe, is the flagship international exchange program sponsored by our Government. Since 1948, the program has awarded grants to more than 5,500 Greek and American citizens to study, teach, or conduct research, enriching both of our countries.</FP>
  <FP>The United States and Greece have an enduring bond based on mutual respect, shared values, and an abiding commitment to freedom and sovereignty. More than 1.3 million Americans claim Greek origin. The Greek-American community has made countless positive contributions to our Nation and has played a vital role in maintaining our strong relationship with Greece. On this 197th anniversary celebration of Greek Independence Day, we honor Greece as a strong, faithful ally and valued partner in promoting peace, liberty, and prosperity around the world.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2018, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704 (aluminum articles), by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico.</FP>
  <FP>3. In proclaiming this tariff, I recognized that our Nation has important security relationships with some countries whose exports of aluminum articles to the United States weaken our internal economy and thereby threaten to impair the national security. I also recognized our shared concern about global excess capacity, a circumstance that is contributing to the threatened impairment of the national security. I further determined that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>

  <FP>4. The United States is continuing discussions with Canada and Mexico, as well as the following countries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from those countries: the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries. Each of these countries has an important security relationship with the United States and I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports from aluminum articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. Any country not listed in this proclamation with which we have a security relationship remains welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports of aluminum articles from that country.<PRTPAGE P="58"/>

The United States has an important security relationship with Australia, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns, particularly through our security, defense, and intelligence partnership; the strong economic and strategic partnership between our countries; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production; and the integration of Australian persons and organizations into the national technology and industrial base of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>6. The United States has an important security relationship with Argentina, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns in Latin America, particularly the threat posed by instability in Venezuela; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production; the reciprocal investment in our respective industrial bases; and the strong economic integration between our countries.</FP>
  <FP>7. The United States has an important security relationship with South Korea, including our shared commitment to eliminating the North Korean nuclear threat; our decades-old military alliance; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production; and our strong economic and strategic partnership.</FP>
  <FP>8. The United States has an important security relationship with Brazil, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns in Latin America; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production; the reciprocal investment in our respective industrial bases; and the strong economic integration between our countries.</FP>
  <FP>9. The United States has an important security relationship with the EU and its constituent member countries, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in national security concerns; the strong economic and strategic partnership between the United States and the EU, and between the United States and EU member countries; and our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production.</FP>
  <FP>10. In light of the foregoing, I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries is to continue ongoing discussions and to increase strategic partnerships, including those with respect to reducing global excess capacity in aluminum production by addressing its root causes. In my judgment, discussions regarding measures to reduce excess aluminum production and excess aluminum capacity, measures that will increase domestic capacity utilization, and other satisfactory alternative means will be most productive if the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 on aluminum articles imports from these countries is removed at this time.</FP>

  <FP>11. However, the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 remains an important first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic aluminum industry and removing the threatened impairment of the national security. Without this tariff and the adoption of satisfactory alternative means addressing long-term solutions in ongoing discussions with the countries listed as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation, the industry will continue to decline, leaving the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign producers of aluminum to meet our national security needs—a situation <PRTPAGE P="59"/>that is fundamentally inconsistent with the safety and security of the American people. As a result, unless I determine by further proclamation that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from a particular country listed as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation, the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 shall be effective May 1, 2018, for the countries listed as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation. In the event that a satisfactory alternative means is reached such that I decide to exclude on a long-term basis a particular country from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, I will also consider whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 as it applies to other countries. Because the current tariff exemptions are temporary, however, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to maintain the current tariff level at this time.</FP>
  <FP>12. In the meantime, to prevent transshipment, excess production, or other actions that would lead to increased exports of aluminum articles to the United States, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall advise me on the appropriate means to ensure that imports from countries exempt from the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704 do not undermine the national security objectives of such tariff. If necessary and appropriate, I will consider directing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security to implement a quota as soon as practicable, and will take into account all aluminum articles imports since January 1, 2018, in setting the amount of such quota.</FP>
  <FP>13. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>14. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>

  <P>(1) Imports of all aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, from the countries listed in this clause shall be exempt from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 1, 2018. Further, clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 is amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting the following two sentences: “Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all aluminum articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on or after 12:01 <PRTPAGE P="60"/>a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil, and the member countries of the European Union, and (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 1, 2018, from all countries. This rate of duty, which is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum articles from each country as specified in the preceding sentence.”.</P>
  <P>(2) Paragraph (a) of U.S. note 19, added to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS by the Annex to Proclamation 9704, is amended by replacing “Canada and of Mexico” with “Canada, of Mexico, of Australia, of Argentina, of South Korea, of Brazil, and of the member countries of the European Union”.</P>

  <P>(4) The exemption afforded to aluminum articles from Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil, and the member countries of the EU shall apply only to aluminum articles of such countries entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, through the close of April 30, 2018, at which time Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil, and the member countries of the EU shall be deleted from paragraph (a) of U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS and from the article description of heading 9903.85.01 of the HTSUS.</P>
  <P>(5) Any aluminum article that is admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, may only be admitted as “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading. Any aluminum article that was admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone under “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, will likewise be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rates of duty related to the classification under applicable HTSUS subheadings imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amended by this proclamation.</P>
  <P>(6) Clause 3 of Proclamation 9704 is amended by inserting a new third sentence reading as follows: “Such relief may be provided to directly affected parties on a party-by-party basis taking into account the regional availability of particular articles, the ability to transport articles within the United States, and any other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.”.</P>
  <P>(7) Clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by clause 6 of this proclamation, is further amended by inserting a new fifth sentence as follows: “For merchandise entered on or after the date the directly affected party submitted a request for exclusion, such relief shall be retroactive to the date the request for exclusion was posted for public comment.”.</P>

  <P>(8) The Secretary, in consultation with CBP and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>

  <EAR>Proc. 9711</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel mill articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of steel mill articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of this proclamation (steel articles), by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico.</FP>
  <FP>3. In proclaiming this tariff, I recognized that our Nation has important security relationships with some countries whose exports of steel articles to the United States weaken our internal economy and thereby threaten to impair the national security. I also recognized our shared concern about global excess capacity, a circumstance that is contributing to the threatened impairment of the national security. I further determined that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>

  <FP>4. The United States is continuing discussions with Canada and Mexico, as well as the following countries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of steel articles from those countries: the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil), and the European Union (EU) on <PRTPAGE P="62"/>behalf of its member countries. Each of these countries has an important security relationship with the United States and I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports from steel articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to exempt steel articles imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. Any country not listed in this proclamation with which we have a security relationship remains welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports of steel articles from that country.</FP>
  <FP>5. The United States has an important security relationship with Australia, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns, particularly through our security, defense, and intelligence partnership; the strong economic and strategic partnership between our countries; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in steel production; and the integration of Australian persons and organizations into the national technology and industrial base of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>6. The United States has an important security relationship with Argentina, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns in Latin America, particularly the threat posed by instability in Venezuela; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in steel production; the reciprocal investment in our respective industrial bases; and the strong economic integration between our countries.</FP>
  <FP>7. The United States has an important security relationship with South Korea, including our shared commitment to eliminating the North Korean nuclear threat; our decades-old military alliance; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in steel production; and our strong economic and strategic partnership.</FP>
  <FP>8. The United States has an important security relationship with Brazil, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns in Latin America; our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in steel production; the reciprocal investment in our respective industrial bases; and the strong economic integration between our countries.</FP>
  <FP>9. The United States has an important security relationship with the EU and its constituent member countries, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in national security concerns; the strong economic and strategic partnership between the United States and the EU, and between the United States and EU member countries; and our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in steel production.</FP>

  <FP>10. In light of the foregoing, I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of steel articles from these countries is to continue ongoing discussions and to increase strategic partnerships, including those with respect to reducing global excess capacity in steel production by addressing its root causes. In my judgment, discussions regarding measures to reduce excess steel production and excess steel capacity, measures that will increase domestic capacity utilization, and other satisfactory alternative means will be <PRTPAGE P="63"/>most productive if the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 on steel articles imports from these countries is removed at this time.</FP>
  <FP>11. However, the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9705 remains an important first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic steel industry and removing the threatened impairment of the national security. Without this tariff and the adoption of satisfactory alternative means addressing long-term solutions in ongoing discussions with the countries listed as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation, the industry will continue to decline, leaving the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign producers of steel to meet our national security needs—a situation that is fundamentally inconsistent with the safety and security of the American people.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>A quality education can give every child, regardless of his or her circumstances, the opportunity to grow, thrive, succeed, and achieve their version of the American Dream. On Education and Sharing Day, we acknowledge the power that a solid academic foundation, combined with the transformative power of time-honored values and ethics, can have in helping young people achieve lives of purpose and passion.</FP>

  <FP>Today, we honor the life and legacy of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The Lubavitcher Rebbe was a widely respected scholar and leader of faith who believed in the potential of all persons and sought to empower young people through education, character development, and civic pride. Throughout his long and distinguished life, Rabbi Schneerson inspired millions of people, across multiple generations, through his example of compassion, wisdom, and courage in the face of oppression. He recognized that access to education, paired with moral and spiritual development, could transform the world for good, and he devoted his life to these principles. His commitment to invest in the lives of the next generation led to the establishment of academic and outreach centers to help grow and engage young minds and provide them with spiritual and material assistance. Thanks to his drive and dedication, these educational and social service centers can be found in every State and throughout the world.<PRTPAGE P="66"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The Lubavitcher Rebbe believed that even in the darkest place, “the light of a single candle can be seen far and wide.” His life is an example of the power of one person to influence the lives of many. May we strive to be that light for future generations, instilling in them the value of education and the virtues of courage and compassion that can impact our communities and the world for the better.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 27, 2018, as “Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A.” I call upon government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Cancer Control Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Cancer Control Month, we remember the loved ones we have lost to cancer and recommit our support for the courageous individuals who are fighting this terrible disease. We also pause to thank the devoted healthcare professionals, scientists, and researchers who work tirelessly to discover a cure for cancer and whose combined efforts have contributed to an encouraging decline in the overall rate of deaths from cancer over the past two decades.</FP>
  <FP>American innovators and entrepreneurs have made many incredible scientific breakthroughs during the past century. In the field of medicine, American scientists have been at the forefront of world-class research that has developed increasingly effective cancer prevention strategies and treatments. Through public- and private-sector partnerships, Americans have made critical advances to support and expand precision medicine and immunotherapy approaches to cancer. These innovations have given us greater ability to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and have helped more than 15 million Americans beat this disease.</FP>

  <FP>Despite these tremendous strides, we recognize the staggering number of Americans who have lost their battles with cancer. Last year alone, cancer took the lives of approximately 600,000 adults and 2,000 children in the United States, making it the second leading cause of death in our Nation. According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly 40 percent of all Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Together, we must take action to prevent and combat cancer, including maintaining healthy diets and weight and making physical activity a part of each day. Regular <PRTPAGE P="67"/>screenings and physicals, as well as knowledge of family medical history, are also crucial to catching cancers in earlier, more treatable stages.</FP>
  <FP>As we observe National Cancer Control Month, let us raise awareness of the measures we can take to prevent cancer and strengthen our resolve to find a cure for this horrible disease, which continues to cause so many families such great pain. Let us also honor the determination, courage, and strength of our cancer survivors. Their stories are an inspiration to all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2018 as Cancer Control Month. I call upon the people of the United States to speak with their doctors and healthcare providers to learn more about preventative measures that can save lives. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join me in recognizing National Cancer Control Month.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every child is a precious and unique gift who deserves the security of a loving and nurturing home. When supported by encouraging families and safe, strong communities, all children have the chance to reach their full potential and access the unlimited opportunities that our great Nation has to offer. To realize this truth, we must dedicate ourselves to the noble cause of protecting and caring for our children.</FP>

  <FP>National Child Abuse Prevention Month is an annual reminder that not every home is a haven of acceptance and unconditional love. Too often, childhood is marred with pain, violence, neglect, and abuse, which can have lifelong psychological, emotional, and physical consequences. At no fault of their own, some children are subjected to the most depraved forms of child abuse and neglect, without reprieve and, sometimes, without any knowledge that they are being maltreated. The statistics are shocking: a quarter of all children experience some form of child abuse or neglect in their lifetime. The financial consequences of this depravity are dire. By some estimates, the lifetime cost of child abuse and neglect is $124 billion per year. The human cost—measured in lost development, potential, and flourishing—is incalculable.<PRTPAGE P="68"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>To improve the statistics and the well-being of our Nation's children, we must become more aware of the signs and symptoms of child abuse and take action as necessary. We should not allow pride or discomfort to prevent us from helping a child who is truly suffering. We must be a Nation committed to taking action in the face of adversity and uncertainty, particularly when done to enhance the safety or security of children.</FP>
  <FP>The Child Welfare Information Gateway (CWIG) notes that children who show sudden changes in behavior, who have not received treatment for physical or medical problems brought to their parents' attention, or who are always watchful, as if preparing for something bad to happen, may be exhibiting signs of child abuse. Though the presence of one or some of these signs alone does not necessarily mean that a child has been the victim of child abuse or neglect, it is vital that we understand and remain vigilant for these indicators. As Americans we must do all that we can.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we honor the professionals, volunteers, and organizations who work tirelessly to protect at-risk children and care for those who have experienced abuse or neglect. This difficult work is critical to ensuring the safety and protection of our children, to strengthening our communities, and to stopping cycles of violence harm. There are no substitutes for caring parents and guardians. But we recognize that friends, neighbors, educators, and places of worship have important roles to play in fostering the well-being of children. We are especially grateful to foster and adoptive parents, who open their lives to children in need of loving and caring homes. We can and should continue to work together to help provide healthy, happy, and safe environments for all children.</FP>
  <FP>We must always remember that all children are blessings from our Creator. They are endowed from conception with value, purpose, and human dignity. They are a source of unmatched joy, and they represent our Nation's future. It is thus our civic and moral responsibility to help every child experience a childhood free from abuse and mistreatment, guiding them toward a future full of hope and promise. I encourage all Americans to nurture the children in their lives and to extend a hand to those in need of love, protection, or even just attention. Only together can we put an end to the tragedy of child abuse and neglect.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Donate Life Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Americans celebrate the blessing of life in many ways, but perhaps none is more transformative than their choice to donate organs or tissue to family members, friends, or to people they may not ever meet. During National Donate Life Month, we honor our Nation's organ and tissue donors for their decision to give the precious gift of life to someone in need. We also give thanks to the many remarkable medical professionals, scientists, and researchers who have dedicated themselves to improving the health of others.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration supports efforts to raise awareness about the life-saving power of organ donation. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network reports that, in 2017, there were nearly 35,000 transplants performed, a 3.4 percent increase from 2016, and the fifth consecutive record-setting year for transplants in the United States. Last year, more than 16,000 living and deceased individuals donated the gift of life to someone in need through an organ or tissue donation.</FP>
  <FP>Every person, regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, or economic status, has the power and the potential to transform a life through organ and tissue donation. Despite record setting years, we are still working to overcome a gap between the availability of organs and people in need of an organ donation. Today, nearly 115,000 Americans are awaiting a lifesaving transplant, and a new name appears on the national transplant waiting list every 10 minutes. Amazingly, 1 donor can save up to 8 lives through organ donation and enhance the lives of up to 50 people through tissue donation. This month, I encourage all Americans to consider participating in the gift of life by becoming organ and tissue donors.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2018 as National Donate Life Month. I call upon health professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to help raise awareness of the urgent need for organ and tissue donors throughout our Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Fair Housing Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During April, America reaffirms its commitment to ending housing discrimination by celebrating National Fair Housing Month. This year, we mark a particularly important milestone in this effort. Fifty years ago this April 11—just 7 days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968 into law. The Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, color, religion, or national origin, is Title VIII of that law.</FP>
  <FP>Over the last 50 years, our Nation has made great strides toward ensuring Americans have access to fair and affordable housing free from discrimination. In addition to enforcement of the prohibitions in the original Fair Housing Act, the Congress has twice amended the law to expand and enhance its protections. In 1974, the Congress acted to prohibit housing discrimination based on sex, and in 1988, the Congress extended the law's protections to persons living with disabilities and to families with children. These actions have helped create a more fair and just market for housing throughout our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has continued to fight for the American people and for equal access to opportunity in America. That is why we are exploring and developing evidence-based reforms to enhance the development of affordable housing options, free from discrimination, that can alleviate poverty and promote opportunity. My Administration intends to deliver on the promise outlined by the Fair Housing Act, by ending prejudice and unlawful discriminatory practices in the sale, lease, and financing of housing, expanding the availability of affordable housing, promoting sustainable homeownership opportunities, encouraging economic mobility, and creating more vibrant communities.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, do hereby proclaim April 2018 as National Fair Housing Month. I urge all Americans to learn more about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and reaffirm their commitment to making homeownership within reach, no matter one's background.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we remain steadfast in our efforts to stop crimes of sexual violence, provide care for victims, enforce the law, prosecute offenders, and raise awareness about the many forms of sexual assault. We must continue our work to eliminate sexual assault from our society and promote safe relationships, homes, and communities.</FP>
  <FP>Sexual assault crimes remain tragically common in our society, and offenders too often evade accountability. These heinous crimes are committed indiscriminately: in intimate relationships, in public spaces, and in the workplace.</FP>
  <FP>We must respond to sexual assault by identifying and holding perpetrators accountable. Too often, however, the victims of assault remain silent. They may fear retribution from their offender, lack faith in the justice system, or have difficulty confronting the pain associated with the traumatic experience. My Administration is committed to raising awareness about sexual assault and to empowering victims to identify perpetrators so that they can be held accountable. We must make it as easy as possible for those who have suffered from sexual assault to alert the authorities and to speak about the experience with their family and friends.</FP>
  <FP>When victims seek help, responses must be carefully tailored to the context in which the sexual assault occurred and the unique needs of each victim. To better assist victims, the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women has developed the Sexual Assault Victim Intervention Services Technical Assistance Center (SAVIS TAC). This new resource will help community officials and organizations appropriately respond to sexual assault by expanding their understanding of the type of support likely to be effective in each unique circumstance. Participants in the SAVIS TAC initiative will use available funds to provide intensive training and resources to service providers. With these resources, service providers, including rape crisis centers and other sexual assault and domestic violence organizations can build organizational and staff capacity for providing comprehensive sexual assault victim intervention services.</FP>

  <FP>Together, during Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we recommit ourselves to doing our part to help stop sexual violence. We must not be afraid to talk about sexual assualt and sexual assult prevention with our loved ones, in our communities, and with those who have experienced these tragedies. We must encourage victims to report sexual assault and law enforcement to hold offenders accountable, and we must support victims and survivors unremmittingly. Through a concerted effort to better educate ourselves, empower victims, and punish criminals, our Nation will move closer to ending the grief, fear, and suffering caused by sexual assult. The prevention of sexual violence is everyone's concern.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Second Chance Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Second Chance Month, our Nation emphasizes the need to prevent crime on our streets, to respect the rule of law by prosecuting individuals who break the law, and to provide opportunities for people with criminal records to earn an honest second chance. Affording those who have been held accountable for their crimes an opportunity to become contributing members of society is a critical element of criminal justice that can reduce our crime rates and prison populations, decrease burdens to the American taxpayer, and make America safer.</FP>
  <FP>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, each year, approximately 650,000 individuals complete prison sentences and rejoin society. Unfortunately, two-thirds of these individuals are re-arrested within 3 years of their release. We must do more—and use all the tools at our disposal—to break this vicious cycle of crime and diminish the rate of recidivism.</FP>
  <FP>For the millions of American citizens with criminal records, the keys to successful re-entry are becoming employable and securing employment. Beyond the income earned from a steady paycheck, gainful employment teaches responsibility and commitment and affirms human dignity. As a Nation, we are stronger when more individuals have stable jobs that allow them to provide for both themselves and their loved ones.</FP>

  <FP>I am committed to advancing reform efforts to prevent crime, improve reentry, and reduce recidivism. I expressed this commitment in my 2018 State of the Union Address and reinforced it by signing an Executive Order to reinvigorate the “Federal Interagency Council on Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry.” In the spirit of these efforts, I call on Federal, State, and local prison systems to implement evidence-based programs that will provide prisoners with the skills and preparation they need to succeed in society. This includes programs focused on mentorship and treatment for drug addiction and mental health issues, in addition to job training.<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>This month, we celebrate those who have exited the prison system and successfully reentered society. We encourage expanded opportunities for those who have worked to overcome bad decisions earlier in life and emphasize our belief in second chances for all who are willing to work hard to turn their lives around.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2018 as Second Chance Month. I call on all Americans to commemorate this month with events and activities that raise public awareness about preventing crime and providing those who have completed their sentences an opportunity for an honest second chance.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>World Autism Awareness Day is an opportunity to recognize and support all children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Today, millions of adults and an estimated 1 out of every 68 children in the United States have been diagnosed with some form of ASD. Notwithstanding these diagnoses, Americans with ASD make exceptional contributions across our Nation and around the world. On this day, we honor their accomplishments and recommit to ensuring that they enjoy the same opportunities to fulfill their potential that all Americans deserve.</FP>
  <FP>To maximize the quality of life across the entire autism spectrum, we must ensure that ASD is accurately identified and diagnosed in both children and adults. We must also support access to effective care, critical resources, and support services. To further these important goals, I was pleased to sign into law the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act, which will provide a national framework to support families as they care for loved ones with ASD and other similar conditions.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration also continues to focus on young adults with ASD. The Department of Health and Human Services, in accordance with the Autism CARES Act of 2014 and in coordination with other executive departments and agencies, has released a report that details services available for young people with ASD as they leave secondary education to help them transition to adulthood. In addition, the Department's Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee ensures robust engagement with people with ASD and their families to help inform policies and priorities. My Administration remains focused on this critical work and committed to advancing initiatives that improve the lives of those living with ASD.<PRTPAGE P="74"/>

  <FP>On World Autism Awareness Day, let us renew our commitment to support the entire international ASD community, including children and adults with ASD, their families, and caregivers.

  <FP>Fifty years ago today, on April 4, 1968, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was tragically assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. Though he was taken from this earth unjustly, he left us with his legacy of justice and peace. In remembrance of his profound and inspirational virtues, we look to do as Dr. King did while this world was privileged enough to still have him. We must learn to live together as brothers and sisters lest we perish together as fools. We must embrace the sanctity of life and love our neighbor as we love ourselves. As a united people, we must see Dr. King's life mission through and denounce racism, inhumanity, and all those things that seek to divide us.</FP>
  <FP>It is not government that will achieve Dr. King's ideals, but rather the people of this great country who will see to it that our Nation represents all that is good and true, and embodies unity, peace, and justice. We must actively aspire to secure the dream of living together as one people with a common purpose. President Abraham Lincoln sought to eradicate the senseless divisions of racial hierarchies when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Just over 100 years later, Dr. King continued this effort and called upon Americans to reject ugly impulses and prejudices, and to recognize the beauty and the humanity of all people, regardless of the color of their skin.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Year after year, millions of violent and property crimes occur in the United States. Each of these crimes has a victim. These victims can be left with serious physical and emotional wounds, and often with long-lasting, significant financial challenges. Even when victims receive assistance in the aftermath of these crimes, they may live in perpetual fear for their safety or continue to suffer ongoing financial setbacks. During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we renew our determination to hold criminals accountable for their actions and to reassure all crime victims that they are not alone.</FP>
  <FP>Across our Nation, thousands of dedicated advocates, healthcare professionals, private citizens, and criminal justice personnel strive to help victims as they move toward recovery and return to their lives. The Department of Justice (DOJ), through its Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), supports thousands of these local victim assistance programs. These programs provide many services, including mental health counseling and real-time crisis assistance, such as temporary housing, transportation, and civil legal assistance. OVC also supports State crime victim compensation programs, which help reimburse victims for medical, mental health, funeral, burial, and other expenses resulting from their experiences as victims of crime. Yet, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, only 42 percent of the victims of violent crime report the offense to police, and only 12 percent of victims of serious violence received services to assist them in the aftermath. Appropriate victim services from trained and qualified providers can transform lives. All those who diligently endeavor to console, heal, and support victims of crime deserve our gratitude and continued support.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration will continue to take a strong stance against crime in the United States. For example, DOJ's Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative has helped coordinate our efforts with State and local jurisdictions to restore public safety to our communities. In addition, earlier this year, I signed the SAFER Act of 2017, which strengthens and reauthorizes efforts to eliminate the nationwide rape kit backlog. If we can prosecute violent crimes more quickly and efficiently, we can help the victims of crime overcome their experiences and prevent others from suffering in the future.</FP>

  <FP>This week, we reaffirm our commitment to alleviate the burdens of crime victims, support those who serve these victims, and reduce the number of <PRTPAGE P="76"/>future victims by assisting law enforcement to keep our communities safe. Together, we can ensure a safe and prosperous future for all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since the days of the American Revolution, brave men and women have selflessly answered the call to protect and defend our great Nation. During the conflicts of the past two centuries, more than 500,000 United States service members have been captured and held as prisoners of war (POWs). National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day honors these American patriots, who each paid an extraordinary price to help preserve our liberty.</FP>
  <FP>This year commemorates several significant military anniversaries, including the centennial observance of the Armistice that ended World War I, the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Kasserine Pass in World War II, the 65th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War's Tet Offensive, and the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Mogadishu. Enemy forces captured and imprisoned American service members during each of these conflicts. During these battles, as with those throughout our Nation's history, military personnel carried out their missions undaunted by risk of capture or loss of life, because of their love for each other and their devotion to the principles of duty, honor, and justice.</FP>
  <FP>On this day, we pay homage to the courageous warriors who endured time in enemy hands and returned with honor to their families. During their capture, they faced loneliness, torture, hardship, separation from loved ones, and uncertainty about the future. In spite of unimaginable tribulations, these patriots persevered and survived. They are American heroes.</FP>

  <FP>Former POWs remain actively engaged in communities throughout our country. Their efforts help fellow veterans and their families cope with life after military service. In addition, their stories are a source of inspiration for current and future generations. Former POWs and loved ones of military personnel who have not returned from past conflicts share a unique connection. Few people can comprehend the emotional toll, the loss, and the pain of uncertainty the families of the fallen or captured endure better <PRTPAGE P="77"/>than former POWs. Their encouragement, understanding, and outreach helps ensure that their fallen and unaccounted-for comrades are not forgotten.</FP>
  <FP>As President, I remain committed to honoring and caring for former POWs. They have persevered through the harshest of conditions and, thankfully, have returned home to their loving families and a grateful Nation. They deserve our utmost reverence and respect.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2018, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day.

I also call upon Federal, State, and local government officials and organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Maintaining Enhanced Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety ThreatsBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In Proclamation 9645 of September 24, 2017 (Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats), I recognized that the United States has “developed a baseline for the kinds of information required from foreign governments to support the United States Government's ability to confirm the identity of individuals seeking entry into the United States as immigrants and nonimmigrants, as well as individuals applying for any other benefit under the immigration laws, and to assess whether they are a security or public-safety threat.” That baseline is designed to allow the United States to assess adequately whether foreign nationals from a particular country seeking to enter or apply for an immigration benefit from the United States pose a national security or public-safety threat. It also includes an assessment of any national security or public-safety risks that may emanate from a country's territory.</FP>

  <FP>After evaluating a comprehensive worldwide assessment of the performance of more than 200 countries against the baseline criteria, I placed entry suspensions and limitations on nationals of countries that failed to meet the baseline or whose nationals otherwise posed a significant threat. I also directed the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary), in consultation <PRTPAGE P="78"/>with the Secretary of State, to develop and implement a process to review whether countries have met the baseline criteria described in Proclamation 9645; develop recommendations regarding whether the suspensions and limitations should be continued, modified, terminated, or supplemented; and submit to me a report detailing these recommendations every 180 days. I further directed the Secretary of State to engage with countries subject to these entry restrictions in order to improve their performance against the baseline criteria, as practicable and appropriate, and consistent with the foreign policy, national security, and public-safety objectives of the United States. In taking these steps, I strengthened U.S. immigration vetting capabilities and processes, making our country safer. More work remains to be done, especially in light of evolving modern global threats, but we have made important progress.</FP>
  <FP>On March 30, 2018, the Secretary transmitted to me the first of the required reports. In the report, the Secretary recommended that the suspensions and limitations on the entry of foreign nationals from one country be terminated. The Secretary based this recommendation on the results of the review and engagement process developed with the Secretary of State. The review process consisted of three phases: (1) country data collection; (2) data review, analysis, and engagement; and (3) consultation with executive departments and agencies (agencies).</FP>
  <FP>During the data collection phase, the Department of State (State) surveyed all U.S. diplomatic missions worldwide on the performance of each country in meeting the baseline. For countries with deficiencies previously identified in the summer of 2017, missions provided their perspective on any steps taken to improve. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) simultaneously collected and reviewed relevant diplomatic, law enforcement, and intelligence reporting, along with data from other authoritative sources within the United States Government, intergovernmental organizations, and the public domain.</FP>
  <FP>During the data review, analysis, and engagement phase, DHS and State reviewed the information gathered, including survey responses from missions covering more than 200 countries, to determine whether each country's performance against the baseline criteria had improved, worsened, or remained the same. The review focused on any observed changes during the review period in a country's cooperation with the United States, as well as any indicators of potential deficiencies in satisfying the baseline. In cases in which survey responses from the U.S. missions required follow-up, DHS and State engaged with the missions and requested additional information. DHS and State also, as practicable and appropriate, verified each country's implementation of the criteria against other diplomatic, law enforcement, and intelligence reporting, and through authoritative sources of information external to the United States Government.</FP>

  <FP>DHS and State prioritized and, as practicable and appropriate, actively engaged those countries currently subject to travel restrictions in an effort to address and correct any deficiencies. U.S. missions abroad routinely engaged with their host governments, and DHS and State engaged with the pertinent foreign embassies in Washington, D.C. When a foreign government expressed interest in cooperating with the United States to address deficiencies, such discussions were supplemented by high-level meetings with appropriate U.S. officials and subject-matter experts. Through this <PRTPAGE P="79"/>process, for example, DHS and State organized a site visit to the Republic of Chad (Chad) in December 2017 to discuss specific deficiencies and potential remedies with relevant officials. Additionally, DHS met with the Libyan Foreign Minister to discuss Libya's ongoing efforts to comply with the baseline.</FP>
  <FP>Based on the information collected, DHS evaluated whether each country in the world is meeting the baseline criteria. If the information indicated a potential change in a country's performance, but the information was not sufficiently concrete, that country's compliance status was not adjusted. In such instances, DHS and State have treated such indicators as the basis for further evaluation during the next review period.</FP>
  <FP>DHS and State also identified certain developments or contextual indicators that would trigger further review of a country's performance to assess whether the country continues to meet information-sharing and identity-management criteria in a manner that mitigates any emerging risk, threat, or vulnerability. The goal of this evaluation was to ensure any recommendation to adjust current travel restrictions, either positively or negatively, would be grounded in articulable information and observations that demonstrate improved or degraded performance.</FP>
  <FP>The Secretary's review concluded that, while more work must be done, identity-management and information-sharing practices are improving globally. Countries have revived partnership negotiations with the United States that were long dormant; improved the fraud-deterring aspects of their passports; established new protocols for cooperating with U.S. visa-issuing consulates; and shared information on criminals, known or suspected terrorists, and lost and stolen passports.</FP>
  <FP>In Proclamation 9645, I imposed entry suspensions and limitations on the nationals of Chad. The Secretary has concluded that Chad has made marked improvements in its identity-management and information-sharing practices. Shortly after I signed the Proclamation, Chad made additional efforts to cooperate with the United States to help it satisfy the baseline. The United States worked closely with Chad to discuss the identity-management and information-sharing criteria. This endeavor included U.S. officials engaging with the Government of Chad to understand its domestic operations in significant detail in order to develop advice and guidance on how Chad could satisfy the baseline.</FP>

  <FP>Chad was receptive to this engagement and has made notable improvements. Specifically, Chad has improved its identity-management practices by taking concrete action to enhance travel document security for its nationals, including taking steps to issue more secure passports and sharing updated passport exemplars to help detect fraud. The Government of Chad also improved handling of lost and stolen passports, the sharing of which helps the United States and other nations prevent the fraudulent use of such documents. Additionally, the United States has confirmed that Chad shares information about known or suspected terrorists in a manner that makes that information available to our screening and vetting programs and has created a new, standardized process for processing requests for relevant criminal information. Chad has proven its commitment to sustaining cooperation with the United States through a regular review and coordination <PRTPAGE P="80"/>working group. This working group, which has met twice since Proclamation 9645 was issued, allows for regular tracking of the progress summarized above. In sum, Chad has made improvements and now sufficiently meets the baseline. I am therefore terminating the entry restrictions and limitations previously placed on the nationals of Chad.</FP>
  <FP>The Secretary determined that, despite our engagement efforts, other countries currently subject to entry restrictions and limitations did not make notable or sufficient improvements in their identity-management and information-sharing practices. Though remaining deficient, the State of Libya (Libya) is taking initial steps to improve its practices. DHS and State are currently working with the Government of Libya, which has designated a senior official in its Ministry of Foreign Affairs to serve as a central focal point for working with the United States. DHS and State presented Libya with a list of measures it can implement to rectify its deficiencies, and it has committed to do so. Despite this progress, Libya remains deficient in its performance against the baseline criteria, and the Secretary recommends at this time against removal of the entry restrictions and limitations on that country and the other countries currently subject to them.</FP>
  <FP>Finally, the Secretary found insufficient information that other countries' performance against the baseline criteria had degraded during the review period. In addition, DHS identified contextual indicators suggesting closer review of a country's practice was warranted in only one instance, and on closer examination, DHS determined that the country's practice did not warrant imposition of additional restrictions or limitations at this time.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, and during this week of remembrance, we reflect on one of the darkest periods in the history of the world and honor the victims of Nazi persecution. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, when the imprisoned Polish Jews mounted a courageous and extraordinary act of armed resistance against their Nazi guards.</FP>
  <FP>The Holocaust, known in Hebrew as “Shoah,” was the culmination of the Nazi regime's “Final Solution to the Jewish Question,” an attempt to eradicate the Jewish population in Europe. Although spearheaded by one individual, this undertaking could not have happened without the participation of many others who recruited, persuaded, and coerced in their efforts to incite the worst of human nature and carry out the ugliest of depravity. The abject brutality of the Nazi regime, coupled with the failure of Western leaders to confront the Nazis early on, created an environment that encouraged and enflamed anti-Semitic sentiment and drove people to engage in depraved, dehumanizing conduct.</FP>
  <FP>By the end, the Nazis and their conspirators had murdered 6 million men, women, and children, simply because they were Jews. They also persecuted and murdered millions of other Europeans, including Roma and Sinti Gypsies, persons with mental and physical disabilities, Slavs and other minorities, Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses, gays, and political dissidents.</FP>

  <FP>Let us continue to come together to remember all the innocent lives lost in the Holocaust, pay tribute to those intrepid individuals who resisted the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto, and recall those selfless heroes who risked their lives in order to help or save those of their persecuted neighbors. Their bravery inspires us to embrace all that is good about hope and resilience; their altruism reminds us of the importance of maintaining peace and unity, and of our civic duty never to remain silent or indifferent in <PRTPAGE P="82"/>the face of evil. We have a responsibility to convey the lessons of the Holocaust to future generations, and together as Americans, we have a moral obligation to combat antisemitism, confront hate, and prevent genocide. We must ensure that the history of the Holocaust remains forever relevant and that no people suffer these tragedies ever again.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby ask the people of the United States to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, April 12 through April 19, 2018, and the solemn anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, with appropriate study, prayers and commemoration, and to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution by internalizing the lessons of this atrocity so that it is never repeated.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we commemorate the 128th anniversary of the First International Conference of American States, which concluded on April 14, 1890, and paved the way for the establishment of the Organization of American States in 1948. As the Organization of American States celebrates the 70th anniversary of its founding this year, the United States reaffirms our commitment to partner with the nations of the Americas to advance security, economic and energy prosperity, and democratic governance throughout the hemisphere.</FP>
  <FP>This week, Vice President Pence will join with leaders in the Pan American region to address corruption and develop strategies to defeat transnational criminal organizations in our hemisphere. During the eighth Summit of the Americas, the United States will look to strengthen the region's collective commitment to representative democracy, to government accountability, and to confront threats to freedom.</FP>
  <FP>Tragically, the core tenets of free society have been abandoned in Venezuela and Cuba. Our hemispheric community of democracies must support the Venezuelan people and their right to have a voice in their government through free, fair, and internationally validated elections. Furthermore, the United States will not cease in its efforts to secure a future of freedom, peace, and prosperity for the people of Cuba.</FP>

  <FP>Under my Administration, the United States will continue to be a steady, enduring partner to Latin American and Caribbean countries. The United States will continue bilateral discussions on efforts to disrupt the organized crime organizations and trafficking routes that harm our citizens and drive <PRTPAGE P="83"/>irregular migration. My Administration supports ongoing regional security coordination through programs such as the Merida Initiative in Mexico, the Central American Regional Security Initiative, and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, as well as regular meetings, including our Strategic Dialogue to Disrupt Transnational Criminal Organizations with Mexico. At the heart of our engagement is the belief that by working together we can achieve a more prosperous and secure future for our region.</FP>
  <FP>As we observe Pan American Day and Pan American Week, let us capitalize on this momentum and build on our common history with a mutual purpose to achieve hemispheric peace and prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2018, as Pan American Day and April 8 through April 14, 2018, as Pan American Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of the other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Volunteer Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Volunteer Week, we recognize the millions of Americans who strengthen, enrich, and improve our communities through their tireless and selfless commitment to serving others. Those who dedicate their time, talent, and resources to positively influence the lives of others continue a legacy and tradition of service that began with our Founding Fathers and remains firmly enshrined in our national character today.</FP>
  <FP>Volunteers leave their mark on every facet of our neighborhoods and communities. Their work educates, equips, and empowers others. Some who volunteer as first responders risk rushing toward danger in order to help people during their times of greatest need. Others help children learn to read, tutor struggling students, provide services to the impoverished or elderly, and support our veterans and military families. Acting individually and through faith-based and other community organizations, volunteers help to bind us together as a Nation.</FP>

  <FP>America's volunteers are exceptional citizens and tremendous role models who demonstrate some of the finest qualities of the American people. Time and again we have seen America's compassionate, serving heart through the volunteer efforts of our people. Last year, for example, we saw the dedication and generosity of volunteers during Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and <PRTPAGE P="84"/>Maria, which harmed and displaced thousands of Americans. In the wake of such destruction and tragedy, heartening stories of unity, selflessness, and hope emerged. Americans from all walks of life put their lives on hold, and often on the line, to help people they had never met. They answered an urgent call and took action. These commendable individuals embody the very best of our country and our way of life. They remind us that even in our darkest days, goodness will prevail.</FP>
  <FP>During National Volunteer Week, we honor America's outstanding volunteers and their invaluable contributions to our Nation and the world. Because of their compassion and dedication, they are transforming communities and lives all across the country. I salute the men and women of all ages who mobilize each day to serve others, and I encourage all citizens to seek out opportunities to engage in volunteer service within their communities.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 15 through April 21, 2018, as National Volunteer Week.

  <FP>The magnificent coastlines, woodlands, plains, mountains, deserts, and historical and cultural monuments of our national parks inspire and exhilarate us. During National Park Week, we celebrate America's extraordinary landscapes and landmarks as we launch a new era of preservation to protect them for future generations.</FP>
  <FP>Our national parks demonstrate the power of nature and tell the scenic story of America. Last year, more than 330 million people visited the 417 areas included in the national park system. From the steep red cliffs and heavenly valleys of Zion to the towering majesty of the Statue of Liberty, America's national parks have something for everyone. Families bond over campfires; adventurers test their courage ascending intense rock formations; veterans find serenity in healing vistas; students watch history come to life at famous battle sites; and recreationists enjoy some of the most beautiful settings on earth.</FP>
  <FP>America's special places bring out the freedom-loving, pioneering spirit of America, and they deserve our care and attention. My Administration is spearheading new initiatives to revitalize our national parks and to ensure that they continue to set the conservation standard for the rest of the world. We are working with the Congress to establish a Public Lands Infrastructure Fund, which would use revenues from certain energy production activities to help reduce the backlog of maintenance requirements in the national park system and in other programs administered by the Department of the Interior. My Administration is also enlisting park supporters, through public-private partnerships, to invest in significant upgrades to our Nation's most visible and visited public lands. Improving our trails, roads, bridges, buildings, campgrounds, and services will protect our natural and cultural heritage for many years to come.</FP>
  <FP>Support for our national parks is strong and growing. Thousands of volunteers and partners work with the National Park Service to expand visitation, preserve sites, encourage the appropriate use of resources, and extend the economic benefits of parks into nearby communities. We must continue our efforts to preserve our natural and historic sites in order to maintain the splendor of our country for future generations.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">World Intellectual Property Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On World Intellectual Property Day, we not only celebrate invention and innovation, but also we recognize how integral intellectual property rights are to our Nation's economic competitiveness. Intellectual property rights support the arts, sciences, and technology. They also create the framework for a competitive market that leads to higher wages and more jobs for everyone. The United States is committed to protecting the intellectual property rights of our companies and ensuring a level playing field in the world economy for our Nation's creators, inventors, and entrepreneurs.</FP>
  <FP>Our country will no longer turn a blind eye to the theft of American jobs, wealth, and intellectual property through the unfair and unscrupulous economic practices of some foreign actors. These practices are harmful not only to our Nation's businesses and workers but to our national security as well. Intellectual property theft is estimated to cost our economy as much as $600 billion a year. To protect our economic and national security, I have directed Federal agencies to aggressively respond to the theft of American intellectual property. In combatting this intellectual property theft, and in enforcing fair and reciprocal trade policy, we will protect American jobs and promote global innovation.</FP>
  <FP>While we continue to demand the protection of intellectual property rights abroad, my Administration will also take steps to strengthen our patent system here at home. A system that increases the reliability and enforceability of patents will encourage even more investment in creative and innovative industries, leading to job and wealth creation for all Americans. When the United States advances pro-growth policies of this form, we set an example of protecting economic competitiveness, promoting new engines of growth, and prioritizing the expansion of innovative and creative capacities overall.</FP>

  <FP>This year's World Intellectual Property Day is dedicated to celebrating all of the industrious and brilliant women who have changed, and who continue to change, the world with their inventions, innovations, and other creative contributions to society. Our Nation's economic strength and prosperity would not be so without the over 75 million women in our country's workforce, whose ingenuity, initiative, and hard work have helped foster <PRTPAGE P="87"/>the growth and progress of America's economy since our formation. Over the past decade, the number of women-owned firms has grown five times faster than the national average for all firms. American women are assuming leading roles in health, business and finance, the arts, and the STEM fields. We must protect the intellectual property rights of these women creators, inventors, and entrepreneurs in order to promote further innovation for years to come.</FP>
  <FP>A new era of American exceptionalism is dawning, in the form of sustained intellectual property rights and continued American entrepreneurship. The drive for excellence, advancement, and innovation in the United States has brought forth significant discoveries, developed life-saving research, and improved the quality of life for millions of Americans. On this World Intellectual Property Day, we celebrate the creative spirit and contributions of American men and women, and we acknowledge the necessity of maintaining intellectual property rights for all those enterprising individuals who dare to invent or create something new for the betterment of all people.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 26, 2018, as World Intellectual Property Day. I encourage Americans to observe this day with events and educational programs that celebrate the benefits of intellectual property to our economy and our country.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Small Business Week, we recognize the ingenuity of the American spirit and the renewed promise of the American Dream. America is a country of innovators, entrepreneurs, and builders. Our Nation's strength is derived from our people's initiative and desire to create a better tomorrow for our country through hard work and determination.</FP>

  <FP>Small businesses are at the heart of our Nation. Our country's 30 million small businesses employ nearly 58 million Americans—48 percent of the labor force. Each year, small businesses create two-out-of-three net new, private-sector jobs in the United States. For this reason, my Administration worked with the Congress to enact a tax relief plan that provides small businesses with hundreds of billions in additional tax cuts. Moreover, we remain focused on eliminating unnecessary and unduly burdensome regulations, which hurt hardworking Americans. Across the Nation, we are enabling entrepreneurs to invest more of their time and hard-earned profits <PRTPAGE P="88"/>into growing their businesses and delivering better value for American consumers.</FP>
  <FP>As we usher in a new era of American prosperity, my Administration will continue to implement a pro-growth agenda based on policies that champion small business creation and growth, giving more Americans the opportunity to start, scale, and succeed in businesses of their own. We will ensure trade deals are fair and reciprocal, cutting the barriers that prevent American producers from selling their products abroad. We are protecting our economic interests and intellectual property by investing in our Nation's cybersecurity, making sure our workforce has the education, skills, and training that small business owners demand, and investing in our country's infrastructure to improve productivity and the ability to transport goods and services.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we celebrate all the entrepreneurs who have taken a risk to start and grow a small business. They are driven by a belief that they can do something better, smarter, and more efficient than what has been done before. They make our neighborhoods vibrant places to live and work. They invest in their neighbors and employ millions of Americans. When they succeed, we all succeed.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 29 through May 5, 2018, as Small Business Week.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Jewish American Heritage Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Jewish American Heritage Month, we celebrate the profound contributions that the Jewish faith and its traditions have had on our Nation. Two hundred years ago, in April 1818, Mordecai Noah delivered his famous discourse before the members of America's first synagogue, Congregation Shearith Israel, upon the consecration of their new house of worship. Reflecting on Jewish history as well as on the unique rights and privileges afforded to American Jews, Noah proclaimed that, “for the first time in eighteen centuries, it may be said that the Jew feels he was born equal, and is entitled to equal protection; he can now breathe freely.”</FP>

  <FP>Jewish Americans have helped guide the moral character of our Nation. They have maintained a strong commitment to engage deeply in American <PRTPAGE P="89"/>society while also preserving their historic values and traditions. Their passion for social justice and showing kindness to strangers is rooted in the beliefs that God created all people in his image and that we all deserve dignity and peace. These beliefs have inspired Jewish Americans to build mutual-support societies, hospitals, and educational institutions that have enabled them and their fellow Americans to advance American society. Jewish Americans marched for civil rights in Selma and fought for the freedom of their brethren behind the Iron Curtain. Through their actions, they have made the world a better place.</FP>
  <FP>The contributions of the Jewish people to American society are innumerable, strengthening our Nation and making it more prosperous. American Jews have proudly served our country in all branches of government, from local to Federal, and they have defended our freedom while serving in the United States Armed Forces. The indelible marks that American Jews have left on literature, music, cinema, and the arts have enriched the American soul. In their enduring tradition of generosity, Jewish Americans have established some of the largest philanthropic and volunteer networks in the Nation, providing humanitarian aid and social services to those in need at home and abroad, acting as a “light unto the nations.” Universities and other institutions around the country proudly display Nobel prizes won by Jewish Americans in the fields of medicine, chemistry, physics, and economics.</FP>
  <FP>In reaction to Mordecai Noah's 1818 discourse, Thomas Jefferson wrote that American laws protect “our religious as they do our civil rights by putting all on an equal footing.” The American Jewish community is a shining example of how enshrining freedom of religion and protecting the rights of minorities can strengthen a nation. Through their rich culture and heritage, the Jewish people have triumphed over adversity and enhanced our country. For this and many other reasons, the American Jewish community is deserving of our respect, recognition, and gratitude.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2018 as Jewish American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the heritage and contributions of American Jews and to observe this month with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Law Day, U.S.A., 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>On Law Day, we celebrate our Nation's heritage of liberty, justice, and equality under the law. This heritage is embodied most powerfully in our <PRTPAGE P="90"/>Constitution, the longest surviving document of its kind. The Constitution established a unique structure of government that has ensured to our country the blessings of liberty through law for nearly 229 years.</FP>
  <FP>The Framers of our Constitution created a government with distinct and independent branches—the Legislative, the Executive, and the Judicial—because they recognized the risks of concentrating power in one authority. As James Madison wrote, “the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” By separating the powers of government into three co-equal branches and giving each branch certain powers to check the others, the Constitution provides a framework in which the rule of law has flourished.</FP>
  <FP>The importance of the rule of law can be seen throughout our Nation's history. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to our Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits States from denying persons the equal protection of the laws or depriving them of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The commitment to the rule of law that led the country to ratify that Amendment was no less powerful than the commitment to the rule of law that led the country to ratify the original Constitution.</FP>
  <FP>That commitment to the rule of law lives on today. It drives the debates we see around the country about the growth of the administrative state and regulatory authority, and about the unfortunate trend of district court rulings that exceed traditional limits on the judicial power. We also see that commitment in the people's demand that their representatives comply with the Constitution, and in the Representatives and Senators themselves who take seriously their oaths to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>President Dwight D. Eisenhower first commemorated Law Day in 1958 to celebrate our Nation's roots in the principles of liberty and guaranteed fundamental rights of individual citizens under the law. Law Day recognizes that we govern ourselves in accordance with the rule of law rather according to the whims of an elite few or the dictates of collective will. Through law, we have ensured liberty. We should not, and do not, take that success for granted. On this 60th annual observance of Law Day, let us rededicate ourselves to the rule of law as the best means to secure, as the Preamble to our Constitution so wisely states, “the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2018, as Law Day, U.S.A. I urge all Americans, including government officials, to observe this day by reflecting upon the importance of the rule of law in our Nation and displaying the flag of the United States in support of this national observance; and I especially urge the legal profession, the press, and the radio, television, and media industries to promote and to participate in the observance of this day.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent have contributed immeasurably to our Nation's development and diversity as a people. During Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we recognize their tremendous contributions, which have helped strengthen our communities, industries, Armed Forces, national security, and institutions of governance. Through their industriousness and love of country, our Nation has enjoyed the privileges and enrichments of multiple innovations and societal advancements.</FP>
  <FP>Indian American Kalpana Chawla was the first woman of Indian descent to fly in space, and became an American hero for her devotion to the Space Shuttle program and its various missions transporting cargo and crew to and from the International Space Station. For her achievements, the Congress posthumously awarded her the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) posthumously awarded her the NASA Space Flight Medal and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. Ms. Chawla's courage and passion continue to serve as an inspiration for millions of American girls who dream of one day becoming astronauts. Susan Ahn Cuddy, who was the daughter of the first Korean couple to immigrate to the United States, also uplifted the Nation through strong work ethic, an unwavering love of country, and a steadfast devotion to her life mission, even in the face of great adversity. She was the first Asian-American woman to join the U.S. Navy. During World War II, she excelled as a code breaker and became the first female aerial gunnery officer in the Naval Forces. Lieutenant Cuddy would go on to further serve her country as an intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency.</FP>
  <FP>America is a country that values hard work, an honest living, and a commitment to the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For these reasons, America cherishes its connections with the Indo-Pacific region, which shares an appreciation for these principles. Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage help to reinforce these relationships, which are stronger today than ever before. As President, I have visited and renewed ties with countries from which many proud Americans hail, including Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. During my visits to these countries, I shared my vision for continued prosperity, peace, and security through a free and open Indo-Pacific region. It is clear that a renewed sense of our common purpose and goals has consolidated and strengthened our economic, cultural, and security relationships.</FP>

  <FP>This month, and every month, we honor the more than 20 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who call America home, including those living in Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and we salute those who have served and are currently serving our Nation in the Armed Forces.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Foster Care Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Foster Care Month, we reflect on the dedication of foster and kinship caregivers, faith-based and community organizations, and child welfare professionals who are improving the lives of children and youth in foster care throughout the country. Our Nation is deeply indebted to these selfless and compassionate Americans. We also observe this month, with sadness, the plight of innocent children who are in foster care because their lives have been disrupted by neglect or abuse.</FP>
  <FP>Providing a stable, secure, and nurturing home environment is one of the greatest gifts a foster parent or guardian can give a child. This critical investment in their well-being, safety, and sense of belonging brings precious hope to children in need. We acknowledge, with gratitude, the tremendous sacrifices made by our Nation's foster families as they open their hearts and lives and provide secure and supportive homes for the hundreds of thousands of infants, children, and youth in foster care.</FP>
  <FP>We also take this opportunity to acknowledge that there is still much more we can do to prevent the abuse and neglect that forces children into foster care placements. For the fourth consecutive year, the number of children placed in foster care has increased, driven in part by the opioid crisis and drug abuse. My Administration is dedicated to bringing help and healing to families threatened by addiction so that parents and children can stay together in a safe and stable home environment.</FP>

  <FP>In February, I signed into law the Family First Prevention Services Act, a law that aims to keep children at home and out of foster care by allowing States to use matching funds from the Federal Government for substance abuse prevention and treatment, mental health services, family counseling, and parenting-skills training. When it becomes necessary to place children or youth in foster care, this new law gives States incentives to reduce the placement of children in congregate care in favor of more desirable family atmospheres.<PRTPAGE P="93"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>We are blessed that our country is filled with generous individuals and families who willingly welcome children in need into their homes so that they can experience loving guardianship and some of the joys of family life. Many of these heroic families provide foster care for children with complex medical and challenging psychological and behavioral needs. This month is an opportunity to raise awareness about the increasing number of children and youth entering foster care and to encourage Americans to invest in the lives of some of our Nation's most vulnerable children and families.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2018 as National Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking time to help children and youth in foster care, and to recognize the commitment of those who touch their lives, particularly celebrating their foster parents and other caregivers.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Mental Health Awareness Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During the month of May, we observe National Mental Health Awareness Month and reaffirm our commitment to improving the overall health and well-being of our Nation. America has made tremendous strides in providing treatment and recovery support services for individuals who experience mental illnesses. Yet sadly, stigma and misconceptions about mental illness persist. The negative stereotypes surrounding mental illness deter people who may experience these disorders from getting help that can improve their lives and their ability to achieve their full potential.</FP>

  <FP>Approximately one in five Americans experiences a mental illness, yet only about one third of them will access treatment. For this reason, my fiscal year 2019 budget request to the Congress includes $10 billion in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic and address serious mental illness. This funding will improve access to evidence-based treatment services for those who are seriously mentally ill. My budget also requests new funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to ensure more adults with serious mental illness receive Assertive Community Treatment, an evidence-based practice that provides a comprehensive array of services to reduce costly hospitalizations. Additionally, my budget maintains funding for the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, which helps ensure that individuals with serious mental illness receive appropriate treatment in a timely manner. Further, it includes new targeted investments to help divert individuals with serious mental illnesses from <PRTPAGE P="94"/>the criminal justice system and into treatment. Finally, it funds important suicide prevention activities.</FP>
  <FP>As part of an ongoing effort to improve the quality and availability of treatment for people with mental illnesses in our healthcare systems, I appointed the first Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use to ensure that all agencies are working together to increase access to the best treatment and recovery services possible. This will accelerate research and innovation through the Department of Health and Human Services and other executive departments and agencies. Additionally, we have launched the inaugural Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee, which will improve the lives of individuals and families who have been affected by serious mental illness. This Committee will coordinate services across multiple agencies and will serve as a national model to improve access to evidence-based treatment and services most needed by persons with severe mental illness or those who are seriously disturbed emotionally.</FP>
  <FP>This month, and always, we pledge to strive to eliminate the stigma of mental illness by increasing awareness for all Americans that these illnesses are common and treatable, and that recovery is possible. Through these efforts, our neighbors, co-workers, family, and friends affected by mental illness will know that there is hope for recovery and hope for healthier, more productive lives.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim May 2018 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to support citizens suffering from mental illness, raise awareness of mental health conditions through appropriate programs and activities, and commit our Nation to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Older Americans Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>During Older Americans Month, we recognize and celebrate those Americans who have spent decades providing for the next generation and building the greatness of our Nation. Our country and our communities are strong today because of the care and dedication of our elders. Their unique perspectives and experiences have endowed us with valuable wisdom and guidance, and we commit to learning from them and ensuring their safety and comfort.<PRTPAGE P="95"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Older Americans play critical roles in helping support their adult children, grandchildren, and extended families. They work and volunteer for businesses and organizations that drive our economy and serve our communities. Most importantly, our senior citizens mentor future generations and instill core American values in them. Their guidance preserves our heritage and the invaluable lessons of the past.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is focused on the priorities of our Nation's seniors. The Department of Justice, for example, is focused on protecting seniors from fraud and abuse. My Administration is also committed to protecting the Social Security system so that seniors who have contributed to the system can receive benefits from it. We are also dedicated to improving healthcare, including by increasing the quality of care our veterans receive through the Department of Veterans Affairs and by lowering prescription drug prices for millions of Americans.</FP>
  <FP>As a Nation, we are grateful to older Americans for all they have done to build up and sustain our families and communities. Senior citizens deserve to be treated with respect, to have their needs met, and to age with dignity. This month, we recommit ourselves to ensure that older Americans are able to navigate financial and physical obstacles that could stand in the way of joyful and meaningful golden years.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2018 as Older Americans Month. I call upon all Americans to honor our elders, acknowledge their contributions, care for those in need, and reaffirm our country's commitment to older Americans this month and throughout the year.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we renew our commitment to living healthier and more active lifestyles, and acknowledge the positive difference that sports make in our society. Setting time aside each day to exercise improves both mental health and overall quality of life. In addition to the health benefits, participation in sports builds good character, teaches the value of teamwork, reinforces self-discipline, and promotes leadership.</FP>

  <FP>Involvement in both team and individual sports offers countless benefits to the general well-being of children, allowing them to gain knowledge of the <PRTPAGE P="96"/>connection between effort and success, and enhancing their academic, economic, and social prospects. Studies have shown that children who are involved in sports have greater self-discipline, higher self-esteem, and are better at working with others. They are also more likely to attend college and less likely to commit a crime or suffer from mental or physical health problems. Similar research suggests that individuals who have participated in sports are more likely to excel in the workplace and earn higher wages than their peers who did not compete in athletics.</FP>
  <FP>In recent years, unfortunately, America has seen a decline in youth sports participation, particularly among young girls and children from economically distressed areas. For this reason, in February, I signed an Executive Order regarding sports, fitness, and nutrition. The order establishes a Presidential council focused on the critical importance of sports in increasing the physical fitness and positive life outcomes of our Nation's youth. This council is charged with identifying ways to expand access to youth sports and ensuring American children from all zip codes can compete if they desire. The Executive Order emphasizes my Administration's commitment to encouraging youth sports participation throughout the United States, so that we can strengthen the next generation of American leaders and lift up our communities.</FP>
  <FP>Routine physical activity also offers extraordinary health benefits for individuals of all ages. Engaging in regular physical activity can reduce risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and even certain types of cancers. It also builds bone and muscle strength, reducing the risk of injuries. In children six years and older, regular engagement in 60 minutes or more of physical activity per day has been shown to lower the risk of obesity, while improving heart, muscular, and bone health. A routine exercise plan can even assist in reducing symptoms of depression and improving mental health. Therefore, I encourage all Americans to develop and maintain a physical fitness plan that helps them fulfill their fitness goals and achieve a healthier overall lifestyle.</FP>
  <FP>At the root of a healthy America are healthy citizens. This month, we celebrate and promote the benefits of physical activity and recognize those selfless individuals who volunteer their time and resources to make it possible for our Nation's youth to participate in sports programs. I encourage all Americans to find a sport or to adopt an exercise routine that allows them to reap the numerous benefits of an active lifestyle. Together, we can invest in a healthier and stronger America.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2018 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United States to make physical activity and sports participation a priority in their lives.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Loyalty Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Loyalty Day, we reflect with humility and gratitude upon the freedoms we hold dear, and we reaffirm our allegiance to our Nation and its founding principles. We cherish our system of self-government, whereby each American citizen is free to exercise their God-given and inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We honor and defend our Constitution, which constrains the power of government and allows us freely to exercise these rights. We also recognize the great responsibility that accompanies a free people and vow to preserve our hard-won liberty. For we know, as President Ronald Reagan once said, that “freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”</FP>
  <FP>This Loyalty Day, we remember and honor the thousands of Americans who have laid down their lives to protect and defend our Nation's beautiful flag, from those who battled on Bunker Hill to those who sailed at Midway. These brave men and women fought and died to ensure that the United States of America continues to shine as a beacon of hope and freedom around the world. America's light will continue to shine because our Government is built on the propositions that government derives its just power from the consent of the governed and that government exists for the purpose of protecting the individual rights of its citizens. This makes our Nation exceptional. Through devotion and sacrifice, each new generation has preserved these rights for posterity. It now falls to us to continue this legacy.</FP>
  <FP>As we have since our Nation's founding, Americans today continue to strengthen the fabric of our Nation. The men and women of our Armed Forces courageously confront our enemies, who seek to do us harm and to destroy our way of life. Our first responders valiantly rush toward danger to save lives and aid those in need, often at great personal risk. Parents and teachers prepare our youth to defend our unique heritage and our rights. Our Nation's entrepreneurs and business owners are rewarded by how well they serve others—a remarkable feature of our free market system. The valued virtue of selfless service that permeates American life exemplifies our proud loyalty to our country and fellow citizens.</FP>
  <FP>To express our country's loyalty to individual liberties, to limited government, and to the inherent dignity of every human being, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as “Loyalty Day.” On this day, we honor the United States of America and those who uphold its values, particularly those who have fought and continue to fight to defend the freedom our Constitution affords us.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2018, as Loyalty Day. I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies in our schools and other public places, including recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America. I also call upon all Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings and grounds on that day.<PRTPAGE P="98"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>
  <FP>3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted the continuing discussions with the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from those countries. Recognizing that each of these countries and the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, I determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 until May 1, 2018.</FP>

  <FP>4. The United States has agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imported from <PRTPAGE P="99"/>these countries. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil is to extend the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, in order to finalize the details of these satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imported from these countries. In my judgment, and for the reasons I stated in paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9710, these discussions will be most productive if aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil remain exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, until the details can be finalized and implemented by proclamation. Because the United States has agreed in principle with these countries, in my judgment, it is unnecessary to set an expiration date for the exemptions. Nevertheless, if the satisfactory alternative means are not finalized shortly, I will consider re-imposing the tariff.</FP>
  <FP>5. The United States is continuing discussions with Canada, Mexico, and the EU. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to extend the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, at least at this time. In my judgment, and for the reasons I stated in paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9710, these discussions will be most productive if aluminum articles from these countries remain exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704.</FP>
  <FP>6. For the reasons I stated in paragraph 11 of Proclamation 9710, however, the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 remains an important first step in ensuring the economic stability of our domestic aluminum industry and removing the threatened impairment of the national security. As a result, unless I determine by further proclamation that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU, the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these countries.</FP>
  <FP>7. I have determined that, in light of the ongoing discussions that may result in long-term exclusions from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.</FP>
  <FP>8. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>9. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, <PRTPAGE P="100"/>and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
  <P>(1) Imports of all aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil shall be exempt from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by clause 1 of Proclamation 9710. Imports of all aluminum articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU shall be exempt from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018. Further, clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by clause 1 of Proclamation 9710, is also amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following two sentences: “Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all aluminum articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union, (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the European Union, and (c) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. This rate of duty, which is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum articles from each country as specified in the preceding sentence.”</P>
  <P>(2) The exemption afforded to aluminum articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU shall apply only to aluminum articles of such countries entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, through the close of May 31, 2018, at which time such countries shall be deleted from the article description of heading 9903.85.01 of the HTSUS.</P>
  <P>(3) Clause 5 of Proclamation 9710 is amended by inserting the phrase “, except those eligible for admission under “domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which is subject to the duty imposed pursuant to Proclamation 9704, as amended by Proclamation 9710,” after the words “Any aluminum article” in the first and second sentences.</P>
  <P>(4) Aluminum articles shall not be subject upon entry for consumption to the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by clause 1 of this proclamation, merely by reason of manufacture in a U.S. foreign trade zone. However, aluminum articles admitted to a U.S. foreign trade zone in “privileged foreign status” pursuant to clause 5 of Proclamation 9710, as amended by clause 3 of this proclamation, shall retain that status consistent with 19 CFR 146.41(e).</P>
  <P>(5) No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed on any aluminum article pursuant to Proclamation 9704, as amended by clause 1 of this proclamation.</P>

  <P>(6) The Secretary, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to <PRTPAGE P="101"/>the amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>
  </P>
  <P>(7) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel mill articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of steel mill articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States) (steel articles), by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>
  <FP>3. In Proclamation 9711, I noted the continuing discussions with the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of steel articles from those countries. Recognizing that each of these countries and the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, I determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of steel articles from these countries was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt steel articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 until May 1, 2018.</FP>

  <FP>4. The United States has successfully concluded discussions with South Korea on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by steel articles imports from South Korea. The United States and South Korea have agreed on a range of measures, including measures to reduce excess steel production and excess steel capacity, and measures that will contribute to increased capacity utilization in the United States, including a quota that restricts the quantity of steel articles imported into the United States from South Korea. In my judgment, <PRTPAGE P="105"/>these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address South Korea's contribution to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining steel articles exports to the United States from South Korea, limiting transshipment, and discouraging excess capacity and excess steel production. In light of this agreement, I have determined that steel articles imports from South Korea will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude South Korea from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the quota and other measures agreed upon with South Korea in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.</FP>
  <FP>5. The United States has agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by steel articles imported from these countries. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of steel articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil is to extend the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, in order to finalize the details of these satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by steel articles imported from these countries. In my judgment, and for the reasons I stated in paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9711, these discussions will be most productive if steel articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil remain exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, until the details can be finalized and implemented by proclamation. Because the United States has agreed in principle with these countries, in my judgment, it is unnecessary to set an expiration date for the exemptions. Nevertheless, if the satisfactory alternative means are not finalized shortly, I will consider re-imposing the tariff.</FP>
  <FP>6. The United States is continuing discussions with Canada, Mexico, and the EU. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of steel articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to extend the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, at least at this time.

As a result, unless I determine by further proclamation that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of steel articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU, the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these countries.</FP>

  <FP>8. In light of my determination to exclude, on a long-term basis, South Korea from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff set forth in <PRTPAGE P="106"/>clause 2 of Proclamation 9705 as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of the agreed-upon quota and other measures with South Korea, the measures being finalized with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil, and the ongoing discussions that may result in further long-term exclusions from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.</FP>
  <FP>9. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
  <P>(1) Imports of all steel articles from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea shall be exempt from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 1 of Proclamation 9711. Imports of all steel articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU shall be exempt from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705 until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018. Further, clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 1 of Proclamation 9711, is also amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following two sentences: “Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union, and (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea. This rate of duty, which is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported steel articles, shall apply to imports of steel articles from each country as specified in the preceding sentence.”.</P>

  <P>(2) In order to provide the quota treatment referred to in paragraph 4 of this proclamation to steel articles imports from South Korea, U.S. Note 16 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended as provided for in Part A of the Annex to this proclamation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security shall implement this quota as soon as practicable, taking into account all steel articles imports from South Korea since January 1, 2018.<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
  </P>
  <P>(3) The exemption afforded to steel articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU shall apply only to steel articles of such countries entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, through the close of May 31, 2018, at which time such countries shall be deleted from the article description of heading 9903.80.01 of the HTSUS.</P>
  <P>(4) Clause 5 of Proclamation 9711 is amended by inserting the phrase “, except those eligible for admission under “domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which is subject to the duty imposed pursuant to Proclamation 9705, as amended by Proclamation 9711,” after the words “Any steel article” in the first and second sentences.</P>
  <P>(5) Steel articles shall not be subject upon entry for consumption to the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 1 of this proclamation, merely by reason of manufacture in a U.S. foreign trade zone. However, steel articles admitted to a U.S. foreign trade zone in “privileged foreign status” pursuant to clause 5 of Proclamation 9711, as amended by clause 4 of this proclamation, shall retain that status consistent with 19 CFR 146.41(e).</P>
  <P>(6) No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed on any steel article pursuant to Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 1 of this proclamation.</P>

  <P>(7) The Secretary, in consultation with CBP and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>
  </P>
  <P>(8) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.DONALD J. TRUMP</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Day of Prayer, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On this National Day of Prayer, we join together to offer gratitude for our many blessings and to acknowledge our need for divine wisdom, guidance, and protection. Prayer, by which we affirm our dependence on God, has long been fundamental to our pursuit of freedom, peace, unity, and prosperity. Prayer sustains us and brings us comfort, hope, peace, and strength. Therefore, we must cherish our spiritual foundation and uphold our legacy of faith.</FP>
  <FP>Prayer has been a source of guidance, strength, and wisdom since the founding of our Republic. When the Continental Congress gathered in Philadelphia to contemplate freedom from Great Britain, the delegates prayed daily for guidance. Their efforts produced the Declaration of Independence and its enumeration of the self-evident truths that we all cherish today. We believe that all men and women are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Prayer sustained us and gave us the strength to endure the sacrifices and suffering of the American Revolution and to temper the triumph of victory with humility and gratitude. Notably, as one of its first acts, our newly formed Congress appointed chaplains of the House of Representatives and Senate so that all proceedings would begin with prayer.</FP>
  <FP>As a Nation, we have continued to seek God in prayer, including in times of conflict and darkness. At the height of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for prayer “for the vision to see our way clearly—to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men—and to the achievement of His will to peace on earth.” Decades later, following one of the darkest days in our Nation's history, President George W. Bush offered this prayer for our heartbroken country, mourning the precious souls who perished in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: “We ask Almighty God to watch over our Nation, and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that He will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank Him for each life we now must mourn, and the promise of a life to come.”</FP>
  <FP>America has known peace, prosperity, war, and depression—and prayer has sustained us through it all. May our Nation and our people never forget the love, grace, and goodness of our Maker, and may our praise and gratitude never cease. On this National Day of Prayer, let us come together, all according to their faiths, to thank God for His many blessings and ask for His continued guidance and strength.</FP>

  <FP>In 1988, the Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a National Day of Prayer, “on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals.”<PRTPAGE P="128"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 3 as a National Day of Prayer. I encourage all Americans to observe this day, reflecting on the blessings our Nation has received and the importance of prayer, with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in their houses of worship, communities, and places of work, schools, and homes.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Charter Schools Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The first public charter school opened its doors in Saint Paul, Minnesota, 26 years ago. Wanting to offer families more high-quality education options, it was founded to promote accountability and innovation, and to advance academic achievement. Now, 44 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing the creation of charter schools, which are responsible for educating millions of students nationwide. During National Charter Schools Week, we celebrate the more than 7,000 charter schools across our country, their teachers and administrators, and the students they serve.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has prioritized support for charter schools so that more students have access to this valuable academic option. In my fiscal year 2019 budget request, I called on the Congress to increase funding for the Federal Charter Schools Program to $500 million. This program strengthens State and local efforts to create and expand charter schools to help meet the growing demand for this educational option and increase charter schools' access to high-quality facilities.</FP>
  <FP>Each child is blessed with unique talents and learns in different ways. Charter schools enhance educational options for families and empower teachers to explore innovative programs, alternative curricula, and creative approaches to education to ensure that they meet their students' individual needs. Charter schools provide educators the flexibility to equip students with knowledge and skills that give them the opportunity to achieve their academic goals and pursue successful careers.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we acknowledge the critical role charter schools play in providing students with rigorous education that holds them to high standards. A great education is the foundation for a better future for students facing the demands and challenges of the 21st century. As a Nation, we should continue to support and address their dreams in their innovative efforts to help students reach their full potential.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and <PRTPAGE P="129"/>the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6 through May 12, 2018, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's successful public charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to help students and empower parents and families by supporting high-quality charter schools as an important school choice option.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, I encourage everyone in hurricane-prone areas to make all necessary preparations for the 2018 hurricane season, which starts this month in the Eastern Pacific and next month in the Atlantic and Central Pacific. Hurricanes threaten the lives of those in their paths and can cause serious damage to homes, businesses, and communities. Having just endured last year one of the most tragic and destructive hurricane seasons in our history, we know all too well the critical need to be prepared to prevent and mitigate hurricane-related harm.</FP>
  <FP>Last year, three hurricanes of Category 4 or higher intensity tragically inflicted immense damage on our communities when they made landfall in the United States and its territories. These three landfalls occurred within less than a month of each other, claiming lives and affecting millions of Americans. Hurricane Harvey's record-breaking rainfall and flooding caused nearly $125 billion of damage to southeastern Texas and Louisiana, making it the second most costly storm on record. It was also the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the United States or its territories since 2004. Not long after, another Category 4 storm, Hurricane Irma slammed into Florida and Puerto Rico. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Maria, the 10th most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, devastated Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Federal support to those affected by the 2017 hurricane season was extensive, as the Government delivered the largest ever disaster relief package to States and territories in need.</FP>

  <FP>The incredibly active hurricane season of 2017 showed us the various ways hurricanes can affect lives and property. Storm surges can spread miles inland from the coastline, claiming lives and destroying property. Torrential rainfall, from both hurricanes and storms surrounding them, can cause deadly and hazardous urban and river flooding that reaches far inland. Winds can likewise cause significant property damage over large areas. Other hurricane-related events, like tornadoes, can affect communities well beyond the storm's path. Even if those hurricanes stay hundreds of miles offshore, they can cause harm by generating dangerous waves and rip currents in coastal areas.<PRTPAGE P="130"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Being prepared is the key to minimizing hurricane-related harm. Everyone should take steps now to prepare for this hurricane season. This includes developing plans to stay current about the latest weather developments. Last year, I signed the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, which strengthens our weather forecasting capabilities. I am proud that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is well underway in implementing this Act and on the path to producing the best weather forecasting model in the world.</FP>

  <FP>As hurricane season begins, we must remind ourselves that there are no substitutes for having emergency supplies and a well-prepared emergency plan in place. Before this year's hurricane season begins, take the time to sign up for emergency alerts, make plans for shelter and evacuation, gather supplies for your emergency kit, check your insurance coverage and document your property, strengthen your financial preparedness, harden your home, and develop a plan to keep in touch with your loved ones. Hurricane preparedness information provided by the National Weather Service and the <E T="03">Ready Campaign</E> led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is available online and can help you to develop your plan today so that you can properly safeguard yourself, your family, pets, and property in the event of a hurricane.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration continues to help the areas hit by last year's hurricanes recover and become more resilient against future storms. Yet, ensuring our Nation's resilience requires a commitment from all of us. Communities should come together now to take long-term actions to prepare for and reduce the economic, structural, social, and environmental effects of these storms. Preparedness is everyone's responsibility.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6 through May 12, 2018, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon everyone to take action this week by making use of the online resources provided by the National Weather Service and FEMA to safeguard your families, homes, and businesses from the dangers of hurricanes and severe storms. I also call upon Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial emergency management officials to help inform our communities about hurricane preparedness and response in order to help prevent storm damage and save lives. Further, I recognize the ongoing National Level Exercise 2018, in which more than 250 organizations are participating to examine the ability of all levels of government, private industry, and nongovernmental organizations to protect against, respond to, and recover from a major mid-Atlantic hurricane.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Public Service Recognition Week, we acknowledge our Nation's civil servants for their hard work and willingness to serve their fellow citizens. The contributions of these dedicated men and women strengthen our country and make a profound difference in the lives of all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>Members of our Federal, State, and local workforces bring incredible skills, tireless dedication, and selfless service to a broad range of career fields. Our Nation's civil servants include teachers, mail carriers, first responders, transit workers, and law enforcement officers. Our Federal employees underpin nearly all the operations of our Government.</FP>
  <FP>It is critical for Federal employees to provide excellent service and wise stewardship of taxpayer resources. In order to facilitate these goals, in March, I issued the President's Management Agenda, a long-term vision to modernize our Federal Government. Implementation of this comprehensive framework will enable employees to achieve the missions of their agencies in more efficient and secure manners. This Agenda leverages information technology, data, and our Federal workforce to accomplish transformational cross-agency goals. Through the Agenda, my Administration has established a transparent accountability structure, which includes quarterly reviews and public updates, to identify both successes and areas that need further attention.</FP>
  <FP>We are duty-bound to the American people to operate at the highest levels of capability and competency. I am confident that, in keeping with the Agenda, our devoted civil servants will execute their missions so that our Government becomes more efficient and more productive for the benefit of all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>Every day, our Nation's civil servants help make America better, safer, and stronger. This week, we honor their efforts and extend our gratitude for their exceptionalism and steadfast commitment to serving the American people.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Be Best Day, we encourage and promote the well-being of children everywhere. In an increasingly complex and inter-connected world, nothing is more important than raising the next generation of Americans to be healthy, happy, productive, and morally responsible adults. This begins with educating our children about the many critical issues they must confront in our modern world that affect their ability to lead balanced and fulfilled lives.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's children deserve certain knowledge that they are safe to grow, learn, and make mistakes. Adults must provide them with the tools they need to make positive contributions in their schools, with their friends, and in their communities.</FP>
  <FP>From every corner of our great country, we hear inspiring stories of Americans rising up to meet the challenges of our time, many of which have an especially pronounced effect on our children. On the inaugural Be Best Day, we highlight two of these challenges: negative social media behavior and the opioid crisis.</FP>
  <FP>Children who spend large amounts of time on social media are more likely to report mental health issues than those who spend time on non-screen activities. Technology, of course, plays a critical role in the economic and social development of our country. We must, however, recognize that it can also be used to harm. Be Best Day reminds us to emphasize the importance of using technology in positive ways.</FP>
  <FP>Additionally, opioid dependence, addiction, and abuse are at a point of crisis in America today. We all share a moral imperative to confront this crisis, and to help those families and children affected by it. Be Best Day affords an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of healthy children and pregnancies, including the risks neonatal abstinence syndrome poses to the long-term health of children.</FP>
  <FP>Today, on Be Best Day, let us commit ourselves to the critical task of building a better future for our children. We redouble our efforts to promote well-being and acts of encouragement, kindness, and respect. We highlight the importance of responsible use of social media; and we confront the crisis of opioid misuse that is robbing so many of our children of their potential.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7, 2018, as Be Best Day. I encourage Americans to take time to understand the many issues children face on a daily basis—both through personal interactions and through social media. I encourage parents to better understand the harmful effects of drug misuse on our youth, and also to find opportunities to support and celebrate our children. I encourage adults and parents to talk to children, and to get involved in programs that help educate our youth on the unique challenges related to growing up in today's world.<PRTPAGE P="133"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Military Spouse Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since the founding of our Republic, military spouses have served alongside their loved ones and played vital roles in the defense of our country. Their selfless support, volunteer spirit, and significant contributions have left indelible marks on our military and communities. On Military Spouse Day, we pay tribute to these remarkable patriots, past and present, including the incredible women and men who currently serve, in steadfast support of America's Armed Forces, as our Nation's military spouses.</FP>
  <FP>Military Spouse Day is an opportunity to thank the inspirational men and women who are the foundation of our Nation's military families. Their countless sacrifices and tireless devotion to this country, and to those who defend her, are invaluable and irreplaceable. Military spouses shoulder the burdens of a challenging and demanding lifestyle with pride, strength, and determination. They demonstrate uncommon grace and grit, and although most military spouses do not wear a uniform, they honorably serve our Nation—often times without their loved one standing beside them.</FP>
  <FP>We ask so much of our military spouses: frequent moves; heartbreaking separations; parenting alone; incomplete celebrations; and weeks, months, and sometimes years of waiting for a loved one's safe return from harm's way. Time and time again, however, military spouses respond with resilience that defies explanation. Our service members are often praised as national heroes, but their spouses are equally worthy of that distinction.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to taking care of our Armed Forces and ensuring that our military is equipped to defend our country and protect our way of life. This mission also includes caring for the unique needs of military spouses, whose service to our Nation cannot be overstated.</FP>
  <FP>Too often, military life can interfere with the aspirations and dreams of our military spouses. For example, frequent and often unexpected moves can impair career and academic goals. Even as our economy prospers, military spouses continue to face an unemployment rate far higher than the national average, up to 16 percent in 2017. Further, data from the 2016 American Community Survey indicates that military spouses suffer from underemployment at a greater rate than Americans more broadly, at an estimated 31.4 percent compared to 19.6 percent overall. All of these are added and unnecessary burdens on military families.</FP>

  <FP>We can and will do better, which is why my Administration will continue to focus on enhancing employment opportunities for military spouses. On May 9, I signed an Executive Order to enhance opportunities for military <PRTPAGE P="134"/>spouses looking for employment in the Federal Government. This action promotes the use of an existing hiring authority for military spouses and seeks to provide significantly greater opportunity for military spouses to be considered for Federal Government positions.</FP>
  <FP>Beyond the Federal Government, I encourage every American business, large and small, to find ways to employ military spouses, and keep them employed as they relocate—sometimes every 2 or 3 years—to new duty stations. More than 360 employers with regional and national footprints have made this commitment through the Department of Defense's Military Spouse Employment Partnership. In less than 7 years, these patriotic partners have hired more than 112,000 military spouses. We are grateful for these employment opportunities and hope to see many more businesses participate in this important initiative.</FP>
  <FP>In addition, many military spouses encounter unnecessary delays remaining in the workforce following a change in duty station. These spouses are more likely than other workers to face barriers to employment due to the impact of occupational licensing laws, since they frequently move across State lines and are disproportionately employed in occupations that require a license. Existing State laws regarding license portability are insufficient. States and occupational licensing boards can and must do more to improve the license portability to facilitate career continuity and ease financial burdens on our military families.</FP>
  <FP>As we observe Military Spouse Day, we salute generations of military spouses for their leadership, courage, love, patriotism, and unwavering support for the courageous men and women of our Armed Forces. On this day, Melania and I offer our deepest respect and gratitude to every person who has embraced this noble calling in proud service to our Nation as a military spouse.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>During National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, we celebrate the many forms of transportation and recognize the <PRTPAGE P="135"/>countless men and women who ensure that our transportation infrastructure systems operate effectively, efficiently, and, when needed, in support of our national defense. Since the early days of our Nation, the growth and expansion of the United States, as well as the strength of our country's national defense, have been inextricably linked to our investments into our transportation system.</FP>
  <FP>In 1919, a young lieutenant colonel named Dwight D. Eisenhower embarked on the United States Army's first transcontinental convoy from Washington, DC, to San Francisco, California. Over a trip that lasted 62 days, covered 3,251 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour, and overcame 230 accidents, Eisenhower witnessed firsthand the need for an efficient, reliable, and safe national transportation system. Nearly 40 years later, as President of the United States, he signed into law the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which created our Nation's landmark system of interstate highways.</FP>
  <FP>In recent years, our country's infrastructure has fallen behind due to political inaction, poor resource allocation, and a broken permitting process. We must take bold action and renew our commitment to our transportation system through reforms, effective investments, and transformative technologies. I have proposed an infrastructure plan that will generate a $1.5 trillion infusion into our country's once-great infrastructure and help to build a more prosperous future for all Americans. These funds will help rebuild our roads and bridges and create incentives for new State and local investments in infrastructure, raising wages and improving the quality of life for American families for years to come. Additionally, my Administration is focused on eliminating the unnecessary redundancies and inefficiencies in the regulatory and permitting procedures that hold back American infrastructure development. Finally, we must take particular care to focus resources on rural America, whose infrastructure must be supported and modernized to promote economic growth and well-being.</FP>
  <FP>Taken together, these policies will help ensure the efficient and free flow of commerce across our beautiful Nation and unleash a new era of prosperity. Every American depends on our roads, rails, airports, and waterways. But a highly functioning infrastructure network is especially critical to our men and women in uniform, who rely on it to facilitate the flow of the equipment and supplies they need to stay safe and protect America. By taking the appropriate and necessary actions, we will restore our infrastructure to greatness so that it serves all Americans, including those in our Nation's military.</FP>
  <FP>To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), has designated the third Friday in May of each year as “National Defense Transportation Day,” and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), has declared that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as “National Transportation Week.”</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 18, 2018, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 13 through May 19, 2018, as National Transportation Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities to learn more about how our <PRTPAGE P="136"/>transportation system contributes to the security of our citizens and the prosperity of our Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we acknowledge the incredible service and sacrifices law enforcement personnel make each day for their fellow Americans. The brave men and women of our Nation's law enforcement work long hours, often in dangerous situations, to protect our lives, liberty, and property. We also take this opportunity to pay tribute to law enforcement personnel who have been killed or disabled in the line of duty. We will never forget their courage.</FP>
  <FP>In addition to expressing our appreciation for our dedicated law enforcement professionals, we must equip them to carry out the tremendous responsibility of keeping our communities safe. Through the Department of Justice, my Administration will continue to provide our Nation's law enforcement agencies with the resources they need and deserve to keep our citizens safe and our communities secure. This includes providing substantial funding for hiring additional police officers, training for active shooter situations, and improving the safety of our Nation's schools.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration will also continue to advance the National Blue Alert Network, an emergency alert and early warning system that protects America's law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. The Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission worked together to establish a dedicated Emergency Alert System event code. This code facilitates rapid dissemination of critical information to law enforcement agencies and the public about violent offenders who have killed, seriously injured, or who pose an imminent and credible threat to law enforcement officers. The exceptional men and women of law enforcement work every day to protect our lives, and this code helps us protect theirs.</FP>

  <FP>The safety and health of our officers must be a priority for all Americans. Every day, members of law enforcement risk their lives in service to those they have pledged to protect and defend. We must not take their devotion to duty for granted, and we must do everything in our power to ensure their physical and mental well-being. Earlier this year, I was pleased to sign into law the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017, which helps provide police officers the resources they need to deal with job stress and trauma associated with their demanding career field.<PRTPAGE P="137"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The work of law enforcement officers is essential to preserving peace in our communities and to ensuring the safety of precious lives and personal property. My Administration proudly salutes the patriots in law enforcement who selflessly serve our Nation. We also solemnly acknowledge our debt to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. These officers and their families have our prayers and unwavering gratitude.</FP>
  <FP>By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as “Peace Officers Memorial Day” and the week in which it falls as “Police Week.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2018, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 13 through May 19, 2018, as Police Week. In humble appreciation of our hardworking law enforcement officers, Melania and I will light the White House in blue on May 15. I call upon all Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Mother's Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Mother's Day is a very special occasion and opportunity to express our endless gratitude to the women who give their unyielding love and devotion to their families, and their unending sacrifices to guide, protect, and nurture the success of their children. Our country has long appreciated and benefited from the contributions women have made to empowering and inspiring not only those under their roofs, but those in our schools, communities, governments, and businesses.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation's mothers are steadfast during times of heartbreak and hardship, triumph and accomplishment. They are unwavering examples of strength and resilience. In times of uncertainty and despair, they are our steady compasses, providing wisdom and guidance along the way. In times of success and joy, they are our most ardent supporters, cheering us to ever-greater heights. Mothers are our tireless advocates, always recognizing our gifts and talents, and helping us achieve our full potential.<PRTPAGE P="138"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>On Mother's Day, we also pause to remember the women who are no longer with us. Their indelible spirits live on in the character of the generations they helped shape. We can see this in the inspiring legacy of First Lady Barbara Pierce Bush. As a selfless wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, military spouse, and First Lady, Mrs. Bush was a fierce advocate for the American family. Her resolute faith, love, and loyalty is forever etched into the heart of our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>Today, and every day, let us express our utmost respect, admiration, and appreciation for our mothers who have given us the sacred gifts of life and unconditional love. In all that they do, mothers influence their families, their communities, our Nation, and our world. Whether we became their children through birth, adoption, or foster care, we know the unmatched power of the love, dedication, devotion, and wisdom of our mothers.</FP>
  <FP>In recognition of the contributions of mothers to American families and to our Nation, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as Mother's Day, and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 13, 2018, as Mother's Day. I encourage all Americans to express their love and respect for their mothers or beloved mother figures, whether with us in person or in spirit, and to reflect on the importance of motherhood to the prosperity of our families, communities, and Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Safe Boating Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>As summer approaches, Americans across the country will begin to enjoy time out on the water with their families and friends. Whether fishing, watching beautiful sunsets, learning how to navigate, or continuing family traditions, boating promises fun and lasting memories. Realizing the joy of boating, however, requires that we follow safe boating practices. During National Safe Boating Week, I urge all Americans to prepare for boating activities by becoming familiar with proper safety procedures.</FP>

  <FP>Americans should take precautionary actions to ensure that everyone makes it home unharmed after fun on the water. Inspecting your boat thoroughly and participating in a free vessel safety check offered through the Coast Guard can help ensure both you and your boat are ready for the water. A pre-departure checklist can help remind you to monitor the <PRTPAGE P="139"/>weather and bring required equipment, and filing a float plan with a reliable person helps ensure that the Coast Guard is notified if you do not return as planned. Boaters should also wear life jackets and make sure there is always someone onboard who is unimpaired and capable of operating the boat. The Coast Guard and its Federal, State, and local partners estimate that avoiding alcohol and wearing a life jacket can prevent more than 80 percent of boating fatalities.</FP>
  <FP>In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as “National Safe Boating Week.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 19 through May 25, 2018, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices and taking advantage of boating safety education opportunities. I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety through events and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Emergency Medical Services Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Emergency Medical Services Week, we recognize the outstanding contributions and lifesaving actions of our Nation's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers. With their unwavering courage, acute skill, and tireless efforts, career and volunteer first responders serve our communities throughout all hours of the day and night, providing emergency medical treatment in times of dire need. We also honor the memory and inspiring legacy of the EMS providers who have lost their lives as they helped save others.</FP>
  <FP>Last year, as historic wildfires and devastating hurricanes swept through the country, EMS providers repeatedly came to the aid of their fellow Americans. They spent days on duty without pause, moving thousands of homebound residents out of harm's way, rescuing people from fires and floods, and providing medical care to individuals in shelters. Citizens from all backgrounds bravely volunteered to assist these first responders, reminding us that no challenge is too great for the American people.</FP>

  <FP>On the front lines of the opioid crisis, EMS providers routinely face situations of tremendous danger. Recently, the Office of National Drug Control <PRTPAGE P="140"/>Policy issued guidance on how EMS personnel and other first responders can balance safety with mobility and efficiency when responding to scenes where the presence of heroin, fentanyl, or other highly toxic drugs is suspected. My Administration is committed to working with State and local partners to ensure first responders are adequately trained and equipped to respond to every crisis, safely and effectively.</FP>
  <FP>This year marks the conclusion of <E T="03">EMS Agenda 2050</E>—a collaborative effort led by the EMS community with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security. <E T="03">EMS Agenda 2050</E> will set forth a strategic vision for the future of EMS in America. We welcome this effort to empower EMS professionals to play a central role in the well-being of our communities through data-driven, evidence-based, innovative, and safe approaches to prevention, response, and clinical care.</FP>
  <FP>This week, and throughout the year, we extend our sincere respect and gratitude to all EMS providers throughout our Nation. Despite danger, chaos, and daunting obstacles, they consistently protect the safety and health of others. For this, our country is deeply grateful.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 2018, as Emergency Medical Services Week.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">World Trade Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>America's trade relationships are critical to our economic vitality and world leadership. During World Trade Week, we reaffirm our Nation's unwavering commitment to trading regimes that are free, fair, and reciprocal.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation has entered a new era in trade policy that is based on the recognition that our economic security is critical to our national security. My trade agenda aims to accelerate American exports through policies that are focused on rebuilding our industries, strengthening the defense industrial base in the United States, and equipping our workforce with state-of-the-art skills. As part of this strategy, I will continue to renegotiate and modernize our trade agreements to meet the challenges of the 21st century. My Administration is also enforcing our well-established trade laws once again, as well as eliminating burdensome and unnecessary regulations and foreign <PRTPAGE P="141"/>barriers to our products and services. We are focused on promoting American industries and goods; as a result of vigorous tax, trade, and regulatory policies, we are attracting a new wave of investment into our Nation's commercial enterprises.</FP>
  <FP>Over the past year, the United States has made tremendous strides in restoring our Nation's economy. American firms, however, are still vastly underrepresented in international markets. My Administration is taking concrete actions to restore America's capacity to compete in an increasingly international market. We are dedicated to a renewed and equitable North American Free Trade Agreement that promotes the export of American products rather than American jobs. The recent agreement in principle on the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement offers an opportunity to rebalance an unfair trade relationship. By strongly enforcing trading rules, our Nation's businesses and manufacturers will be better positioned to gain strength domestically and in export markets throughout the world.</FP>
  <FP>The United States will no longer tolerate any foreign nations gaining unfair advantages on American industries by stealing or forcing the transfer of our companies' technology or intellectual property, subsidizing their exporters, illegally dumping products into our markets, and building excessive and unnecessary capacity. These unfair and distortionary trade practices flood global markets, depress prices, and harm our companies and workers. We will not allow these practices to compromise our leadership in intellectual property, digital products, innovative technology, manufacturing, agriculture, and numerous industrial sectors.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration recognizes the importance of prioritizing the interests of American workers and businesses by promoting reciprocal trade based on open, fair, and competitive markets. By adhering to these fundamental principles of international trade, we will expand trade in a way that is fair for the United States and leads to a more effective and balanced world trading system.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 2018, as World Trade Week. I encourage Americans to observe this week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate the benefits of trade to our country.</FP>

  <FP>On Armed Forces Day, we pay tribute to the extraordinary men and women who serve our Nation with valor and distinction in all branches of the military. This annual observance honors their steadfast service in preserving our Nation's peace, preserving our freedom, and defending our founding principles.</FP>
  <FP>Throughout our history, in times of war and peace, our service members have served with bravery, skill, and unwavering devotion to duty. There is no fighting force that rivals that of the United States military. The precious liberties all Americans enjoy are possible because, every day and without exception, our Armed Forces relentlessly and tirelessly carry out the critical mission of protecting our country, our freedoms, and our way of life.</FP>
  <FP>Taking care of our Armed Forces is one of the highest priorities of my Administration. Our military has made tremendous gains against ISIS and al-Qa'ida in Syria and Iraq, with ISIS having lost nearly 100 percent of the territory it formerly occupied. These successes underscore the importance of continuing to support, grow, and modernize our military forces—we must ensure that our Armed Forces remain second to none. Earlier this year, I signed into law legislation that does just that, providing nearly $700 billion in funding for national defense. These funds will increase our military's capacity—investing billions in new equipment, maintenance, and troop readiness.</FP>
  <FP>We will never be able to repay fully our heroes for their selfless service. We must, therefore, guarantee that we support them and their families here at home so that they can effectively execute their missions abroad. I was very pleased to sign into law legislation that gave our troops a 2.4 percent pay raise—their largest pay raise in 8 years. I was also proud to sign an Executive Order this month to enhance employment opportunities for the spouses of our service members. My Administration will not stop in our efforts to encourage all sectors of our country—private and public—to find ways to support our troops and their loved ones.</FP>
  <FP>On this day, and every day, we owe a debt of gratitude to our service members stationed at home and those deployed around the world. All across America, we enjoy the blessings of liberty because our Nation's finest men and women willingly accept the call to service. We proudly salute our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen, and recognize the families who serve alongside them for their courage and commitment.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the tradition of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.</FP>

  <FP>I invite the Governors of the States and Territories and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate <PRTPAGE P="143"/>manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.</FP>

  <FP>On National Maritime Day, we recognize the critical role the United States Merchant Marine plays in bolstering national security and facilitating economic growth. We honor our merchant mariners for their contributions to connecting the States, supporting our military, and cementing ties among our allies.</FP>
  <FP>Long known as the “Fourth Arm of Defense,” the United States Merchant Marine has served with valor and distinction in every American conflict. The important work of the Merchant Marine was never more evident than during World War II, when merchant mariners sailed dangerous seas and fought enemies as they connected our Armed Forces fighting abroad to vital supplies produced by hardworking Americans at home. In the course of their valiant efforts, they endured the loss of more than 730 large vessels, and more than 6,000 merchant mariners died at sea or as prisoners of war.</FP>
  <FP>Today, American mariners facilitate the shipment of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods along maritime trade routes for American businesses and consumers. Merchant mariners are ambassadors of good will, projecting a peaceful United States presence along the sea lanes of the world and into regions of core strategic importance to our Nation. Often risking their lives by sailing into war zones, our merchant mariners continue to support our troops overseas by providing them with needed cargo and logistical support. They also advance humanitarian missions worldwide, including last year's effort to ship tens of thousands of containers of lifesaving supplies to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after they had been devastated by hurricanes.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as “National Maritime Day” to commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819 by the S.S.

  <FP>On Memorial Day, we pause in solemn gratitude to pay tribute to the brave patriots who laid down their lives defending peace and freedom while in military service to our great Nation. We set aside this day to honor their sacrifice and to remind all Americans of the tremendous price of our precious liberty.</FP>
  <FP>Throughout the history of our Republic, courageous Americans have purchased our cherished freedom with their lives. Our 151 national cemeteries serve as the final resting place for millions of people, including veterans from every war and conflict, many of whom died while serving our country. We remain duty bound to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf and to remember them with thankfulness and unwavering pride. The fallen—our treasured loved ones, friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens—deserve nothing less from a grateful Nation.</FP>
  <FP>We must safeguard the legacies of our service members so that our children and our grandchildren will understand the sacrifices of our Armed Forces. As a part of this effort, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is working to keep the memories of our fallen heroes from ever fading away. The National Cemetery Administration's Veterans Legacy Program challenges our youth, from elementary school through college, to research and share the stories and sacrifice of their hometown veterans, who are forever honored at VA National, State, and tribal veterans cemeteries. To further ensure that our veterans' legacies are remembered and celebrated, this program is developing an online memorialization platform that will amplify the voices of families, survivors, and Gold Star parents and spouses as they honor our beloved veterans and fallen service members.</FP>
  <FP>Today, and every day, we revere those who have died in noble service to our country. I call upon all Americans to remember the selfless service members who have been laid to rest in flag-draped coffins and their families who have suffered the greatest loss. The sacrifices of our hallowed dead demand our Nation's highest honor and deepest gratitude.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Great Outdoors Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Great Outdoors Month, we celebrate the unmatched magnificence of our Nation's mountains, waters, canyons, and coastlines. Spending time in the great outdoors, especially during summer, is an American tradition. Every American should take the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of our natural wonders, which stretch from coast to coast and beyond.</FP>
  <FP>As Americans, we are blessed with many stunning lands and waters that surround each of our communities. Our numerous forests, wildlife refuges, and local parks offer endless opportunities for recreation, adventure, and renewal. Early morning fishing trips and the thrill of summiting mountain peaks with friends create lasting memories. The splendid beauty of a sunset can inspire, while the solitude of a weekend camping trip often brings long-sought tranquility.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has made access to public land a top priority. We have modified national monuments to enhance public use and enjoyment of nearly two million acres of public land in Utah, and opened or expanded hunting and fishing access at 10 national wildlife refuges across the country. The splendor of our country's treasured lands is a source of national pride, and Americans should be able to enjoy as many of our treasured outdoor spaces as possible, in as many ways as possible.</FP>

  <FP>As summer approaches, I encourage all Americans to step outside and appreciate America's natural beauty and to practice good stewardship of our environment. By enjoying our great outdoors, we enhance our collective efforts to preserve our natural lands and waters, protecting them for future generations.<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2018 as Great Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors while acting as stewards of our lands and waters.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.DONALD J. TRUMP</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, as amended (aluminum articles), by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning March 23, 2018. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>

  <FP>3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted the continuing discussions with the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from those countries. Recognizing that each of these countries and the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, I determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from <PRTPAGE P="148"/>these countries was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, until May 1, 2018.</FP>
  <FP>4. In Proclamation 9739 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that the United States had agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imports from these countries and extended the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, in order to finalize the details.</FP>
  <FP>5. The United States has agreed on a range of measures with Argentina and Australia, including measures to reduce excess aluminum production and excess aluminum capacity, measures that will contribute to increased capacity utilization in the United States, and measures to prevent the transshipment of aluminum articles and avoid import surges. In my judgment, these measures will provide effective, long-term alternative means to address these countries' contribution to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining aluminum articles exports to the United States from each of them, limiting transshipment and surges, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and excess aluminum production. In light of these agreements, I have determined that aluminum articles imports from these countries will no longer threaten to impair the national security and thus have decided to exclude these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with these countries to address our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.</FP>
  <FP>6. In light of my determination to exclude, on a long-term basis, these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of the agreed-upon measures with these countries, and the fact that the tariff will now apply to imports of aluminum articles from additional countries, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.</FP>
  <FP>7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:<PRTPAGE P="149"/>
  </FP>
  <P>(1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following two sentences: “Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all aluminum articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union, (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the European Union, and (c) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina and Australia.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security shall implement this quota as soon as practicable, taking into account all aluminum articles imports from this country since January 1, 2018.</P>
  <P>(3) The “Article description” for heading 9903.85.01 of the HTSUS is amended by deleting “of Brazil, of Canada, of Mexico, or of the member countries of the European Union”.</P>
  <P>(4) For the purposes of administering the quantitative limitations applicable to subheadings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.06 for Argentina, the annual aggregate limits set out in Part B of the Annex to this proclamation shall apply for the period starting with calendar year 2018 and for subsequent years, unless modified or terminated. The quantitative limitations applicable to subheadings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.06 for Argentina, which for calendar year 2018 shall take into account all aluminum articles imports from Argentina since January 1, 2018, shall be effective for aluminum articles entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after June 1, 2018, and shall be implemented by CBP as soon as practicable, consistent with the superior text to subheadings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.06. The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor the implementation of the quantitative limitations applicable to subheadings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.06 and shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representative, and such other senior Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, inform the President of any circumstance that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate that an adjustment of the quantitative limitations is necessary.</P>

  <P>(5) The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with CBP and with other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>.<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
  </P>
  <P>(6) Clause 5 of Proclamation 9710, as amended, is amended by striking the phrase “as amended by Proclamation 9710,” in the first and second sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following phrase: “as amended, or to the quantitative limitations established by proclamation,”.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel mill articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of steel mill articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended (steel articles), by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning March 23, 2018. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>

  <FP>4. In Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I noted that the United States had agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by steel articles imports from these countries and extended the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, as amended, in order to finalize the details.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we honor America's long-shared history with our neighbors in the Caribbean and celebrate the Caribbean Americans who have enriched our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>Caribbean Americans embody the American spirit, with their talents and hard work contributing greatly to America's economy. They protect our citizens as law enforcement officers, serve our communities as public officials, and mentor our country's young people as educators. Through their tremendous athleticism and determination, they have brought pride to the hearts of the American people as members of numerous U.S. Olympic teams. Their leadership and resolve have made incredible contributions to our society.</FP>
  <FP>As trailblazers, Americans with Caribbean roots have sewn their own unique thread into the fabric of our Nation. Dr. William Thornton, a native of the British Virgin Islands, designed the United States Capitol and is generally considered the first “Architect of the Capitol”. Jean Baptiste du Sable, the first permanent resident of Chicago, was born in Haiti. Widely recognized as the “Founder of Chicago,” his prosperous trade settlement has become one of the most iconic cities in the world.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we acknowledge the numerous contributions of Caribbean Americans to our Nation, including those of the more than 4 million Caribbean Americans who live in the United States today. We are also deeply grateful to the many Caribbean Americans who have served or are currently serving our country as members of our Armed Forces.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2018 as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to join in celebrating the history, culture, and achievements of Caribbean Americans with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.DONALD J. TRUMP<PRTPAGE P="175"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Homeownership Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Homeownership Month, we affirm the joy and benefits of homeownership. For millions of Americans, owning a home is an important step toward financial security and achieving the American Dream. My Administration is committed to fostering an economic environment in which every family has the opportunity to enjoy the sense of pride and stability that can come with owning a home.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's economy is experiencing tremendous growth. I signed into law historic tax reform that cut taxes for middle class Americans and small businesses. My Administration has also slashed unnecessary and burdensome regulations that stunted economic growth. As a result of these actions, Americans are keeping more of their hard-earned paychecks, unemployment rates are at historic lows, and more Americans are entering the workforce. Consequently, owning a home is becoming more attainable for many Americans.</FP>
  <FP>Numerous benefits are associated with homeownership. Owning a home gives Americans a place to call their own, and a place of comfort and safety where they can raise their families. Homeowners also support local businesses, have a strong vested interest in their communities, and foster bonds of friendship with others who live and work in their neighborhoods. A home is more than a place to live—it is also an investment in family, in community, and in the long-term prosperity of our great country.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we celebrate those Americans whose success and determination have helped make them homeowners. Their dedication to their families and communities, and to achieving a brighter and more secure future, is an inspiration to each person who is pursuing their own American Dream.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2018 as National Homeownership Month.</FP>

  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.DONALD J. TRUMP<PRTPAGE P="176"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Ocean Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The United States is a nation whose identity, wealth, and security are inextricably linked with the ocean and coastal waters. From sea to shining sea, Americans benefit from the ocean's bounty—from the industries it supports and the jobs it creates. During National Ocean Month, we celebrate this immense natural resource, and the millions of hardworking Americans employed by our ocean industries. We recognize the many ways our oceans and coasts enhance our lives. We acknowledge that our Nation can more effectively and responsibly harness its waters to the great benefit of its citizens.</FP>
  <FP>Through the unique geography of its mainland and the strategic locations of Alaska, Hawaii, and its territories, the United States has the exclusive commercial rights to an oceanic area larger than the combined landmass of the 50 States. This invaluable national asset, called the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), is currently underutilized. To harness the vast resources of the EEZ, we will develop and deploy new technologies in partnership with American academic institutions and innovators. We will streamline regulations and administrative practices to promote economic growth, while protecting our marine environment for current and future generations. We will also create new opportunities for American products in the global marketplace, including through continued support of our commercial fisheries and promotion of domestic aquaculture.</FP>
  <FP>To advance America's economic, security, and environmental interests, it is also critical that we explore, map, and inventory our Nation's waters and pursue advanced observational technologies and forecasting capabilities. By exploring, developing, and conserving the ocean resources of our great Nation, we will augment our economic competitiveness, enhance our national security, and ensure American prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2018 as National Ocean Month. This month, I call upon Americans to reflect on the value and importance of oceans not only to our security and economy, but also as a source of recreation, enjoyment, and relaxation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">African-American Music Appreciation Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During African-American Music Appreciation Month, we celebrate the tremendous achievements and contributions of African-American musicians. The musical ingenuity of talented African American artists laid the foundation for so many recognizable and cherished genres of music, including rock and roll, rhythm and blues, jazz, gospel, hip hop, and rap.</FP>
  <FP>Throughout our history, African-American music has demonstrated its power to elicit comfort, healing, happiness, conviction, and inspiration—as well as its ability to unite people of all backgrounds. Today, it resonates in jazz quartets, rock and roll guitar solos, gospel choirs, and hip hop beats. The expression of these artistic and diverse styles of music acts as a voice for freedom, justice, love, and the pursuit of happiness.</FP>
  <FP>African-American music has played a significant role in shaping the American dream and instilling a sense of pride in being an “American.” The talent and creativity of pioneers like Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Etta James, Whitney Houston, and many others have indelibly enriched our culture and our lives. As Etta James noted, “I wanna show that gospel, country, blues, rhythm and blues, jazz, rock ‘n’  roll are all just really one thing. Those are the American music and that is the American culture.” Etta James recognized that the history and evolution of music in America reflects our country's cultural uniqueness and our country's commitment to protect and love every voice.</FP>
  <FP>African-American music brings together people of all backgrounds—people who hum it, whistle it, and sing it—to enjoy blended tunes and hard-to-hit notes. Its contagious rhythm empowers its listeners to recall memories of the past and grow excited for the future. Our Nation is indebted to all the African-American artists whose music fills our airways and our homes, lifts our spirits, and compels us to think, dance, and sing. These musicians and their legacies ignite our imaginations and prove to us that the sky is the limit.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2018 as African-American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and appreciation of African-American music.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>More than two centuries ago, on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress formally adopted the Stars and Stripes as the official flag of our new Republic. Through the many triumphs and trials of our Nation, our flag has reflected our heritage of liberty and embodied the American virtues of bravery, justice, and loyalty. Each year, we celebrate Flag Day and National Flag Week to honor our timeless national emblem.</FP>
  <FP>Our flag symbolizes our solemn pride and eternal gratitude to our service members, who willingly raise their hand in front of our Nation's colors and take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Our flag also serves as a final acknowledgement of our country's gratitude to the families of those soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen who have given their last full measure of devotion to our country. After the echo of the last rifle volley and the final notes of “Taps” fade away, the flag is carefully folded and presented to the grieving families of our fallen heroes to serve as a source of comfort and strength in times of immense sorrow.</FP>
  <FP>Our majestic flag flies during our country's most memorable occasions. In the early morning of May 10 of this year, a large American flag undulated in the breeze over the homecoming of three Americans released from captivity in North Korea. It also presided during our astronauts' many missions exploring the moon's surface, the heroic triumph of the Marines at the battle of Iwo Jima, and the recovery operations at New York City's ground zero and the Pentagon immediately following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Our country's colors—bold and brilliant—symbolize to the world those values we hold sacred, freedom and liberty, and our hope for a better world.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we celebrate the ideals of our country's founding, which are represented so proudly by the broad stripes and bright stars—that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. May we never forget the tremendous sacrifices required to secure and maintain our freedom. Let us proudly stand and remember our founding principles and our country's ever continuing march to achieve a more perfect Union. As we raise our flag, let us resolve always to cherish it with reverence and eternal gratitude so that the red, white, and blue may forever wave from sea to shining sea.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2018, as Flag Day, and the week starting June 10, 2018, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.<PRTPAGE P="179"/>

  <FP>On Father's Day, we pay special tribute to the men who devote themselves to supporting and caring for their loved ones. We take this occasion to show our gratitude to our fathers, to thank them for inspiring us to be our best, and to appreciate the influence they have in shaping our character and guiding our futures.</FP>
  <FP>Fathers across our country serve as role models for their children and families. Through their examples, they display the fundamental American values of hard work and dedication, which are so important to fulfilling our potential and achieving the American Dream. In each stage of our development, their unwavering support inspires us to take on the next big challenge and to pursue ambitious goals we might otherwise have thought beyond our reach. Their engagement in our communities, from the soccer field to Main Street to the town hall, enriches American life and encourages others to get involved.</FP>
  <FP>As a Nation, we reaffirm our commitment to promoting fatherhood in our neighborhoods and communities. All fathers must know and harness their power to shape the future of their children. More and more, scientific studies show that fathers who actively invest in their children improve their lives emotionally, physically, academically, and economically. My Administration supports the continuation of grant funding to States and community organizations that educate men on the significance of active fatherhood and assist them with entering or staying in the workforce so they can contribute to the emotional and financial well-being of their children and families.</FP>
  <FP>Today, and every day, we honor our fathers who serve their families with humble and giving hearts. Whether we became their children through birth, adoption, or foster care, the incredible fathers in our lives generously share with us the powerful gifts of love and care through their presence and dedication. We express our love and gratitude to our fathers for the countless ways they have improved our lives and acknowledge the tremendous importance of active fatherhood to our families, communities, and country.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THERFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 17, 2018, as Father's Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Captive Nations Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Two hundred and forty-two years ago, America was founded on the fundamental principle that all men and women are created equal and share an inherent dignity that government must value, respect, and protect. The founding of our great country lit a spark of freedom that spread around the world, unleashing human potential and lifting billions out of poverty. Today, we continue this sacred legacy. We hold in common the responsibility to strengthen the bonds of liberty for future generations to inherit and carry forward.<PRTPAGE P="181"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>At the same time, we recognize that many around the world continue to live under the dark shadow of oppression and despotism. During Captive Nations Week, we remember that the rights and privileges we enjoy in the United States are not held by all. We stand in solidarity with those who continue to suffer under governments that stifle basic freedoms and deny the opportunity to build a better life.</FP>
  <FP>President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed the first Captive Nations Week in 1959 during the height of the Cold War. At that time, the United States was locked in an enduring struggle to preserve and advance freedom for nations held captive by totalitarian communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. These regimes dismissed the very idea of individual rights. Then, as it does today, the United States blazed as a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for lovers of freedom and justice, and for those who strive for the rule of law.</FP>
  <FP>When the citizens of East Germany tore down the Berlin Wall in 1989, it was a defining moment for freedom. But much work remains unfinished. In many countries today, people remain subject to unjust arrest, detention, and execution. Individual rights, such as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom to assemble, which are necessary to hold governments accountable, are significantly circumvented or denied entirely. The United States stands with the repressed and continues to encourage despotic regimes to turn away from authoritarianism and respect the God-given rights of life and liberty.</FP>
  <FP>As we observe Captive Nations Week, let us recall the words of President Ronald Reagan, declared on this occasion in 1983: “Free people, if they are to remain free, must defend the liberty of others.” Let us today resolve to continue the work of those who came before: to ensure that America remains the world's brightest example of liberty; to do justice; to respect the rule of law; and to never, ever give up on liberty.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as “Captive Nations Week.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THERFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 15 through July 21, 2018, as Captive Nations Week.

  <FP>On Made in America Day and during Made in America Week, we celebrate the importance of American manufacturing, construction, agriculture, mining, and entrepreneurship to our Nation's prosperity and economic vitality. Made in America products represent the global gold standard for quality, innovation, and craftsmanship and the output of a highly skilled workforce that is second to none.</FP>
  <FP>American workers and job creators sustain and inspire the American Dream, while enhancing both our economic and national security, which are inextricably linked.</FP>
  <FP>For far too long, the working men and women of our country have been ignored. That era is over.</FP>
  <FP>Last year, I signed into law historic tax cuts and reform, which have unleashed a flow of investment and jobs back into America from overseas. Optimism among American manufacturers has hit all-time highs as American businesses across the country have paid bonuses, increased wages, and boosted contributions to employee retirement plans.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is also delivering on its promise to cut unnecessary and burdensome regulations that hamper economic growth.</FP>
  <FP>I have consistently pledged to the American people that I will reinvigorate our workforce by instituting fair and reciprocal trade practices so that companies can compete, thrive, and grow. My trade agenda is focused on defending our workers and businesses from unfair trade practices and on removing barriers to our products and services, so that our Nation can compete and so that “buy American and hire American” once again becomes the best option in an increasingly international and competitive market. Accordingly, I will continue to negotiate and modernize our trade agreements to bring about free, fair, and reciprocal trade and thereby ensure open, fair, and competitive markets for America's products and services.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation continues to thrive due to the determination, imagination, skill, creativity, and excellence of our people. American industry reflects these qualities and evokes patriotism, pride, and the hope of a bright and prosperous future. We salute our Nation's workers, job creators, and inventors, and we pledge to continue creating an environment that makes the United States the most attractive place in the world to do business.</FP>

  <FP>On the 28th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we celebrate this historic legislation, which echoed our Nation's founding promise to recognize and secure the equal rights of all men and women. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to cultivate further opportunities for all Americans to live full and independent lives, and recognize the many contributions enabled by expanded participation of Americans with disabilities in our society.</FP>
  <FP>President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law on July 26, 1990. It has transformed the lives of millions of Americans living with disabilities by promoting their equal access to employment, government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and public transportation. Today, people of all ages with disabilities are better able to thrive in the community, pursue careers, contribute to our economy, and fully participate in American society.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation must continue to build upon this foundation and continue to further the participation of the more than 56 million Americans living with disabilities. My Administration continues to encourage research that will lead to advancements in technology, medicine, and other fields and better enable independent living. We are also expanding and promoting equal education and employment opportunities for Americans with disabilities to live and work. In this regard, in June of last year, I signed an Executive Order to develop more apprenticeship programs for all people, including those with disabilities. Additional training will encourage better involvement from businesses and allow people with disabilities to contribute meaningfully to a wide variety of industries.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>This year marks the 65th anniversary of the signing of the armistice that ended the fighting of the Korean War. For 3 brutal years, our Armed Forces and allies fought valiantly to stop the spread of communism and defend freedom on the Korean Peninsula. On National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, we remember the bravery and sacrifices of those who fought and died for this noble cause.</FP>
  <FP>On the Korean Peninsula, our brave Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, and Coast Guardsmen fought with skill and resolve against tyranny and oppression. Justice, liberty, and democracy prevailed, but victory came at a tremendous cost. More than 33,000 Americans were killed in action during the Korean War, and more than 103,000 were wounded. Thousands more were captured and held as prisoners of war. Many are still missing in action. We will never forget these valiant patriots or their families, who have endured unimaginable loss.</FP>
  <FP>More than six decades after the cease-fire on the Korean Peninsula, our relationship with South Korea continues to flourish. We have forged a powerful friendship built on respect, a mutual desire for economic prosperity, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values and peace through strength.</FP>
  <FP>In contrast, our relationship with North Korea has been hostile, due to continued threats to our allies, their development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, and ongoing human rights violations. Last month's historic summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un in Singapore, however, has offered a renewed sense of hope for the future—including the promise of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. During this summit, I raised my concern for the many American families who have been unable to properly bury the loved ones they lost during the Korean War and bring closure to this chapter in their lives. As a result, Chairman Kim and I announced our commitment to the recovery and repatriation of the remains of Americans missing in action. My Administration will fulfill our Nation's solemn duty to bring our patriots home with dignity and honor.</FP>

  <FP>Today, we honor our Korean War Veterans for their immeasurable contributions to the cause of liberty. We also salute members of the armed forces, past and present, who have maintained an allied presence on the Korean Peninsula since the 1953 armistice. Their efforts to stave off aggression are worthy of our highest respect and gratitude.<PRTPAGE P="185"/>

In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, the President designated the Republic of Rwanda (“Rwanda”) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the “1974 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (the “AGOA”).</FP>
  <FP>2. Sections 506A(d)(4)(C) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(d)(4)(C)) and 506A(c)(1) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(c)(1)) of the 1974 Act authorize the President to suspend the application of duty-free treatment provided for any article described in section 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(b)(1)) or section 112 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721) with respect to a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if the President determines that the beneficiary country is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, and that suspending such duty-free treatment would be more effective in promoting compliance by the country with those requirements than terminating the designation of the country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act.</FP>
  <FP>3. Pursuant to section 506A(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Rwanda is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and that suspending the application of duty-free treatment to certain goods would be more effective in promoting compliance by Rwanda with such requirements than terminating the designation of Rwanda as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. Accordingly, I have decided to suspend the application of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the apparel sector from Rwanda for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act.</FP>

  <FP>4. Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006, implemented the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (“USBFTA”) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 101(a) of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “USBFTA Implementation Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), incorporated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the <PRTPAGE P="186"/>United States (HTS) the rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USBFTA.</FP>
  <FP>5. Section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the “1988 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the United States International Trade Commission (the “Commission”) under section 1205 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005) if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the “Convention”) and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>6. In Proclamation 9549 of December 1, 2016, pursuant to the authority provided in section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, the President modified the HTS to reflect amendments to the Convention. Bahrain is a party to the Convention and likewise implemented the amendments to the Convention in its tariff schedule.</FP>
  <FP>7. Because of these changes in the national tariff schedules of the parties to the USBFTA, the rules of origin set out in Annexes 3-A and 4-A of the USBFTA must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USBFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were modified in Proclamation 9549. The USBFTA parties have agreed to make these changes in a protocol to the USBFTA that went into effect on November 30, 2017.</FP>
  <FP>8. Section 202 of the USBFTA Implementation Act provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USBFTA. Section 202(j)(1) of the USBFTA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the USBFTA and any subordinate categories necessary to carry out the USBFTA, subject to certain exceptions set out in section 202(j)(2)(A).</FP>
  <FP>9. I have determined that modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 9549.</FP>
  <FP>10. Following the amendments to the Convention reflected by the modifications to the HTS made in Proclamation 9549, the World Customs Organization issued a small number of conforming amendments to the Convention that should have been included in the amendments that were implemented on January 1, 2017, pursuant to Proclamation 9549. The Commission then recommended additional modifications to the HTS pursuant to section 1205 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to these most recent amendments to the Convention. I have determined that these recommended modifications to the HTS proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.</FP>

  <FP>11. Proclamation 9693 of January 23, 2018, implemented action in the form of a safeguard measure under section 203 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2253) with respect to certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products (such as modules).<PRTPAGE P="187"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>12. The safeguard measure imposed a tariff-rate quota, for a period of 4 years, on imports of solar cells that are not partially or fully assembled into other products, and an increase in duties on imports of modules, as defined by Note 18(g) in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS, also for a period of 4 years.</FP>
  <FP>13. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>14. Proclamation 9693 modified chapter 99 of the HTS to implement the safeguard measure described in paragraphs 11 and 12 of this proclamation.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of these steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries.</FP>
  <FP>3. In Proclamation 9705, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of steel articles and inform me of any circumstances that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 with respect to such imports.</FP>
  <FP>4. The Secretary has informed me that while capacity utilization in the domestic steel industry has improved, it is still below the target capacity utilization level the Secretary recommended in his report. Although imports of steel articles have declined since the imposition of the tariff, I am advised that they are still several percentage points greater than the level of imports that would allow domestic capacity utilization to reach the target level.</FP>
  <FP>5. In light of the fact that imports have not declined as much as anticipated and capacity utilization has not increased to that target level, I have concluded that it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to adjust the tariff imposed by previous proclamations.</FP>
  <FP>6. In the Secretary's January 2018 report, the Secretary recommended that I consider applying a higher tariff to a list of specific countries should I determine that all countries should not be subject to the same tariff. One of the countries on that list was the Republic of Turkey (Turkey). As the Secretary explained in that report, Turkey is among the major exporters of steel to the United States for domestic consumption. To further reduce imports of steel articles and increase domestic capacity utilization, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to impose a 50 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported from Turkey, beginning on August 13, 2018. The Secretary has advised me that this adjustment will be a significant step toward ensuring the viability of the domestic steel industry.</FP>

  <FP>7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are <PRTPAGE P="205"/>being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
  <P>(1) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of steel articles from Turkey, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. Clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 1 of Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), is further amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following three sentences: “Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union; (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea; and (c) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 13, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey. Further, except as otherwise provided in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports from Turkey specified in the Annex shall be subject to a 50 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 13, 2018. These rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported steel articles, shall apply to imports of steel articles from each country as specified in the preceding two sentences.”.</P>
  <P>(2) The text of U.S. note 16(a)(i) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by deleting “Heading 9903.80.01 provides” and inserting the following in lieu thereof: “Except as provided in U.S. note 16(a)(ii), which applies to products of Turkey that are provided for in heading 9903.80.02, heading 9903.80.01 provides”.</P>

  <P>(3) U.S. note 16(a)(ii) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is re-designated as U.S. note 16(a)(iii) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS.<PRTPAGE P="206"/>
  </P>
  <P>(4) The following new U.S. note 16(a)(ii) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is inserted in numerical order: “(ii) Heading 9903.80.02 provides the ordinary customs duty treatment of iron or steel products of Turkey, pursuant to the article description of such heading. For any such products that are eligible for special tariff treatment under any of the free trade agreements or preference programs listed in general note 3(c)(i) to the tariff schedule, the duty provided in this heading shall be collected in addition to any special rate of duty otherwise applicable under the appropriate tariff subheading, except where prohibited by law. Goods for which entry is claimed under a provision of chapter 98 and which are subject to the additional duties prescribed herein shall be eligible for and subject to the terms of such provision and applicable U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) regulations, except that duties under subheading 9802.00.60 shall be assessed based upon the full value of the imported article. No claim for entry or for any duty exemption or reduction shall be allowed for the iron or steel products enumerated in subdivision (b) of this note under a provision of chapter 99 that may set forth a lower rate of duty or provide duty-free treatment, taking into account information supplied by CBP, but any additional duty prescribed in any provision of this subchapter or subchapter IV of chapter 99 shall be imposed in addition to the duty in heading 9903.80.02.”.</P>
  <P>(5) Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of U.S. note 16 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS are each amended by replacing “heading 9903.80.01” with “headings 9903.80.01 and 9903.80.02”.</P>
  <P>(6) The “Article description” for heading 9903.80.01 of the HTSUS is amended by replacing “of Brazil” with “of Brazil, of Turkey”.</P>
  <P>(7) The modifications to the HTSUS made by clauses 2 through 6 of this proclamation and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 13, 2018, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.</P>

  <P>(8) The Secretary, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments directed by this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>
  </P>
  <P>(9) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since the founding of our great Nation, citizens have put their lives on hold to defend our liberty and protect their fellow Americans. Today, more than one million Americans proudly serve in the National Guard and Reserve. During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we take a moment to salute the employers and communities that support our citizen Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen.</FP>
  <FP>Nearly half of our Nation's Armed Forces are comprised of National Guard and Reserve members. These dedicated patriots train throughout the year to be mission-ready at home and abroad. They balance the demands of civilian life with military duties and are a vital component of our national defense strategy. Our National Guardsmen and Reservists serve with distinction in uniform on all fronts—whether it be mitigating the effects of natural disasters and emergencies on our soil, protecting our border, or engaging in combat operations around the globe. And when they take the uniform off, they apply their leadership skills and desire to serve our communities throughout every sector of the civilian world.</FP>
  <FP>Employers who understand and appreciate the critical mission of our National Guard and Reserve provide flexibility and unwavering support in the workplace that empowers Guardsmen and Reservists to make invaluable contributions to our all-volunteer force. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the employers nationwide who understand the importance of a strong and ready military. Offices, organizations, and businesses nationwide accept the inconveniences of disruptive schedules, temporary personnel shortages, and financial burdens, because they know that they are helping sustain and advance something far more valuable than their bottom lines. Guardsmen and Reservists bring invaluable assets of professionalism, commitment, teamwork, and discipline to our Armed Forces and to America's businesses.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to caring for our military members, veterans, and their families. Many civilian employers share this unwavering dedication and devotion, and they deserve our deepest gratitude. I encourage all Americans to support our brave Guardsmen, Reservists, and their families because of their incalculable sacrifices to secure and maintain our freedom. Let us remember that the generosity, flexibility, and selflessness of their civilian employers are critical to their ability to serve our country most effectively.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 19 through August 25, 2018, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt thanks to the civilian employers who provide critical support to the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve. I also call on State and <PRTPAGE P="209"/>local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Women's Equality Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Women's Equality Day, we commemorate the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which secured for women the right to vote. The anniversary of this milestone is an appropriate time to reflect on the remarkable accomplishments of women in every facet of American life. It is also an opportunity to honor women for their leadership in service to their families, their communities, and the Nation.</FP>
  <FP>In the same spirit of the 19th Amendment, we must continue to seek an environment of opportunity for all women. My Administration, therefore, continues to support the advancement of women throughout our country. The economy is growing and increasing opportunities to work and thrive as a result of our economic policies, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the elimination of unnecessary and burdensome regulations. The unemployment rate for women has recently reached a 65-year low. We also fought for working parents by securing a doubling of the child tax credit, the creation of the dependent care credit, and the largest ever expansion of the child and dependent care credit. These family-friendly reforms will give much-needed financial relief to hardworking parents. Additionally, my Administration recognizes the challenges faced by mothers in the workplace due to lack of paid leave and affordable, high-quality childcare. That is why my budget this year, as it did last year, includes a national paid parental leave program. We continue to call on the Congress to enact such a program into law to help women thrive in the labor force and provide for their families. Further, we are working to enhance access to education and training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics for the next generation of women pursuing careers in these fields.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we celebrate the passion and unwavering dedication of the women who struggled and persevered in the fight for suffrage, and we recognize the countless ways that women strengthen the fabric of the Nation. We all benefit from the leadership and ingenuity of women in education, medicine, government, law, business, military service, and every other field contributing to the greatness of this Nation.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2018, as <PRTPAGE P="210"/>Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to celebrate the achievements of women and observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended action to adjust the imports of aluminum articles so that such imports will not threaten <PRTPAGE P="211"/>to impair the national security. The Secretary also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient domestic production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude aluminum articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based considerations.</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of these aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further authorized the Secretary to provide relief from these additional duties for any aluminum article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and also to provide such relief based on specific national security considerations.</FP>
  <FP>3. Consistent with the Secretary's recommendation that I authorize him to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient domestic production of comparable products, or for specific national security-based considerations, I have determined to authorize the Secretary to provide relief from quantitative limitations on aluminum articles adopted pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, including those set forth in Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), on the same basis as the Secretary is currently authorized to provide relief from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704.</FP>
  <FP>4. In light of my determinations, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff or quotas imposed by previous proclamations. It is my judgment that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff and quota levels. As directed in Proclamation 9704, the Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform me of any circumstances that, in his opinion, might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.</FP>
  <FP>5. The United States continues to hold discussions with countries on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imports. Should these discussions result in an agreement concerning such alternative means, I will take further action as appropriate.</FP>
  <FP>6. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>

  <FP>7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, <PRTPAGE P="212"/>and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
  <P>(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and such other senior Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, is hereby authorized to provide relief from the quantitative limitations applicable to aluminum articles described in subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for any aluminum article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality, and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations. Such relief shall be provided for an aluminum article only after a request for relief is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. Such relief may be provided to directly affected parties on a party-by-party basis taking into account the regional availability of particular articles, the ability to transport articles within the United States, and any other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate. If the Secretary determines that relief should be granted to a requesting party for the importation of a particular aluminum article, the Secretary shall publicly post such determination and notify U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the applicable quantitative limitation. Relief granted under this clause shall apply only to an article entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date on which the request for relief is granted by the Secretary. Until such time as any applicable quantitative limitation for a particular article has been reached, CBP shall count any aluminum article for which relief is granted under this clause toward such quantitative limitation at the time when such aluminum article is entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. Any aluminum article for which relief is granted under this clause shall not be subject to the additional rate of duty set forth in Proclamation 9704, as amended. Aluminum articles for which relief is granted under this clause shall be subject to the duty treatment provided in subheading 9903.85.11 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as established by the Annex to this proclamation.</P>
  <P>(2) As soon as practicable, the Secretary shall issue procedures for the requests for exclusion described in clause 1 of this proclamation. The issuance of such procedures is exempt from Executive Order 13771 of January 30, 2017 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs). CBP shall implement exclusions granted pursuant to clause 1 of this proclamation as soon as practicable.</P>

  <EAR>Proc. 9777</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended action to adjust the imports of steel articles so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. The Secretary also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those steel articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient domestic production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude steel articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based considerations.</FP>
  <FP>2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of these steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further authorized the Secretary to provide relief from these additional duties for any steel article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and also to provide such relief based on specific national security considerations.</FP>
  <FP>3. Consistent with the Secretary's recommendation that I authorize him to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those steel articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient domestic production of comparable products, or for specific national security-based considerations, I have determined to authorize the Secretary to provide relief from quantitative limitations on steel articles adopted pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, including those set forth in Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), and Proclamation 9759 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), on the same basis as the Secretary is currently authorized to provide relief from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705.</FP>

  <FP>4. In addition, I have been informed that the quantitative limitations set forth in Proclamation 9740 and Proclamation 9759 have in some cases already filled for this year, and that projects in the United States employing thousands of workers may be significantly disrupted or delayed because imports of specific steel articles, which were contracted for purchase prior <PRTPAGE P="217"/>to my decision to adjust imports of these articles, cannot presently be entered into the United States because the quantitative limits have already been reached. In light of these circumstances, and after considering the impact on the economy and the national security objectives of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, I have determined to direct the Secretary to provide relief from the quantitative limitations set forth in Proclamation 9740 and Proclamation 9759 in limited circumstances.</FP>
  <FP>5. In light of my determinations, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff or quotas imposed by previous proclamations. It is my judgment that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff and quota levels. As directed in Proclamation 9705, the Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of steel articles and inform me of any circumstances that, in his opinion, might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.</FP>
  <FP>6. The United States continues to hold discussions with countries on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by steel articles imports. Should these discussions result in an agreement concerning such alternative means, I will take further action as appropriate.</FP>
  <FP>7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
  <FP>8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>

  <P>(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and such other senior Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, is hereby authorized to provide relief from the quantitative limitations applicable to steel articles described in subheadings 9903.80.05 through 9903.80.58 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for any steel article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality, and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations. Such relief shall be provided for a steel article only after a request for relief is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. Such relief may be provided to directly affected parties on a party-by-party basis taking into account the regional availability of particular articles, the <PRTPAGE P="218"/>ability to transport articles within the United States, and any other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate. If the Secretary determines that relief should be granted to a requesting party for the importation of a particular steel article, the Secretary shall publicly post such determination and notify U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the applicable quantitative limitation. Relief granted under this clause shall apply only to an article entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date on which the request for relief is granted by the Secretary. Until such time as any applicable quantitative limitation for a particular article has been reached, CBP shall count any steel article for which relief is granted under this clause toward such quantitative limitation at the time when such steel article is entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. Any steel article for which relief is granted under this clause shall not be subject to the additional rate of duty set forth in Proclamation 9705, as amended. Steel articles for which relief is granted under this clause shall be subject to the duty treatment provided in subheading 9903.80.60 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as established by the Annex to this proclamation.</P>

  <P>(2) The Secretary shall, on an expedited basis, grant relief from the quantitative limitations set forth in Proclamation 9740 and Proclamation 9759 and their accompanying annexes for any steel article where (i) the party requesting relief entered into a written contract for production and shipment of such steel article before March 8, 2018; (ii) such contract specifies the quantity of such steel article that is to be produced and shipped to the United States consistent with a schedule contained in such contract; (iii) such steel article is to be used to construct a facility in the United States and such steel article cannot be procured from a supplier in the United States to meet the delivery schedule and specifications contained in such contract; (iv) the payments made pursuant to such contract constitute 10 percent or less of the cost of the facility under construction; and (v) lack of relief from the quantitative limitations on such steel article would significantly disrupt or delay completion of the facility being constructed in the United States with the steel article specified in such contract. Until such time as any applicable quantitative limitation for a particular article has been reached, CBP shall count any steel article for which relief is granted under this clause toward such quantitative limitation at the time when such steel article is entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. Any steel article for which relief is granted under this clause shall be subject to the additional rate of duty set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by this proclamation, when such steel article is entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. This rate of duty is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such steel article. Any steel article provided relief under this clause must be entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or before March 31, 2019, and may not be granted further relief by the Secretary under clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, as amended. Steel articles for which relief is granted under this clause shall be subject to the duty treatment provided in subheading 9903.80.61 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as established by the Annex to this proclamation.<PRTPAGE P="219"/>
  </P>
  <P>(3) The Secretary shall grant relief under clause 2 of this proclamation only upon receipt of a sworn statement signed by the chief executive officer and the chief legal officer of the party requesting relief. Such statement shall attest that (i) the steel article for which relief is sought and the associated contract meet all of the criteria for relief set forth in clause 2 of this proclamation; (ii) the party requesting relief will accurately report to CBP, in the manner that CBP prescribes, the quantity of steel articles entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, pursuant to any grant of relief; and (iii) the quantity of steel articles entered pursuant to a grant of relief will not exceed the quantity specified in such contract for delivery on or before March 31, 2019. Upon granting relief under clause 2 of this proclamation, the Secretary shall notify CBP and publish a notice of relief for the quantity of steel articles specified in such contract that are scheduled for delivery on or before March 31, 2019. The Secretary shall revoke any grant of relief under clause 2 of this proclamation if the Secretary determines at any time after such grant that the criteria for relief have not been met and may, if the Secretary deems it appropriate, notify the Attorney General of the facts that led to such revocation.</P>
  <P>(4) As soon as practicable, the Secretary shall issue procedures for the requests for exclusion described in clause 1 of this proclamation. The issuance of such procedures is exempt from Executive Order 13771 of January 30, 2017 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs). CBP shall implement exclusions granted pursuant to clause 1 or relief provided under clause 2 of this proclamation as soon as practicable.</P>
  <P>(5) Clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by Proclamation 9711, is further amended by striking the fourth and fifth sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following two sentences: “If the Secretary determines that a particular steel article should be excluded, the Secretary shall publicly post such determination and notify U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the duties described in clause 2 of this proclamation. For merchandise entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date the duty established under this proclamation is effective and with respect to which liquidation is not final, such relief shall be retroactive to the date the request for relief was accepted by the Department of Commerce.”.</P>
  <P>(6) In order to establish the duty rate on imports of steel articles for which relief is granted under clause 2 of this proclamation, clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, is further amended by striking the last sentence and inserting in lieu thereof the following two sentences: “All steel articles imports covered by subheading 9903.80.61, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to the additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty established herein with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on the date specified in a determination by the Secretary granting relief. These rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported steel articles, shall apply to imports of steel articles from each country as specified in the preceding three sentences.”.</P>

  <P>(7) Where the government of a country identified in the superior text to subheadings 9903.80.05 through 9903.80.58 of subchapter III of chapter 99 <PRTPAGE P="220"/>of the HTSUS notifies the United States that it has established a mechanism for the certification of exports to the United States of products covered by the quantitative limitations applicable to these subheadings, and where such mechanism meets the operational requirements for participation in an export certification system administered by the United States, CBP, in consultation with the Secretary, USTR, and other relevant executive departments and agencies, may require that importers of these products furnish relevant export certification information in order to qualify for the treatment set forth in subheadings 9903.80.05 through 9903.80.58. Where CBP adopts such a requirement, it shall publish in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E> notice of the requirement and procedures for the submission of relevant export certification information. No article that is subject to the export certification requirement announced in such notice may be entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the effective date specified in such notice, except upon presentation of a valid and properly executed certification, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the notice.</P>
  <P>(8) Subdivision (c) of U.S. note 16 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by inserting at the end the following new sentence: “Pursuant to subheadings 9903.80.60 and 9903.80.61 and superior text thereto, the Secretary may provide that any excluded product shall be granted entry into the customs territory of the United States when the applicable quantitative limitation has filled for the specified period for such good.”.</P>
  <P>(9) Subdivision (d) of U.S. note 16 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by inserting after “9903.80.58” the phrase “and 9903.80.60 and 9903.80.61”.</P>
  <P>(10) The rate of duty specified in the HTSUS in the general column for heading 9903.80.01 is amended by striking “25%” and inserting in lieu thereof: “The duty provided in the applicable subheading + 25%”.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we reaffirm our commitment to addressing the stigma of addiction and take the opportunity to remind all Americans that recovery is possible. We stand with those who are seeking treatment and provide our steadfast support to all who are suffering from and fighting addiction.</FP>
  <FP>Addiction to alcohol and other drugs affects millions of Americans. We must aggressively work to end this crisis, which endangers the safety, security, and well-being of all Americans. Addiction threatens everything that is great about our country—it shatters relationships between family members, replaces self-sufficiency with dependency, depletes our workforce of talent, and riddles communities with violence and disorder. We cannot stand idle and allow those we love to suffer from alcohol or drug addiction; we must be leaders and help guide our friends and neighbors to live drug-free.</FP>
  <FP>Every American has a role to play in stopping alcohol misuse and illicit drug use and in addressing their consequences. I am committed to taking action to keep drugs from pouring into our country and to help those who are affected by them. In March, I announced an Administration-wide Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand. The Initiative is designed to reduce the demand for drugs through education, awareness, and prevention of opioid overprescription; expand access to evidence-based treatment and recovery support services; and cut off the flow of illicit drugs across our borders and throughout American communities. Further, my Administration has worked with the Congress to secure more than $6 billion in new funding to help combat the drug abuse and opioid epidemic through prevention, treatment and recovery, interdiction, and law enforcement efforts.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we express our gratitude to our Nation's first responders, healthcare providers, and all family, friends, and advocates striving against alcohol and drug addiction. We celebrate the millions of Americans who are in recovery and who contribute every day to our efforts to stop drug use and addiction. Their experiences and persistence reinforce the value and importance of remaining hopeful and resilient when faced with grave challenges. Finally, let us encourage all Americans who struggle with addiction to realize that recovery is possible.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THERFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2018 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.<PRTPAGE P="224"/>

  <EAR>Proc. 9779</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Preparedness Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>National Preparedness Month is a time to focus our attention on the importance of preparing our families, homes, businesses, and communities for disasters that threaten our lives, property, and homeland. During this time, we also honor the brave men and women who selflessly respond to crises and disasters, rendering aid to those in need. These first responders, who work tirelessly to safeguard our Nation and protect our citizens, deserve our utmost gratitude and appreciation.</FP>
  <FP>Over the past year, communities nationwide and across the Territories have witnessed and endured damage from multiple hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods, volcanic eruptions, and other natural disasters. The historic hurricane season of 2017 included three catastrophic storms that made landfall within a month, and was followed by a destructive series of wildfires in California. Combined, these natural disasters affected 47 million people and tens of thousands were mobilized to provide aid, comfort, and assistance. We are also especially mindful of those currently affected by ongoing wildfires in California, Oregon, and Colorado. In spite of tremendous challenges, the resilience of the American people continues to prevail.</FP>

  <FP>Tragedies are somber reminders that preparedness is a shared responsibility and that it is critical to maintain readiness. All Americans can prepare for potential disasters by developing and practicing a family emergency response plan, assembling a disaster supply kit, signing up for alerts on mobile devices, setting aside emergency savings, and maintaining adequate insurance policies for their homes and businesses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's <E T="03">Ready Campaign</E> outlines other important steps to best prepare for a major disaster.</FP>
  <FP>This month, I encourage all Americans to take the opportunity to ensure they have an emergency response plan in place and ready to be properly executed. Emergencies and disasters test the resilience and strength of families, communities, and our Nation. It is impossible to avoid every challenge and threat, but we can and must prepare for them. By doing so, we can help protect our communities and save lives.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2018 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans, including Federal, State, and local officials, to take action to be prepared for disaster or emergency by making and practicing their emergency response plans. Each step <PRTPAGE P="225"/>we take to become better prepared makes a real difference in how our families and communities will respond and persevere when faced with the unexpected.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Labor Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Labor Day, we celebrate the American worker: the bulwark of our national prosperity and the cornerstone of our national greatness. Since taking office, my Administration has sought to restore the obligation of loyalty and allegiance that this Nation's Government owes to its workers. In all economic decisions, we believe in our sovereign obligation to defend and protect our country's workforce, and to seek its economic interests above that of any other country. America's workers pay our taxes, support our values, serve in our military, raise our children, protect our Constitution, and build our communities. They deserve, in return, the unwavering fidelity of their Government.</FP>
  <FP>Guided by this obligation, my Administration has taken historic action to advance prosperity for the American worker: cutting their taxes, eliminating regulations that threaten their jobs, unleashing American energy that powers their lives, restoring American manufacturing, and ending the transfer of wealth out of our country through disastrous trade deals that gutted our industries and our national strength. The result of our pro-America economic policies have been extraordinary: currently, in America, there are a record 162 million people working; initial claims for jobless benefits are at their lowest in half a century; and the unemployment rate of 3.9 percent is historically low.</FP>
  <FP>We have also taken historic action to defend the American worker by upholding and enforcing the immigration laws enacted for their protection—and by seeking to reform our immigration system so that it protects the jobs, wages, and livelihoods of our Nation's workers. Further, as we honor the work of all those in our labor force, we are especially mindful of the dignity gained from a hard day's work. Thousands of Americans have found a renewed sense of purpose in our resurgent economy. The dedication, resolve, and pride of the American worker are the reason our Nation has achieved prosperity that was once thought unattainable.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is focused on investing in America's workers and ensuring all Americans are on a path to good paying jobs. In July, I signed an Executive Order establishing the President's National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, harnessing the expertise of leaders in business and education to develop a holistic, national workforce strategy to promote access to affordable, relevant <PRTPAGE P="226"/>education and job training opportunities. I have called on companies nationwide to sign our Pledge to America's Workers and commit to investing in their current and future workforce by expanding education and reskilling programs. Already, many companies have answered that call, pledging to train and retrain more than 4.2 million American students and workers for new career opportunities across the country. Earlier this summer, I signed into law a reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act to provide students and workers with the skills necessary to succeed in a 21st century economy. I have also called for reforming the Federal Work-Study program, so that more Federal dollars go toward helping students—especially lower-income students—have more meaningful workplace experiences. And I have proposed to allow students to use Pell Grant funding to pay for cutting-edge, short-term programs that lead to quick and efficient transitions into the workforce.</FP>
  <FP>We also recognize and honor the proud and historic role of our Nation's labor unions in advocating for the interests of the American worker and wage-earner—and we have kept our promise to always keep the White House door open to members and leaders of our country's labor organizations.</FP>
  <FP>Further, as promised, I am renegotiating trade agreements to obtain fairer terms for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. For the past year, I have been negotiating with Canada and Mexico to fix the North American Free Trade Agreement. Earlier this week, I announced that my Administration has secured a preliminary deal between the United States and Mexico that modernizes and rebalances trade between our two countries in a way that greatly benefits American manufacturing, agriculture, services, and other sectors. I have also notified the Congress of my intent to sign a trade agreement with Mexico—and Canada, if it is willing. The deal I intend to sign will help create more reciprocal trade that grows our economy. It will also support high-paying jobs for American workers and protect the intellectual property of our Nation's businesses and workers. In addition to these improvements in our United States-Mexico trade relationship, we have also agreed with the European Commission to work toward achieving zero tariffs, increasing United States exports, and addressing unfair trade practices. And we secured key amendments to the trade agreement with South Korea that will strengthen the manufacturing sector of the economy, generating increased job opportunities for American workers. We are also protecting our economy from unfair trade practices that threaten our innovation and technology.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During the National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we pause to honor the memory of the nearly 3,000 innocent people who were murdered by radical Islamist terrorists in the brutal attacks of September 11, 2001. We come together to pray for those whose lives were forever changed by the loss of a loved one. We strengthen our resolve to stand together as one Nation.</FP>
  <FP>Darkness, hatred, and death marred that fateful September morning, 17 years ago. Our Nation watched with stunned silence, tears, anger, and utter disbelief as multiple tragedies unfolded. Although shaken and heartbroken, we were not defeated. Even in the midst of the devastation and sorrow, the indomitable spirit of our country emerged, as first responders selflessly rushed into the heart of danger. The evil attacks, intended to warp our way of life, instead ignited a flame of national unity, strengthened our will, and mobilized our volunteer spirit. The faith of our Nation may have been tested in the avenues of New York City, on the shores of the Potomac, and in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, but our strength never faltered and our resilience never wavered.</FP>
  <FP>The passage of time cannot ever lessen our commitment to freedom, our heartbreak for those who perished, our compassion for those who lost a friend or loved one, and our gratitude for the first responders and other heroes who braved death to save so many. We must recommit ourselves to ensuring that future generations of Americans always understand this defining moment in our Nation's history. During these annual days of prayer and remembrance, we pray that all find peace in the love of God, courage to face the future, and comfort in the knowledge that those who were lost will never be forgotten. We pray for guidance, wisdom, and protection for the men and women in uniform who fight each day to protect America from terrorism, and we pray for the unity of our Nation, both in times of peril and peace.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 7, through Sunday, September 9, 2018, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States mark these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the ringing of bells, and evening candlelight remembrance vigils. I invite all people around the world to share in these Days of Prayer and Remembrance.<PRTPAGE P="228"/>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Patriot Day, we honor the memories of the nearly 3,000 precious lives we lost on September 11, 2001, and of every hero who has given their life since that day to protect our safety and our freedom. We come together, today, to recall this timeless truth: When America is united, no force on Earth can break us apart. Our values endure; our people thrive; our Nation prevails; and the memory of our loved ones never fades.</FP>
  <FP>Although that fateful Tuesday 17 years ago began like any other, it erupted into horror and anguish when radical Islamist terrorists carried out an unprecedented attack on our homeland. In New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, the enemies of liberty took aim on America, but their evil acts could not crush our spirit, overcome our will, or loosen our commitment to freedom. Through the dust and ashes, we emerged resilient and united—bruised but not broken.</FP>
  <FP>On September 11, 2001, the world came to understand the true source of America's strength: A people of an indomitable will and a society rooted in the timeless values of liberty. Our love of country was made manifest through the examples of Americans engaging in countless acts of courage, grit, and selflessness. Their actions gave us hope and helped to sustain us in the days of healing that followed. We were moved by the heroism of the passengers and crew aboard United Flight 93, who sacrificed their lives to prevent further acts of terror. We were inspired by police and first responders as they rushed headlong into burning buildings to rescue the injured and trapped, and as they courageously braved fire, smoke, and debris, descending deep into piles of rubble, ash, and twisted iron to search for survivors. We were stirred to service by the deeds of those who labored in the ensuing days and months, often in dangerous conditions, to help our Nation rebuild and recover. The noble sacrifices of these true patriots are forged into the great history of America.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we honor the memories of the souls we lost on September 11, 2001, and pay tribute to all of the patriots who have sacrificed their lives in defense of freedom. We pray for the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen currently serving our Nation in harm's way. We thank the dedicated men and women who keep our homeland safe and secure. We applaud the unsung patriots in city halls, community centers, and places of worship across our country whose simple acts of kindness define the greatness of America.</FP>

  <FP>By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as “Patriot Day.”<PRTPAGE P="229"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2018, as Patriot Day. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we honor all American citizens of Hispanic descent and celebrate their rich and vibrant traditions of faith, family, hard work, and patriotism. We are grateful for the innumerable contributions they make to our society, which are vital to our thriving Nation. We are especially grateful for the 1.2 million Hispanic-American men and women who have answered the call to serve in our Armed Forces, demonstrating remarkable loyalty, bravery, and dedication to duty.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is continuing to create an environment in which all our citizens have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. We have enacted massive tax cuts for families and businesses, which means more jobs and better pay. We are eliminating unnecessary and burdensome regulations that constrain our entrepreneurial spirit. We are finally fixing our Nation's broken trade deals so that we have free, fair, and reciprocal trade. As a result of our efforts, our Nation's unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in 50 years, and the Hispanic-American unemployment and poverty rates have dropped to their lowest rates on record.</FP>

  <FP>Hispanic Americans help reinforce our relationship with our Latin American neighbors as we work to bolster liberty in the region and achieve free and fair trade with our regional partners. In April, Vice President Mike Pence joined leaders from the Pan-American region at the Summit of the Americas to affirm our collective commitment to liberty and government accountability and to confronting threats to freedom in places such as Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. We will continue to collaborate with Latin American and Caribbean countries to strengthen our trade relationships and to ensure a freer and more secure hemisphere.<PRTPAGE P="230"/>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we recognize the vital contributions farmers, ranchers, and foresters make to our thriving economy. My Administration is committed to ensuring that these hardworking Americans, who provide our Nation and the world with food, fiber, fuel, and other essential goods, work in safe environments. As harvest time approaches, it is important to focus on the safety and health of our Nation's farmers and their families, especially those in rural areas, and raise awareness to some of the risks that accompany farming life.</FP>
  <FP>The men and women of our great Nation who work the land are among our country's greatest treasures, and we recognize that their labor is physically demanding and potentially dangerous. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 417 agricultural workers died from a work-related injury in 2016, with transportation incidents as the leading cause of death. As American agriculture continues to lead the world in both innovation and production, we must maintain efforts to address the hazards of farming by following safe standard operating procedures and pursuing effective farm safety education and training.</FP>

  <FP>Self-employed farm operators and their family members, as well as hired workers, manage and sustain our country's farm production operations. This healthy and productive workforce is critical to ensuring the long-term sustainability and success of family farms, ranches, and overall rural prosperity. This week, let us resolve to integrate safe practices and technologies <PRTPAGE P="231"/>into our agricultural production systems. Together, we can continue producing reliable food sources for a growing global market and population in a manner that keeps our farmers, ranchers, and foresters safe and healthy.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16 through September 22, 2018, as National Farm Safety and Health Week.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Gang Violence Prevention Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Too many of our Nation's communities are afflicted by terrible and senseless acts of violence committed by members of gangs and cartels. Horrendous, criminal acts have become increasingly common in our cities and towns where the notorious and savage MS-13 and other criminal gangs operate. During National Gang Violence Prevention Week, my Administration commits to continue its steadfast efforts to identify and eradicate the gangs that spread bloodshed, murder our youth, and lay siege to neighborhoods across our country.</FP>
  <FP>While my Administration has successfully indicted and convicted countless gang members, gang violence still destroys families and threatens our liberty. When street gangs smuggle drugs into our communities, violence, addiction, overdoses, and other criminal activities follow. Extortion, sex trafficking, murder, robbery, and witness intimidation are only some of the evils that trail in the wake of gang activity.</FP>

  <FP>Our brave law enforcement officers are fearlessly confronting gang violence. They routinely and courageously fight criminal organizations, even in the face of increasingly brazen, hateful attacks. The Department of Justice is partnering with State, local, and tribal law enforcement—including our Nation's 3,081 sheriffs—to bolster efforts to combat criminal gangs through comprehensive violent crime reduction initiatives, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods. Additionally, it is increasing the number of Federal prosecutors focused on gang violence and is providing enhanced training on gang investigations to State and local law enforcement agencies. Because <PRTPAGE P="232"/>of these efforts, we have already seen tremendous success in prosecuting gang-based violent crime and reducing the influence of criminal gangs.</FP>
  <FP>I have also instructed my Administration to aggressively address transnational criminal organizations, especially MS-13. Organized and led from Central America, MS-13 has entrenched its claws in communities from the East Coast to the West Coast. Its growing influence poses a serious risk to our country's youth and community safety. Through increased interagency efforts and the creation of collaborative task forces that include both Federal agencies and State and local law enforcement, we have made great strides in protecting our Nation's most vulnerable communities from MS-13's violence and greatly diminished its ability to recruit new members. Earlier this year, Operation Matador demonstrated the success of these efforts, resulting in the indictment of dozens of MS-13 gang members for Federal racketeering offenses.</FP>
  <FP>While this progress is promising, the scourge of MS-13 and other transnational criminal organizations will not abate until our Nation's borders are fully secure and those who seek to harm us are no longer able to exploit loopholes in our broken immigration laws. In the past year, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested more than 4,800 criminal gang members, including nearly 796 arrests related to MS-13. We are grateful for the often dangerous work ICE conducts each day to enforce the law, secure our border, and keep us safe. The Congress must take action to protect public safety and national security by providing the necessary resources to secure our borders and close the dangerous loopholes in our laws that leave our borders open to dangerous exploitation.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we rededicate ourselves to dismantling, and ultimately eradicating, criminal gang organizations, which threaten our way of life. Let us strengthen our resolve to protect our communities from gang violence and to ensure they are places where all Americans can live, work, and raise their families. We also reaffirm our duty to support members of law enforcement, who, every day, place their lives on the line to protect and save anyone in need—be it family members, friends, neighbors, or strangers.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of September 16 through September 22, 2018, as “National Gang Violence Prevention Week.” I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week celebrates the extraordinary contributions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and pays tribute to their rich legacy of promoting equal opportunities for high-quality education. For more than 150 years, these pillars of higher education have opened doors to brighter futures for many Americans. Their continued leadership in providing educational opportunities to a broad and diverse range of students plays an important role in our Nation's academic successes, with their graduates influencing and enhancing every sector of our economy.</FP>
  <FP>For decades after the Civil War, under the harsh inequality of segregation and racial prejudice, the overwhelming majority of institutions of higher learning excluded minority students. Despite these adversities, the visionary leaders of HBCUs empowered their students by providing them opportunities for academic success. These institutions have produced many leaders in business, law, government, academia, and the military, and the rigorous education they offer has contributed to our national economic competitiveness and shared prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to investing in HBCUs to help ensure that they can educate future generations of American students. Earlier this year, after my Administration's bipartisan collaboration with the Congress, I signed into law legislation that increased Federal funding to important HBCU programs by more than 14 percent.</FP>
  <FP>Today, there are more than 100 HBCUs in 19 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Combined, they educate nearly 300,000 enrolled students who will contribute their talents to bolstering our economy and serving our communities. This week, we reaffirm our support for HBCUs and recognize the profound influence they have had, and will continue to have, on our Nation. We are proud to support the tireless dedication of these institutions to advancing their students' full potential.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we acknowledge the devastating toll the opioid epidemic has inflicted on our country and its people, and we pledge to raise awareness of the dangers of prescription and illicit opioid abuse. As we continue our work to end this terrible crisis, I encourage all Americans to provide our families, friends, coworkers, and neighbors with the love and support they need as they strive to overcome addiction.</FP>
  <FP>Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of deaths resulting from injury in the United States. In 2017, approximately 134 Americans died every day from an opioid overdose, and more than two million Americans suffered from addiction to prescription or illicit opioids. Between 1999 and 2017, more than 400,000 Americans, including so many of our young people, have died from overdoses involving opioids. We must aggressively combat this epidemic affecting our communities.</FP>
  <FP>I have tasked my Administration with strengthening our public health and safety response to the opioid overdose crisis. In March, I released my Administration's plan to address the epidemic by reducing drug demand, cutting off the flow of illicit drugs, expanding access to overdose prevention and evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, and conducting research to improve prevention and treatment in the future. This interagency effort is providing targeted funding to States and communities to help people in need. Additionally, in February, I secured $6 billion in new funding for combating the opioid epidemic.</FP>

  <FP>As we continue to raise awareness regarding the opioid crisis, we must work to remove the harmful stigma and misconceptions surrounding both prescription and illicit opioid abuse. I encourage those whose lives have been affected by their own personal struggle with addiction or by the struggle of a loved one to share their stories. Through platforms such as <E T="03">The Crisis Next Door,</E> which the White House launched earlier this year, we are building a dialogue that has the potential to save thousands of lives.</FP>
  <FP>As we observe Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we reaffirm our individual roles in creating a stronger, healthier, and drug-free society. In every community, there is someone who is either fighting opioid addiction or susceptible to falling victim to it. And in every community, there is someone who could lend a helping hand. To any American currently battling addiction, whether you are in treatment or long-term recovery: we stand with you. To any American who wants to help: we have resources available to support you. Together, as one Nation, we can—and will—win the battle against the opioid epidemic.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16 through <PRTPAGE P="235"/>September 22, 2018, as Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On this day and during this week, we celebrate the signing of our Constitution, which has proved that Government established by the people through reflection and deliberate choice can thrive and endure, rather than devolve into chaos and upheaval. Our Nation began with the “honorable determination,” as James Madison put it, “to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government.” We recognize the Constitution's role in securing for our country the blessings of liberty; we salute the service members, statesmen, and citizens who have defended it; and we commit ourselves to the active citizenship that self-government requires.</FP>
  <FP>The Framers established a strong Federal Government able to provide the energy and stability its people require while simultaneously limiting its reach and reserving all powers not expressly assigned to the Federal Government to the States and the people. When the Federal Government acts, it must do so with accountability. We are a Nation of laws, and laws must be enacted by the people's elected representatives. The Constitution ensures that the Government acts only with the consent of the governed, as expressed by the representatives responsible to them. That vital safeguard is lost when obscure and unaccountable regulators impose unforeseen mandates on the American people or twist the plain meaning of statutes to regulate without authority from the Congress. Our constitutional system will be “of little avail to the people,” Madison said, when the law “is little known, and less fixed.”</FP>

  <FP>In my Inaugural Address, I promised to return power to the American people. As President, I have instructed my Cabinet and all agency officials to regulate only when, and how, authorized by duly enacted statute. I have also instructed agencies to eliminate regulations that are ineffective, that fail to address real-world problems, that are needlessly burdensome, and that prevent Americans from designing their own innovative solutions. I call on Federal agencies to make room for States and local communities, <PRTPAGE P="236"/>for religious and civic organizations, and for individual Americans to address problems with the ingenuity and determination that make our country great.</FP>
  <FP>On this day and during this week, I once again call on all citizens to reflect on the original public meaning of our Constitution. And I call on Government officials to be mindful that laws must be clear and intelligible, and enacted through an open, constitutional process so that the American people can hold their Government accountable.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as “Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,” and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as “Constitution Week.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2018, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and September 17, 2018, through September 23, 2018, as Constitution Week.

In doing so, we recommit ourselves to the enduring principles of the Constitution and thereby “secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.”</FP>

  <FP>Throughout American history, the men and women of our Armed Forces have selflessly served our country, making tremendous sacrifices to defend our liberty. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor all American prisoners of war and express our deep gratitude for the courage and determination they exemplified while enduring terrible hardships. We also pay tribute to those who never returned from the battlefield and to their families, who live each day with uncertainty about the fate of their loved ones. These families are entitled to the knowledge that their loved ones still missing and unaccounted for will never be forgotten.</FP>

  <FP>As a Nation, it is our solemn obligation to account for the remains of our fallen American service members and civilians and to bring them home whenever possible. We owe an incalculable debt of gratitude to these patriots who gave their last full measure of devotion for our country. For this reason, I have pledged my Administration's best efforts to account for our <PRTPAGE P="237"/>country's missing heroes. We continue to work to account for the missing personnel from the Vietnam War. American and partner nation search teams are also working tirelessly in South Korea, Europe, the South Pacific, and elsewhere around the world to recover and identify those who served in World War II, the Korean War, the Cold War, and other past conflicts.</FP>
  <FP>During my meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in June, I raised my concern for the thousands of grieving American families whose loved ones remain missing from the Korean War uncertainty. As a result, I secured a commitment from Chairman Kim to recover and repatriate the remains of those Americans who were prisoners of war or killed in action. Last month, we repatriated the remains of some of those courageous service members to American soil. As a result of this homecoming, two of our missing fallen have already been identified, renewing our hope for the fullest possible accounting of the Americans who have yet to be recovered from the Korean War. These recovery efforts are vital to fulfilling our Nation's promise to leave no fellow American behind.</FP>
  <FP>On September 21, 2018, the stark black and white banner symbolizing America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will again be flown over the White House; the United States Capitol; the Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs; the Selective Service System Headquarters; the World War II Memorial; the Korean War Veterans Memorial; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; United States post offices; national cemeteries; and other locations across the country. We do this, each year, to recognize those who have suffered the horrors of enemy captivity, those who have still not returned from war, and the families who have yet to lay their loved ones to rest with the honor and dignity they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we recognize the important contributions that America's hunters and anglers make to our society, our thriving economy, and our continued conservation successes nationwide.

  <FP>According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, more than 35 million Americans fished and more than 11 million hunted in 2016. These impressive numbers highlight our country's connection with the great outdoors, and also represent a tremendous boost to our Nation's economy. Hunters and anglers invest more than $70 billion each year on licenses, tags, equipment, travel, and more. From the waters of the gulf coast to the mountain ranges that reign over the West, American adventurers are supporting thousands of jobs and contributing to the revenue streams of all States.</FP>
  <FP>Hunting and fishing provide Americans new experiences to explore, protect, and learn about the vast frontiers of our environment. Sportsmen and women are our Nation's most committed conservationists. This is the result of spending time connecting with the land, water, and wildlife, and understanding the link between healthy habitats and thriving sporting opportunities. Hunting and fishing are premised on respect for wildlife and the formidable beauty of the natural world, and increase our appreciation for the food we eat, prepare, and provide to others. Hunting and fishing also keep our waters stocked and our forests healthy, ensuring that our country's public and private lands continue to provide both sustenance and sport for future generations.</FP>
  <FP>The traditions and ethics of hunting and fishing are inseparable from the American way of life and are at the foundation of our culture. My Administration is committed to keeping America's lands and waterways open for hunters and anglers to enjoy for years to come. We have already opened or expanded hunting or fishing opportunities on more than 380,000 acres. Today, we celebrate the rugged and enduring spirit of our Nation's hunters and anglers, and we acknowledge the countless benefits hunting and fishing bring to the United States of America.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 22, 2018, as National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon the people of the United States to join me in recognizing the contributions of America's hunters and anglers, and all those who work to conserve our Nation's fish and wildlife resources.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the women and men who courageously fight to survive, detect, treat, prevent, and support survivors of this devastating disease. Our Nation vows to honor the loving memory of those lost to this disease, and we pray for their grieving families. We reaffirm our ongoing commitment to defeat breast cancer through education, early detection, and innovative research.</FP>
  <FP>In the United States this year, more than 260,000 women and approximately 2,600 men will likely be diagnosed with breast cancer. The statistics are frightening and staggering, yet we are encouraged to know that survival rates have drastically improved in recent years due to increased awareness and innovative advancements in early detection and treatment. The First Lady and I encourage all Americans to be proactive in the crusade against this deadly disease. This includes seeking the advice of healthcare providers, who can better educate patients of the importance of getting appropriate cancer screening tests at the right time, knowing their family history and other risk factors, and making lifestyle changes that may reduce the possibility of breast cancer.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to supporting our Nation's dedicated researchers in their diligent efforts to advance medical breakthroughs that will save and improve lives. Earlier this year, I signed into law Federal “Right to Try” legislation, which provides those diagnosed with a terminal illness expanded options for treatment that could save their lives. Cutting-edge developments in the fight against breast cancer include interventions and treatments that are more effective and less debilitating. Recently, a groundbreaking national study found that most women with an early-stage diagnosis of the most common type of breast cancer can safely forgo chemotherapy. Such research will continue to assist medical professionals in devising optimal recommendations for their patients and help Americans make informed healthcare choices.</FP>
  <FP>American physicians, researchers, public health professionals, and advocates have made tremendous progress in the fight against breast cancer, which is evident by the decline in mortality rates from this disease nationwide. Each life is precious. For this reason, we continue to pursue greater understanding of this disease, support pioneering research, promote effective prevention strategies, and ensure broad access to healthcare screenings. Together, we can usher in a new era of hope in the fight against breast cancer and anticipate the victorious day when this disease no longer plagues our Nation.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2018 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of how Americans can fight breast cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials <PRTPAGE P="240"/>of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join me in recognizing National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we acknowledge the danger that cyber threats pose to our economy and public infrastructure, and raise awareness about steps we can take to mitigate and prevent future attacks. As these threats have continued to increase year after year, my Administration remains committed to bolstering our Nation's cyber defenses and strengthening our national security.</FP>
  <FP>Under my Administration, our Nation's cybersecurity is a Government-wide effort. Collaboration among all United States Government departments and agencies, including the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, Commerce, and Homeland Security, have improved Federal network cybersecurity, enhanced coordination with the private sector to protect critical infrastructure, strengthened our ability to detect and deter cyber threats, and expanded efforts to build the world's best cybersecurity workforce. To advance these efforts, on September 20, 2018, I released the National Cyber Strategy, the first fully articulated cyber strategy for the United States in 15 years. This strategy makes clear that the Federal Government will use all means available to keep our country safe from cyber threats and to protect the American people in the digital domain.</FP>

  <FP>While we are making great strides to help protect American businesses and individuals, the Government cannot secure cyberspace alone. The internet touches many aspects of our daily lives. Our ability to prevent and mitigate cyber threats will improve when all citizens adopt better cybersecurity practices to protect their systems and data. Each of us can contribute by requesting more security from the products and services we use; using multi-factor authentication on our digital accounts and devices; leveraging private, protected, and secure networks; limiting how much personal information and location data we share; and taking other actions to secure the applications we use every day. I also encourage every American to learn more about how to protect themselves and their businesses through the Department of Homeland Security's <E T="03">STOP.THINK.CONNECT.</E> campaign and the Department of Commerce's NIST Cybersecurity Framework.</FP>

  <FP>This month especially, I encourage all Americans to promote and improve online security. I also call on our industry and Government partners to <PRTPAGE P="241"/>work together to share information, build greater trust, and lead the national effort to protect and enhance the resilience of the Nation's cyber infrastructure. I encourage and applaud industry efforts to produce products and services with full-lifecycle cybersecurity. Through continued cooperation between the public and private sectors, and by practicing personal risk-management, we can strengthen our Nation's cyberinfrastructure for ourselves and for future generations of Americans.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2018 as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people, companies, and institutions of the United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to observe this month through events, training, and education to further our country's national security and resilience.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we recognize the achievements of Americans with disabilities whose contributions in the workforce help ensure the strength of our Nation. We also renew our commitment to creating an environment of opportunity for all Americans and educating people about disability employment issues.</FP>
  <FP>The American economy is roaring back as a result of my Administration's economic policies, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the elimination of unnecessary and burdensome regulations. More than 4 million jobs have been created since my election. On average, in 2018, more than 5.6 million men and women with disabilities have been employed each month, which is on pace to be the highest annual level ever recorded. Earlier this year, the unemployment rate for Americans with disabilities reached the lowest rate ever recorded. These are positive indicators, and ones that continue to highlight the incredible value that individuals with disabilities offer to the workforce.</FP>

  <FP>To accelerate this momentum and build on my promise to America's workers, I signed an Executive Order establishing the National Council for the American Worker. This initiative will develop a national strategy that guarantees American workers have the ability to learn the skills needed to secure sustained employment, especially in high-demand industries, such as medicine, science, and technology. This national strategy will outline policies to provide all Americans, including Americans with disabilities, more <PRTPAGE P="242"/>opportunities to work, earn competitive wages, and connect with others worldwide.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has also taken action to address disability employment issues, which includes encouraging those with disabilities to engage in the workforce, providing greater opportunities for their involvement, and preventing workplace injuries from occurring. For example, in September, the Department of Labor awarded nearly $20 million in grants to eight States for Retaining Employment and Talent after Injury/Illness Network Demonstration (RETAIN) projects. These projects develop innovative strategies that enable Americans who are injured or ill to remain in or return to the workforce. Each year, more than 3.5 million nonfatal work-related injuries and illnesses occur at a cost of $170 billion to the economy. When an illness or injury forces workers to discontinue employment, the loss can be devastating to both the workers and their families. RETAIN projects work because timely, coordinated, and effective support can help hundreds of thousands of workers who have been injured or fallen ill remain in their jobs.</FP>
  <FP>In addition to testing innovative policy solutions, this year, the Department of Labor helped 44 States adopt disability employment policies to meet their workforce needs, and the Department of Labor's Job Accommodation Network provided guidance on accommodations for workplace success to nearly 50,000 employers and to individuals with disabilities. To expand apprenticeship opportunities, the Department of Labor has created inclusive apprenticeship tools for job creators and more than 35,000 employers receive help with recruiting and retaining workers with disabilities through the Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration will continue these efforts, and renews its commitment to creating more opportunities for Americans with disabilities who want to provide for themselves and their families and contribute to their communities by participating in the workforce. My Administration also reaffirms its support for all the employers who hire Americans with disabilities, providing opportunities for success. It is important that all our Nation's job seekers and creators are both empowered and motivated to partake in our booming economy, and apply their unique talents and skills to the growing workforce.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved August 11, 1945, as amended (36 U.S.C. 121), has designated October of each year as “National Disability Employment Awareness Month.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 2018 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I call upon government and labor leaders, employers, and the great people of the United States to recognize the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities across our land.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Energy Awareness Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Energy Awareness Month, we recognize the remarkable role American energy plays in producing more abundant, affordable, and reliable power for our Nation and the world. My Administration is reducing regulatory burdens on the energy sector, developing innovative energy technologies, and building new energy-related infrastructure. Our agenda is fueling tremendous economic growth and forging a more secure future for our country and our allies.</FP>
  <FP>The American energy renaissance is pressing forward with stunning speed. The United States is becoming both energy independent and energy dominant because of the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people and the application of innovative technologies to energy production, transmission, distribution, and use. Recently, United States crude oil production rose to roughly 11 million barrels a day, making our Nation the largest global producer. Additionally, the United States is the world's largest producer of natural gas, and, in 2017, our coal exports rose by roughly 60 percent over the previous year. American energy dominance means the end of our crippling dependence on foreign energy, and that our industries have access to reliable, affordable, and diverse energy supplies that enable them to compete in the global marketplace. Increasing energy security is also ushering in a new era of American leadership around the world as we export more of our energy bounty to friends and allies abroad, freeing them from hostile dependence.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's increasingly innovative energy industry is proving that we can be responsible stewards of the environment while developing energy resources to grow the economy, lower costs, ignite job creation, and drive up incomes for American workers. From 2005 to 2017, the United States led the world in cutting energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, reducing them by about 860 million metric tons. Between 1970 and 2017, combined emissions from the six common pollutants dropped by 73 percent, all while our economy continued to grow. We are leading the world in the development of the next generation of energy technologies that will convert our abundant and diverse domestic energy resources, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables, into the useful energy services that power our economy. America's innovative minds and industrial might, not the mandates of international agreements, have made our Nation the world leader in producing energy more abundantly while simultaneously reducing emissions.</FP>
  <FP>America's future has never been brighter, and American energy is leading the way in providing jobs, opportunity, and security for our Nation. This month, we recommit to strengthening our energy security and to responsibly using our energy resources so that we can continue on our path towards energy independence and dominance.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and <PRTPAGE P="244"/>the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2018 as National Energy Awareness Month.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, we recognize the importance of ending and preventing substance abuse. We must remain vigilant in raising awareness about the harms posed by alcohol and drugs, including prescription opioids, and their high potential for addiction. We can—and we must—provide families with the information, skills, and resources to stay safe and strong. As a Nation, we renew our commitment to improving individual and community health through increased education on the risks of substance abuse. Our investment in prevention will help to further yield improved academic performance, healthier lifestyles, more successful citizens, and safer communities.</FP>
  <FP>Our country is reeling from the enormity of an opioid epidemic that has resulted in huge numbers of overdose fatalities, an influx of children in foster care, and too many families forever changed by the addiction or death of a loved one. In 2017 alone, it is estimated that we lost approximately 72,000 Americans to an overdose, and approximately 49,000 of those deaths involved an opioid. Fueled by prescription pain medications, heroin, and illicit fentanyl, the severity of the current addiction crisis requires immediate action. We must go beyond simply raising awareness about the harms and risks of illicit drugs, which is one reason why, last October, my Administration declared a nationwide Public Health Emergency to continue comprehensively and proactively fighting the opioid epidemic on every front.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is committed to helping overcome addiction in our country. This past June, we launched a public awareness campaign directed toward our Nation's vulnerable young people, helping them “know the truth” and “spread the truth” about the risks of opioid abuse. In August, we awarded a record-breaking $90.9 million to 731 Drug-Free Communities coalitions across all 50 States to help prevent youth drug abuse. We are also encouraging adult individuals and family members to share their personal stories on how this epidemic has affected them through platforms such as <E T="03">The Crisis Next Door.</E> Launched by the White House earlier this year, this initiative is helping to remove harmful stigmas surrounding opioid abuse and showing that this crisis can affect anyone from anywhere.</FP>

  <FP>This month, we reaffirm our commitment to helping educate our loved ones on the devastating effects substance abuse can have on our families, <PRTPAGE P="245"/>our communities, and our Nation. I call on parents, educators, mentors, employers, healthcare professionals, law enforcement officials, faith and community leaders, and Americans to support evidence-based prevention programs. Through our united advocacy and awareness efforts on the horrific dangers of substance abuse, we can cultivate a society focused on health, wellness, and prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2018 as National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to engage in appropriate programs and activities to promote comprehensive substance abuse prevention efforts within their communities.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Courageous Americans of every generation have given their last full measure of devotion in defense of our country and our freedom. The families who stood alongside these heroes have paid a price no family should ever have to pay. Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day is a solemn reminder that these families—the families of our fallen service members—bear the burden of their loss forever.</FP>
  <FP>A century ago, President Woodrow Wilson approved a recommendation by the Women's Committee of National Defenses for mothers to display a gold star on an armband of black cloth to enhance public recognition for the loss of their children in World War I. Since then, millions of families have tragically traded in blue stars for heroes fighting for America for gold stars of the fallen—a badge of honor they wished they would never have to hold.</FP>
  <FP>Although they have suffered unimaginable sorrow, Gold Star families have charged forward with inspiring strength and determination, giving selflessly to their communities and our country. They support our men and women in uniform, our wounded warriors, and our veterans. Their unselfish leadership fosters patriotism and encourages us to consider what we can do to be better citizens.</FP>

  <FP>We will never forget those who nobly gave their lives in service to our country. Today, we pay tribute to these brave men and women in uniform by honoring the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters who have wounds in their hearts that will never be fully healed. We will continue to support them as they supported our country by selflessly sharing their loved ones for the noble cause of freedom. Let <PRTPAGE P="246"/>us pledge our deep and everlasting respect and gratitude to our Gold Star families.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as “Gold Star Mother's Day.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 30, 2018, as Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag of the United States over Government buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of our Nation's gratitude and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and Families.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Child Health Day, we renew our commitment to ensuring the health and well-being of our young people, who are the future of our great country. All children deserve to grow up in loving homes with parents or guardians who are dedicated to empowering them to live healthy, safe, and successful lives.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is actively working to create environments in which families can grow stronger and children can realize their full potential. Earlier this year, I signed into law a 5-year authorization of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which helps at-risk families get off to a better and healthier start with evidence-based home visiting programs. Home visiting programs help prevent child abuse and neglect, support positive parenting, improve maternal and child health, and promote child development and school readiness. Additionally, through the Be Best initiative, led by First Lady Melania Trump, we are helping to address some of the most prevalent challenges facing children, including destructive online habits, bullying, mental health, and alcohol and drug abuse. Further, we are strengthening our public health and safety response to the opioid crisis. One of the many tragic consequences of opioid addiction is neonatal abstinence syndrome, which poses risks to the long-term health of children.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Across our country, more than 15,000 children are diagnosed with pediatric cancer each year. Survival rates for most childhood cancers have improved in recent decades, but serious challenges remain. Children who survive cancer frequently struggle with significant complications later in life. For this reason, I signed into law the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act of 2018, which will provide more funding to research childhood cancers, explore effective treatments, and help enhance the quality of long-term care for children after active treatment and into remission.</FP>
  <FP>Every child, both born and unborn, possesses inherent dignity. Today, let us rededicate ourselves to our shared goal of building a better future for each one of them. As parents and role models, we have a moral responsibility to nurture and care for our most vulnerable population. Together, we can ensure that our children are healthy, and grow up to be happy and productive adults.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation in observance of this day.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Manufacturing Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On National Manufacturing Day, we renew our commitment to restoring America to its rightful place as a global leader in manufacturing. Revitalizing our Nation's manufacturing sector is a pillar of my Administration's economic agenda. Through clear-eyed economic and trade policies and advances made possible by cutting-edge research and development, American industry is thriving once again. Today, our country's manufacturers are more confident than ever before about investing in factories and workers right here at home.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is working tirelessly to create an environment wherein manufacturers and their workers have increased opportunities to grow and create jobs. Our economic policies, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act <PRTPAGE P="248"/>and the elimination of unnecessary and burdensome regulations, are delivering real results. Since my election, we have created nearly 400,000 manufacturing jobs. Last year alone, American manufacturers contributed $2.2 trillion to our economy; and in the past 12 months, the manufacturing sector has experienced one of the best job market performances in 23 years.</FP>
  <FP>Against this background, we continue to champion a level playing field for American manufacturers and American workers. I delivered on my promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) when I recently announced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). For years, NAFTA incentivized the offshoring of American businesses, and many manufacturing jobs left the United States as a result. Once approved by the Congress, the USMCA will rebalance and modernize trade between the United States, Mexico, and Canada in a manner that greatly benefits American manufacturing, agriculture, and services—and so many other sectors of our robust economy. Additionally, earlier this year, we revised our bilateral trade agreement with South Korea to strengthen America's manufacturing sector and bring back high-paying manufacturing jobs for American workers. Furthermore, in July of 2017, I issued an Executive Order that directed the Secretary of Defense to assess how to strengthen the manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chain resiliency of the United States. The Department of Defense has completed this assessment, and my Administration is committed to taking action in response to ensure that we can meet new and unforeseen challenges to our defense industrial base.</FP>
  <FP>The credit for the success of these efforts rests with our great American workers. That is why I have pledged to invest in both students and workers by providing opportunities for education and training that will help more hardworking men and women thrive in the modern workplace. In July of 2018, I issued an Executive Order establishing the President's National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. The order emphasizes our economy's high demand for workers with the technical acumen to fill open jobs in today's workforce. I also signed into law a reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which provides students and workers with the critical skills sought by manufacturers. We will continue efforts to provide our students with access to high-quality education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics so that they are better equipped to innovate and compete in today's economy.</FP>
  <FP>On this National Manufacturing Day, we acknowledge the changes that have swept across our economy, including the widespread adoption of innovative technology, advances in artificial intelligence, and the application of the internet to everyday objects and appliances. We recognize that these changes bring new challenges for our workers in a technologically advanced, increasingly dynamic world. With the same determination and resourcefulness that has always defined America, we rise to meet these challenges, and we proudly stand with our manufacturers and their workers as they continue to set the global standard for quality and innovation.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

They played a central role in establishing and building some of our great American cities, including Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Cincinnati, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and others. German Americans have made an indelible mark on business, agriculture, art, design, science, technology, and education. German Americans also have a proud history of military service, including the more than 200,000 who served in the Union Army during the Civil War.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Fire Prevention Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Fire Prevention Week, we renew our commitment to preparedness, fire safety awareness, and individual responsibility. We also honor our brave firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty and their families, as well as those firefighters who continue to put themselves in harm's way to safeguard our lives and property. Our Nation's firefighters are heroes, and they deserve our deepest respect and gratitude for the selfless service they provide to our communities.</FP>
  <FP>Each year, an average of 1.4 million fires burn in the United States, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries along with billions of dollars in direct property damage. This year, in the Western and Midwestern parts of the country, wildfires of unprecedented scale and scope have threatened local wildlife and the environment and have severely impacted local and regional economies through their devastating effect on agriculture and tourism industries. In many areas, I have declared the wildfires a major disaster and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts. My Administration remains committed to providing help to those affected.</FP>

  <FP>As we mark Fire Prevention Week, all Americans must be vigilant and take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of fire and to protect their families and property. It is critical to look for places in the home where fires can start, identify potential hazards, and take the steps needed to prevent these devastating fires. It is also important to regularly check and maintain smoke alarms, as these devices can provide life-saving warnings if there is a fire in the home. If a smoke alarm rings, it is essential to respond quickly, as you may have only minutes to escape safely. Furthermore, you should at least identify two ways to exit every room, ensuring all doors and windows leading to the outside open easily and are free of clutter. The National Fire Protection Association's <E T="03">“Look. Listen. Learn.”</E> campaign reinforces these basic but essential practices that every American must follow to help ensure fire safety.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we pray for all the Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial responders who are fighting wildfires and helping our communities recover, as well as for all those who have lost their loved ones or their homes due to these disasters. We also recognize the importance of actively practicing fire safety to help prevent fire-related tragedies from occurring in the future.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and <PRTPAGE P="251"/>the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7 through October 13, 2018, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 7, 2018, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Columbus Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In 1492, Christopher Columbus and his mighty three-ship fleet, the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria, first spotted the Americas. His historic achievement ushered in an Age of Discovery that expanded our knowledge of the world. Columbus's daring journey marked the beginning of centuries of transatlantic exploration that transformed the Western Hemisphere. On Columbus Day, we commemorate the achievements of this skilled Italian explorer and recognize his courage, will power, and ambition—all values we cherish as Americans.</FP>
  <FP>Columbus's spirit of determination and adventure has provided inspiration to generations of Americans. On Columbus Day, we honor his remarkable accomplishments as a navigator, and celebrate his voyage into the unknown expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. His expedition formed the initial bond between Europe and the Americas, and changed the world forever. Today, in that spirit, we continue to seek new horizons for greater opportunity and further discovery on land, in sea, and in space.</FP>
  <FP>Although Spain sponsored his voyage, Columbus was, in fact, a proud citizen of the Italian City of Genoa. As we celebrate the tremendous strides our Nation has made since his arrival, we acknowledge the important contributions of Italian Americans to our country's culture, business, and civic life. We are also thankful for our relationship with Italy, a great ally that shares our strong, unwavering commitment to peace and prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>In commemoration of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as “Columbus Day.”</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 8, 2018, as Columbus Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of the <PRTPAGE P="252"/>United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and all who have contributed to shaping this Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Leif Erikson Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>More than a millennium ago, Leif Erikson sailed across the frigid Atlantic and set foot on North America, likely becoming the first European to reach our continent. On Leif Erikson Day, we celebrate the extraordinary journey made by this son of Iceland and grandson of Norway with his crew and recognize the immeasurable contributions that generations of Nordic Americans have made to our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>After converting to Christianity in Norway, “Leif the Lucky” set out to bring the Gospel to settlers in his native Greenland. During his extensive travels, he landed on the northern Atlantic coast, expanding mankind's knowledge of then-uncharted territory. Centuries later, many Nordic families followed his example and set sail for America with the same determination and grit. After much struggle and sacrifice, these intrepid men and women arrived on our shores with hope for a better life.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we recognize the descendants of immigrants from Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland for the tremendous role they have played in developing the indomitable spirit that defines the American people. Nordic Americans have traveled in space, crisscrossed the globe by single-engine monoplane, and advanced knowledge in science and engineering. Nordic Americans have won Oscars, Grammy Awards, Pulitzer Prizes, and Nobel Prizes. They have fought—and died—in each of our Nation's wars.</FP>
  <FP>We also reflect on the deep and enduring ties we have with the Nordic countries. They are among our greatest allies in the fight against terrorism, and they are important trading partners. We renew our commitment to continue strengthening these transatlantic relationships.</FP>
  <FP>To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9 of each year as “Leif Erikson Day.”</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2018, as Leif Erikson Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the contributions of Nordic Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.<PRTPAGE P="253"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>This Nation—founded on principles of liberty and justice—has no tolerance for domestic violence. Personal relationships should be a source of comfort and support—a solid foundation for each person's empowerment and achievement in his or her daily life. Domestic violence dissolves that foundation, affecting millions of women and men every year. During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we reassert our commitment to eradicating this devastating crime so that homes are places of refuge and love—not of fear or violence.</FP>
  <FP>Horrific and criminal acts of domestic violence are unfortunately common in all areas of the world. While people of every race, sex, age, and socioeconomic status have suffered at the hands of abusers, the vast majority of domestic violence is perpetrated against women. Each of us has a moral obligation to speak up for those who suffer from physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. We pledge to advocate on behalf of those who have been assaulted at home, and to make every effort to prevent domestic violence from happening in the first place. We acknowledge the hard work of the many advocates, clergy, service providers, healthcare providers, educators, law enforcement officers, family members, and friends who assist and comfort those who have suffered physical or emotional trauma at the hands of an abuser.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration, in partnership with State, local, and tribal governments as well as public and private organizations, is working to ensure that offenders are prosecuted and survivors get the support they need to live lives free from fear, torment, and violence. My fiscal year 2019 budget proposal includes a $5.5 million increase in funding for programs administered by the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women, which would bring total funding to approximately $500 million. This office coordinates the efforts of diverse organizations to prevent and respond to abuse, and has awarded more than $7 billion in grants and cooperative agreements to State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private organizations since its inception. It also funds law enforcement efforts that hold domestic violence offenders accountable for their crimes. Each year, these officers respond to more than 150,000 calls for service, investigate more than 150,000 cases, and refer more than 70,000 cases to prosecutors.</FP>

  <FP>In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services is supporting initiatives to train healthcare providers to assist those who have endured domestic violence and implement initiatives that prevent domestic violence in the first place. Through the Department's Project Catalyst, clinics <PRTPAGE P="254"/>are checking patients for signs of domestic violence and connecting people in need to local service providers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's DELTA IMPACT program is also providing funding to State health departments to implement community and societal-level strategies to reduce the incidence of domestic violence in our homes and communities.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we recognize that, while our Nation has made strides in preventing domestic violence from first occurring and also prosecuting perpetrators who commit these horrible crimes, much work remains to be done. To ensure the protection of all Americans, especially women and children, we must strive to end domestic violence—in all its forms—from our society and help victims recover from abuse. And we must encourage Americans affected by domestic violence to seek help from those they trust and to never lose hope in the possibility of building a better life.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2018 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to stand firm in condemning domestic violence and supporting survivors of these crimes in finding the safety and recovery they need. I also call upon all Americans to support, recognize, and trust in the efforts of law enforcement, public health, and social service providers to hold offenders accountable, protect victims of crime and their communities, and prevent future violence.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Today, we pay tribute to the Polish immigrant and renowned military commander, General Casimir Pulaski, who gave his life for the cause of freedom during the American Revolutionary War. In the Continental Army, General Pulaski volunteered to serve alongside our Nation's forefathers in their cause for independence. His expertise on the battlefield, tactical insights, and creation of a highly effective corps of mounted infantry earned him the title of “Father of the American Cavalry.” On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we commemorate his legacy and draw inspiration from his stalwart commitment to liberty, the rule of law, and the sovereignty of the people.</FP>

  <FP>As a younger man, Count Casimir Pulaski developed a reputation for tremendous bravery while fighting with his father to free his native Poland from Russian control. When Russia nevertheless prevailed, Pulaski faced <PRTPAGE P="255"/>exile and crossed Europe into France. There, in a fortuitous turn of events for America, Pulaski crossed paths with Benjamin Franklin, who urged him to join the cause of American independence. Rising rapidly through the ranks of the Continental Army to the position of Brigadier General, Pulaski demonstrated uncommon and contagious courage on the battlefield, saving the life of General George Washington at the Battle of Brandywine and transforming a cavalry legion of Americans, Germans, Frenchman, Irishmen, and Poles into a lethal fighting force.</FP>
  <FP>On October 9, 1779, General Pulaski was severely wounded during the Battle of Savannah. Two days later, he died. In his memory, General Washington wrote that “[t]he Count's valor and active zeal on all occasions have done him great honor.” Although General Pulaski did not live to see the Star-Spangled Banner fly victoriously over the field at Yorktown, his legacy of heroism and sacrifice is etched into our history, alongside that of heroes like Marquis de Lafayette and Bernardo de Gálvez, and has inspired Americans for generations. By giving his last full measure of devotion for our freedom and independence, General Pulaski embodied the special bond that the American and Polish people cherish to this day. Indeed, more than two centuries after the General's heroic death, and 100 years since Poland gained its own independence, the United States of America and Poland continue to share a kindred devotion to the cause of freedom and to strengthening the bilateral relationship between our two countries.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2018, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate on this occasion those who have contributed to the furthering of our Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we celebrate the success of minority-owned businesses and recognize their contributions to our Nation's prosperity. These businesses are part of the bedrock of our economy, employing eight million people and contributing more than $1 trillion in economic output each year.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is committed to empowering minority business owners by creating an environment in which all businesses can expand and thrive. We have eliminated unnecessary and burdensome regulations and effected commonsense, pro-growth policies. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Importantly, it created <PRTPAGE P="256"/>the Opportunity Zones Program, through which we are rewarding businesses that invest in distressed communities and that create jobs for those who, all too often, are left behind. We are also leveling the playing field for American businesses by renegotiating and modernizing our trade agreements, including by replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.</FP>
  <FP>Taken together, these new policies are delivering real results for the American people. Our Nation's unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in 50 years. Minority unemployment rates have fallen to record lows, with the unemployment rate for African Americans falling below 6 percent for the first time in history. The unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has also reached historic lows.</FP>
  <FP>As minority-owned businesses continue to benefit from our resurgent economy, my Administration is looking to take additional steps to support these key drivers of economic growth. The Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency is expanding its focus to include policy analysis that will identify opportunities for minority business enterprises across our country. Additionally, the new National Council for the American Worker is developing a National Workforce Strategy. Given the historically tight labor market and recent technological change, our Nation needs a workforce strategy that champions effective, results-driven education and training to meet the needs of students, workers, and businesses.</FP>
  <FP>In the United States of America, each person has the opportunity to achieve their dreams and to build a better future for themselves and their families. Minority business owners exemplify this fundamental truth about our great Nation. This week in particular, we are grateful for the minority business owners who dedicate their time, energy, and entrepreneurial skills each day to improving the economy and restoring the American spirit in every community across the Nation.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 14 through October 20, 2018, as National Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon all Americans to celebrate this week with programs, ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of American minority business enterprises.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National School Lunch Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>School meals help ensure that our children receive the nourishment they need to grow, develop, and learn. During National School Lunch Week, we acknowledge the benefits of school lunch programs, which provide millions of children the opportunity to enjoy nutritious meals, providing them with the fuel they need to achieve their full physical and mental potential.</FP>
  <FP>The National School Lunch Program provides nearly 4.9 billion low-cost or free meals to approximately 30 million students each year. These meals are a dependable and consistent source of nutrition for many children in schools and childcare centers throughout our country.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration understands that we have a responsibility to children and taxpayers alike to ensure that school meals are nutritious and enjoyable. The best way to do that is to return control back to the people on the ground who make these programs work. That is why we have lowered regulatory hurdles and restored flexibility to schools and communities with respect to the menus in their cafeterias. School nutrition specialists and food service professionals work tirelessly each day to provide students with the nourishment they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond. We are committed to supporting them, listening to their feedback, and equipping them with the tools and flexibility they need to serve our children well.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we recognize the hard work of all the food service professionals, school administrators, community members, and parents across our Nation who help plan, prepare, and serve the meals that sustain millions of children. To emphasize the importance of the National School Lunch Program to our youth's nutrition, the Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in October each year as “National School Lunch Week,” and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 14 through October 20, 2018, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join the countless individuals who administer the National School Lunch Program in activities that support and promote awareness of the health and well-being of our Nation's children.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Blind Americans Equality Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Blind Americans Equality Day, we recognize the contributions that Americans who are blind and visually impaired make to our country, and the value of creating greater opportunities for all people to live full and independent lives. Despite facing challenges, Americans who are blind and visually impaired continue to achieve their dreams and strengthen our communities and our Nation. We remain committed to helping these individuals to be successful and achieve their goals in school, business, and civic life.</FP>
  <FP>As a Nation, we want all our citizens to have the opportunity to achieve their goals. In keeping with this fundamental tenet of American society, I signed an Executive Order establishing the National Council for the American Worker, which will develop recommendations for a national strategy that empowers American workers to learn the skills needed to secure sustained employment. This national strategy will outline policies that provide all Americans, including those who are blind or visually impaired, with more opportunities to work, earn a living, and connect with others worldwide.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration also supports Federal programs that help Americans who are blind and visually impaired obtain and maintain employment. The Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facilities Program, for example, has provided thousands of individuals who are blind with entrepreneurial opportunities to run their own businesses, generating millions of dollars in sales and substantial earnings. Under the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind Program, the Department of Education has issued grants to States to support services for individuals 55 and older for whom independent living goals are feasible, but whose severe visual impairment makes competitive employment difficult to obtain. These grants fund independent living services for older individuals who are blind and visually impaired, activities that improve or expand services for these individuals, and raise public awareness of the challenges these individuals overcome.</FP>
  <FP>By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628), the Congress authorized the President to designate October 15 of each year as “White Cane Safety Day” to recognize the contributions of Americans who are blind or have impaired vision. As we celebrate the achievements of all those who are blind or visually impaired, I reaffirm my Administration's commitment to providing more opportunities for these Americans to enjoy freedom and independence. Today, we rededicate our efforts and continue working to ensure that all Americans, including those who are blind or visually impaired, have opportunities to achieve success.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2018, as a day to celebrate and recognize the accomplishments and contributions of Americans who are blind and visually impaired.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>America is improved every day by men and women of great character and integrity who understand that a responsible citizenry is needed to ensure the independence and prosperity of our Nation. The Founders cherished opportunities to grow, including those that require one to experience, learn from, and overcome hardship. In difficult times, the American spirit is tested and defined by the character of its citizens and leaders. We have withstood this test time and time again. During National Character Counts Week, we recognize that our Nation's continued success depends on the American people's courageous resolve to remain united through times of both triumph and tragedy. We also pledge to foster good character in our communities and encourage children to form constructive habits.</FP>
  <FP>Character is nurtured in our families and communities. Parents and guardians have the unique responsibility to teach young people valuable traits, such as perseverance, courage, respect, and hard work. Teachers as well as civic and church leaders also play an integral role in helping our children adopt habits of good behavior. Good examples set by mentors empower youth to make smart choices that ultimately define them as individuals and us as a Nation. Every American should strive to live by example and never stop improving their character.</FP>
  <FP>Strong families, church communities, and civic organizations have a significant effect on the positive development of our youth. By empowering these strong networks, my Administration is encouraging them to help our youth to do their very best, learn from mistakes, and become leaders. First Lady Melania Trump's BE BEST initiative is improving the lives of young people by championing evidence-based programs that help our communities focus on the emotional, social, and physical well-being of our children. As social media and technology provide more opportunities for children to communicate with each other, their ability to influence others and be a force for good also expands.</FP>

  <FP>This week, especially, we refocus our efforts to be good examples—to our Nation's youth and each other—and to promote acts of service and leadership. We also express our gratitude to parents, guardians, teachers, civic and church leaders, and mentors for their vital work in raising children of strong character and integrity.<PRTPAGE P="260"/>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Each day, Americans use and benefit from high-quality products generated from our Nation's bountiful forests. During National Forest Products Week, we recognize that strong, healthy, and well-managed forests are vital to our Nation's economic prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>Forested lands make up one-third of America's total land base and allow for the production of paper and packaging materials; lumber for our homes, buildings, and bridges; renewable energy materials; and a myriad of goods for domestic and global markets. The forest products industry is one of the top 10 manufacturing sector employers in 45 States, producing more than $200 billion a year in sales and providing approximately $50 billion annually in payroll. Additionally, the industry's sustainable business practices and proper management of resources help us protect our abundant forests.</FP>
  <FP>A strong forest products sector stimulates job growth and bolsters our national and rural economies. My Administration is working to support effective, active, science-based forest management to help boost America's competitiveness and success in this modern industry. We support the industry's efforts to develop innovative ways of using wood in modern-day construction and are working alongside States, local communities, private companies, and tribal entities to support wood initiatives in construction markets. These opportunities provide potential pathways to new products, more jobs, and a reemergence of rural timber communities in an industry that is ready to expand.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we acknowledge the many ways our Nation's forests and woodlands contribute to our everyday lives through the raw materials they provide for numerous products, as well as the opportunities they offer for outdoor recreation. We also honor all the dedicated men and women who help to manage America's beautiful forests and ensure they remain among our Nation's greatest natural resources.</FP>

  <FP>Recognizing the economic value of the products yielded in our Nation's forests, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each <PRTPAGE P="261"/>year as “National Forest Products Week” and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On United Nations Day, we recognize the many ways the United Nations has contributed to peace and security among nations. Since it was founded more than 70 years ago with the aim of breaking the cycle of global conflict, the United Nations has provided a forum for nations to resolve conflicts peacefully in an increasingly complex world. The United States is committed to the organization's future and is confident that responsibility more equally shared among member states will lead to greater effectiveness and efficiency.</FP>
  <FP>The United States has, since the beginning, provided leadership and vision to the United Nations. Today, the United States continues to drive the United Nations forward, insisting on fundamental reforms that are needed to enable the organization to respond to the unique and evolving problems of the 21st century. Only when each country does its part can the highest aspirations of the United Nations be realized, and the financial responsibility for an organization like the United Nations must be equitably shared among its member states. Additionally, in recent months, the United States has pressed for crucial changes to improve the organization's performance, accountability, and responsiveness. The United States pursuit of reform, however, does not end there. Earlier this year, the United States sent a clear message about the need for change by withdrawing from the flawed United Nations Human Rights Council, which repeatedly rejected necessary reforms. We will not return until real reform is enacted, and we will not hesitate to take the measures necessary to protect America's interests or to better enable the United Nations to fulfill its purpose.</FP>

  <FP>The United Nations is an important forum for addressing the international challenges we face today. In the past year, the United States has taken bold steps, with the support of the United Nations, to address the global threat of nuclear proliferation; worked with partners to increase their capacity for <PRTPAGE P="262"/>sustained humanitarian response and with donors and implementing organizations to make humanitarian aid more efficient; supported United Nations Security Council action to improve the international response to regional conflicts; and brought attention to human rights abuses. The great progress achieved on these fronts harbingers the limitless potential of the United Nations to help confront these and other challenges.</FP>
  <FP>When the United Nations lives up to its lofty ideals, it is an invaluable forum for cooperation among the peoples of the world. On this day, we celebrate the combined efforts of member states to achieve the United Nations' goals of international peace and security and developing friendly relations among nations. We also acknowledge all the men and women who are serving around the world in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, and all those who work to keep our world safe from weapons of mass destruction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2018, as United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.DONALD J. TRUMP</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Camp Nelson National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Initially established as a Union Army supply depot and hospital, Camp Nelson, located in Jessamine County, Kentucky, was a key site of emancipation for African American soldiers and a refugee camp for their families during the Civil War. Camp Nelson was one of the largest Union Army recruitment centers for African American Union soldiers, then known as United States Colored Troops. During the war, thousands of enslaved African Americans risked their lives escaping to Camp Nelson, out of a deep desire for freedom and the right of self-determination. Today, the site is one of the best-preserved landscapes and archeological sites associated with United States Colored Troops recruitment and the refugee experiences of African American slaves seeking freedom during the Civil War.</FP>

  <FP>Between 1863 and 1865, Camp Nelson served as a bustling Union Army encampment, hospital, and supply depot. From it, the Union Army dispatched soldiers, horses, and other supplies to support military operations at the Cumberland Gap and the frontlines in Tennessee and Virginia. During this time, enslaved individuals sought to gain their freedom by fleeing <PRTPAGE P="263"/>to Camp Nelson and other Union military installations in Kentucky. They placed their hope in places like Camp Nelson even though slavery was then legal in Kentucky. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, to free slaves from bondage, applied only to jurisdictions in which the people were in rebellion against the United States. As a strategically important border State, Kentucky had remained loyal to the Union and, therefore, was not within the proclamation's scope.</FP>
  <FP>Kentucky was the last State in the Union to allow the enlistment of African American men. Beginning in April of 1864, however, the State allowed free African American men and enslaved men who had the express permission of their owners to enlist. Notwithstanding these limited avenues to enlistment, hundreds of enslaved men risked their lives fleeing slavery and arrived at Camp Nelson during the spring of 1864, with the goal of enlisting in the Union Army in order to gain their freedom and to fight for the freedom of others.</FP>
  <FP>As the pressure to meet recruitment demands grew, the Union Army was forced to allow all able-bodied men who were of age to join the Army. Kentucky, in particular, was unable to meet its draft quotas with only white soldiers. In the summer after enslaved men began to arrive at Camp Nelson, in June of 1864, more than 500 United States Colored Troops were mustered into service. In July, a record 1,370 new African American troops enlisted in the Union Army. On the single biggest recruitment day—July 25, 1864—322 African American men enlisted at Camp Nelson. By the end of the Civil War, more than 23,000 African Americans had joined the Union Army in Kentucky, making it the second largest contributor of United States Colored Troops of any State. More than 10,000 of these troops enlisted or were trained at Camp Nelson. Eight United States Colored Troop regiments were founded at Camp Nelson and five other such regiments were stationed there during the war.</FP>
  <FP>Many enslaved men who arrived at Camp Nelson in 1864 were accompanied by their families. Although enlisting in the Union Army allowed men to gain their own freedom, it did not have the same effect for their family members, who often remained slaves in the eyes of the law and struggled to support and defend themselves. African Americans at Camp Nelson who did not enlist built refugee encampments. And as United States Colored Troop recruitment continued to climb, so did the population of freedom-seeking refugees at Camp Nelson, despite efforts by the Union Army to break them up and return the enslaved individuals to their owners.</FP>

  <FP>The Union Army's efforts to remove refugees from Camp Nelson culminated in the tragic, forced expulsion of approximately 400 African American women and children during frigid weather in November of 1864, causing the deaths of 102 refugees. That tragedy brought national attention and public support to the plight of the refugees at Camp Nelson. In response, the Union Army established the Camp Nelson Home for Colored Refugees in January 1865, creating a safe haven for the wives and children of enlisted African American soldiers in Jessamine County, Kentucky. Influenced by these events, the Congress took action in March of 1865 by emancipating the wives and children of any enlisted member of the United States Colored Troops. This law protected the refugees at Camp Nelson. It <PRTPAGE P="264"/>also provided an additional incentive for African American men to enlist in the Union Army, and caused recruitment to steadily climb through the end of the war. In fact, as of the spring of 1865, Camp Nelson and the refugee home were at their largest, with thousands of new recruits, Union troops, refugees, and civilians working and living in hundreds of structures.</FP>
  <FP>In 1865, after the end of the war, the Department of War began the process of closing Camp Nelson. It took inventory of existing buildings and equipment and prepared to dismantle and abandon the camp. Many of Camp Nelson's military buildings, all of which were built as temporary structures to be used during wartime, were either sold and moved, or dismantled. Only a few structures, like the Oliver Perry house, which predated the camp's establishment, and the Camp Nelson Home for Colored Refugees, were left intact following the closure.</FP>
  <FP>The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, more commonly referred to as the “Freedmen's Bureau,” assumed management of the Camp Nelson Home for Colored Refugees during the post-war transition. Many of the African Americans who lived at Camp Nelson had envisioned that the refugee home would be a center for a thriving post-war African American community. The policy of the Freedmen's Bureau, however, was to remove all refugees from military installations. By October of 1865, all of the former Civil War refugee camps in Kentucky and Tennessee had been closed, with the exception of Camp Nelson. While the refugee home officially closed in 1866, approximately 250 individuals stayed and sustained a community there, which today is known as Hall, Kentucky. And although no original buildings remain from the Camp Nelson Home for Colored Refugees, the descendants of refugees and soldiers maintain connections to Camp Nelson, and some still live in the Hall community.</FP>
  <FP>The history of Camp Nelson is now told primarily through archival and military records, as well as rich archeological evidence from the site. The well-preserved in situ archeological resources associated with the military installation, recruitment camp, and refugee home provide robust opportunities for researchers to understand the African American experience during the Civil War. The broader Camp Nelson archeological record also provides opportunities for research and scholarship related to military history, race, identity, and gender during the Civil War—a pivotal chapter of the Nation's history. The preserved archeological resources at the sites of Camp Nelson and the Camp Nelson Home for Colored Refugees provide insight into what was once a place where formerly enslaved individuals experienced freedom and self-determination, and struggled to create a sense of home, amidst the chaos of war. Camp Nelson reminds us of the courage and determination possessed by formerly enslaved African Americans as they fought for their freedom.</FP>

  <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;<PRTPAGE P="265"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The world today relies on critical infrastructure, such as power grids, water and food supplies, election infrastructure, transportation systems, and communications networks, that is increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent. During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we emphasize the vital role of strong national infrastructure in the national and economic security of our Nation. By mitigating risks to our critical infrastructure, we can keep America safe, healthy, and prosperous.</FP>
  <FP>Cyber actors who aim to compromise or disrupt networks—often for monetary and political gain—are an increasing threat to our critical infrastructure. In September, I released the first fully articulated National Cyber Strategy in 15 years. The implementation of this strategy will strengthen America's defenses against cyber threats, help to secure our critical infrastructure, and protect cyberspace as an engine of economic growth, innovation, and democratic security. A key aspect of the strategy is strengthening existing partnerships with the private sector to thwart any threat and to protect critical infrastructure. By improving engagement between the United States Government and the private sector, we are better able to leverage the resources and capabilities of those who own and operate the vast majority of our Nation's critical infrastructure. Safeguarding our democratic processes is an important part of my strategy, and an imperative this election season. The protection and security of our election infrastructure, which is critical infrastructure, must be a top priority of the Federal Government and its partners across the country.</FP>
  <FP>We must also maintain our focus on other aspects of our critical infrastructure, which sustain our food supply, our fuel sources, and our means of trade. National disasters like the recent wildfires, floods, and hurricanes—as well as the activities of our adversaries—speak directly to the importance of continuing to enhance and protect it. Every day, the Department of Homeland Security is working with government and private sector stakeholders to assess and address risks of every type to our critical infrastructure.</FP>
  <FP>As we mark Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we express our gratitude for the increasing efforts throughout government and the private sector to keep our Nation safe, secure, and prosperous. And we reaffirm our commitment to using our collective skills, knowledge, and capabilities to protect our country from evolving man-made and natural threats by making the Nation's critical infrastructure more secure and resilient.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2018 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's infrastructure and to observe this month with appropriate measures to enhance our national security and resilience.<PRTPAGE P="277"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Adoption Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Adoption Month, we recognize the immeasurable love and support that adoptive parents and families provide to hundreds of thousands of children each year. We celebrate the life-changing act of adoption, bring attention to the millions of Americans who are eager to adopt, and express our gratitude to the families who have welcomed children into their lives and homes. My Administration also acknowledges the courage of those mothers and fathers who place their child for adoption. Our Nation grows stronger because of the love and sacrifice of parents, both birth and adoptive.</FP>
  <FP>Adoption is a blessing for all involved. It provides needed relief to birth parents, who may not, for whatever reason, be in a position to raise a child. It fosters loving homes for children. It enables individuals to grow their families and share their love. And it fosters strong families, which are integral to ensuring strong communities and a resilient country. To secure the benefits of adoption, we must continue to assist families who are willing to adopt children in need of a permanent home and support the adoptive families already formed. We must also encourage all Americans to recognize that adoption is a powerful way to show women they are not alone in an unexpected pregnancy.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is dedicated to supporting the children in foster care who are seeking permanent homes. Unfortunately, many youth leave foster care at the age of 18 without lasting family connections. These children deserve a permanent family, which can provide them with love, stability, support, and encouragement as they pursue personal, educational, and employment goals and confront life's opportunities and challenges.</FP>
  <FP>Adoption affirms the inherent value of human life and signals that every child—born or unborn—is wanted and loved. Children, regardless of race, sex, age, or disability, deserve a loving embrace into families they can call their own. This month, we honor the thousands of American families who have grown because of adoption. We also stand with those children in foster care, and we appeal to families, communities, and houses of worship across our great Nation to help these children find a permanent home.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2018 as National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month by helping children in need of a permanent home secure a more promising <PRTPAGE P="278"/>future with a forever family, so they may enter adulthood with the love and support we all deserve.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Entrepreneurship Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since the founding of our Nation, generations of Americans have drawn upon every last measure of grit and determination to push the limits of human knowledge, invention, and capability. Our Nation thrives today because bold entrepreneurs and innovators had vision and drive, stopping at nothing to realize their dreams. This intrepid spirit, which burns in the heart of so many Americans, kept Edison working into the candlelit hours, lifted Earhart to new heights, and put a computer in every home. And under my Administration's policies, optimism among our Nation's small businesses and entrepreneurs recently reached the highest level ever recorded. During National Entrepreneurship Month, we celebrate the Americans who forge new frontiers of possibility and prosperity, and we reaffirm our commitment to creating an environment in which they can continue to drive our country's economic success.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to policies that foster entrepreneurship and create jobs. For too long, an outdated and convoluted tax code discouraged investment and limited opportunity for millions of hardworking Americans. That is why, in December of 2017, I delivered on my promise to unleash the potential of America's economy by signing into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These unprecedented tax cuts and reforms eased the tax burden on entrepreneurs and expanded their access to capital, ushering in a new era of economic growth.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is also implementing historic regulatory reform, removing unnecessary and burdensome regulations, which have too often prevented our country's risk-takers from charting new paths of discovery. While working at every turn to protect consumers and the environment from harm, our deregulatory efforts have saved American families and business owners $33 billion. For the first time in modern history, Americans have experienced an overall decrease in regulatory burdens. We will not let up. Americans deserve a regulatory environment that facilitates innovation, rewards creativity, and allows the skills and dexterity of our entrepreneurs to shine.</FP>

  <FP>Americans of every race, creed, and socioeconomic background are benefiting from my Administration's whole-of-government approach to economic growth. For example, the Small Business Administration (SBA), through its Women's Business Center Program, is providing access to training and counseling specifically for women in business. The SBA is also <PRTPAGE P="279"/>embarking on an ambitious web-based effort to build awareness about resources available for Hispanic job creators. Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created new Opportunity Zones, which will attract billions of dollars in private-sector investments to revitalize distressed communities in America.</FP>
  <FP>These efforts are yielding extraordinary dividends. The unemployment rate in September hit its lowest level in nearly half a century. The unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans is at the lowest level in recorded history. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Asian Americans have also hit all-time lows. The same is true of the unemployment rates for African-American women and African-American youth. And businesses owned by African-American and Hispanic-American women are growing at a faster rate than any other category of female owned businesses.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Family Caregivers Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Family Caregivers Month, we pay tribute to the millions of Americans across our Nation who selflessly care for family members who are chronically ill, elderly, or who have a disability. We recognize the challenges of caregiving and celebrate the joys of bringing support and comfort to a loved one. We express our gratitude to them for the work they do daily to ensure their loved ones are able to live in their homes and communities.</FP>

  <FP>Family caregivers are the foundation of our country's long-term support system. Every year, nearly 44 million caregivers assist loved ones with a vast array of essential tasks, including eating, bathing, dressing, managing <PRTPAGE P="280"/>finances, childcare, administering medications, and arranging doctor visits and transportation. In performing these challenging duties with patience and compassion, family caregivers embody selfless service and sacrifice.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is strongly committed to ensuring that family caregivers have the support they need. Earlier this year, I was pleased to sign into law the RAISE Family Caregivers Act, which will help support the millions of family caregivers across our Nation and the individuals who rely on them. This bipartisan legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and make available strategies for recognizing and supporting family caregivers. It also establishes an advisory council that will leverage expertise from across my Administration and our Nation to address topics such as respite services and options, workplace flexibility, and financial security. It will also help people navigate the healthcare system and produce further recommendations for supporting family caregivers. Similarly, the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act, which I signed on July 7, 2018, will help our Nation better address the needs of people who provide full-time care for their grandchildren. Sadly, the number of people caring for grandchildren is growing, as the opioid crisis continues to ravage families across our country. I was also pleased to sign into law the VA MISSION Act of 2018, which expands caregiver assistance to eligible veterans who served our country before September 11, 2001.</FP>
  <FP>As anchors for their loved ones, our Nation's family caregivers promote a culture that values the dignity of life at all stages and the importance of family. This month, we acknowledge the dedication and compassion of all those who work to improve their family members' lives, and we renew our commitment to supporting them in their labor of love.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2018 as National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to acknowledge, and express our gratitude to, all who provide compassionate care to enhance the lives of their loved ones in need.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>During National Native American Heritage Month, we celebrate the legacy of the first people to call this land home. America's Native Americans have fortified our country with their traditions and values, making tremendous contributions to every aspect of our national life. We remain committed to preserving and protecting Native American cultures, languages, and history, while ensuring prosperity and opportunity for all Native Americans.<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>American Indians and Alaska Natives are both important components of the American mosaic. Native Americans are business owners creating good jobs for American workers, teachers educating our children, first responders assisting neighbors in need, and leaders serving their communities. This month, we especially recognize the immeasurable contribution of American Indians and Alaska Natives who serve in the Armed Forces at five times the national average. We also acknowledge the many American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement and who sacrifice their safety for the security of all.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to the sovereignty of Indian nations—including the rights of self-determination and self-governance—and ensuring economic opportunity from Window Rock in Arizona to the Badger-Two Medicine region in Montana. By engaging with tribal leaders as representatives of sovereign nations, my Administration is working to find effective solutions to pernicious challenges, such as generational poverty. Our partnership is furthering economic development and advancing needed reforms.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has also embraced all Federal agencies—especially the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Indian Health Service, and the Bureau of Indian Education—to improve the quality of services delivered to American Indian and Alaska Native communities. We are combating the destructive opioid epidemic, confronting human trafficking and violent crime, expanding educational opportunity, increasing collaborative homeland security approaches to border security, and improving infrastructure throughout Indian country.</FP>
  <FP>Earlier this year, I was pleased to sign into law legislation giving Federal recognition to six American Indian Tribes. The formal recognition of these sovereign governments is a symbol of our ongoing effort to restore self-governance and economic vitality to Native American peoples, and we welcome these tribes into America's family of sovereign nations.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation is proud of and grateful for its Native American heritage and traditions, including a history of innovation and entrepreneurship. The essential contributions of Native Americans continue to strengthen our American family and brighten our future together. This month, I encourage all Americans to learn more about American Indian and Alaska Native cultures as we celebrate and honor the many Native peoples who have given so much to our great Nation.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2018 as National Native American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities and to celebrate November 23, 2018, as Native American Heritage Day.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Veterans and Military Families Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Veterans and Military Families Month, we salute the brave and dedicated patriots who have worn the uniform of the United States, and we celebrate the extraordinary military families whose selfless service and sacrifice make our military the finest in the world.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's veterans represent the best of America. Generation after generation, men and women have answered the call to defend our country and our freedom, facing danger and uncertainty with uncommon courage. They make tremendous sacrifices by leaving their families to serve throughout the homeland and in combat, contingency, and humanitarian operations worldwide.</FP>
  <FP>Our heroes have always relied on their families for strength and support. Serving alongside our men and women in uniform are spouses, siblings, parents, and children who personify the ideals of patriotism, pride, resilience, service above self, and honor. They endure the hardships and uncertainty of multiple relocations, extended trainings, and deployments because of their admirable devotion to our country and a loved one in uniform.</FP>
  <FP>President Ronald Reagan said, “America's debt to those who would fight for her defense doesn't end the day the uniform comes off.” Our Nation's veterans fulfilled their duty to this country with brave and loyal service; it is our moral and solemn obligation to demonstrate to them our continuing gratitude, unwavering support, and meaningful encouragement.</FP>
  <FP>I am steadfastly committed to ensuring our veterans and their families receive the care and support they deserve. I was pleased to sign into law the landmark VA MISSION Act of 2018, which revolutionizes the way veterans receive healthcare and other services vital to their lives. The Department of Veterans Affairs is continuing to raise its standard of service, including through the establishment of the first national center of excellence for veteran and caregiver research, which will improve services and outcomes for patients and their families. I have also mandated greater collaboration across the Government to support veterans transitioning to civilian life. Additionally, Second Lady Karen Pence and I have collaborated on ways to elevate the career and educational opportunities for military spouses and children in partnership with State, local, and tribal officials.</FP>
  <FP>It is most appropriate that in this season of gratitude we stop to recognize veterans, military families, and those who gave their lives in service to this great Nation. We are indebted to these heroes for the freedoms we enjoy every day. I ask all Americans to join me in offering our sincere thanks to our veterans and the families who love and support them.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2018 as National Veterans and Military Families Month. I encourage all communities, all sectors of society, and all Americans to acknowledge and honor the service, sacrifices, and contributions of veterans and military families for <PRTPAGE P="283"/>what they have done and for what they do every day to support our great Nation.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>The Berlin Wall stood as a harrowing barrier for nearly three decades, dividing East and West Germans from their families and friends, and symbolizing the suffocating oppression of Soviet-backed totalitarian regimes. On World Freedom Day, we remember the struggle and sacrifice of those who braved severe hardships under communism's brutal reign, and we celebrate November 9, 1989, as the day when freedom-loving people on both sides of the wall came together to begin tearing down this hated obstruction to liberty. We also honor the unwavering resolve of those who confronted the <PRTPAGE P="284"/>evils of corrupt despots and reaffirm our support for people around the world seeking to live in freedom and to enjoy the blessings of liberty.</FP>
  <FP>As of this year, Germany has been reunified for longer than it was divided by the Berlin Wall, which imprisoned the people of East Germany for more than 28 years. While it stood, the Berlin Wall was both a physical barrier and a symbol of oppression. Few dared to dream of reunification. The courageous and unwavering determination of those who dared to confront it and those who guarded it day and night, however, inspired millions to prove that freedom prevails over tyranny. The fall of the Berlin Wall marked a major step in the disintegration of the Iron Curtain, paving the way to the liberation of Eastern and Central Europe from the grip of communism and marking a decisive victory for freedom-loving people across Europe. Many countries that lived under the shadow of communism emerged as new democracies and reclaimed their right to determine their own futures. Today, they continue to defend their cherished independence.</FP>
  <FP>Unfortunately, we know freedom is repressed in too many places around the world, particularly where terrorism and extremism continue to pose grave threats. Americans have always held boldly and unapologetically to the truth that liberty is an inherent human right, and we reaffirm our commitment to keeping the light of freedom burning bright and shining out to the entire world.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we pay tribute to the brave individuals who, despite all risks, have challenged injustice and fought for freedom, especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We stand in solidarity with those who still live under tyrannical governments and emphasize that the world will be better off when all governments respect the right of all people to live in freedom.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2018, as World Freedom Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>The United States expects the arrival at the border between the United States and Mexico (southern border) of a substantial number of aliens primarily from Central America who appear to have no lawful basis for admission into our country. They are traveling in large, organized groups through <PRTPAGE P="285"/>Mexico and reportedly intend to enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and to seek asylum, despite the fact that, based on past experience, a significant majority will not be eligible for or be granted that benefit. Many entered Mexico unlawfully—some with violence—and have rejected opportunities to apply for asylum and benefits in Mexico. The arrival of large numbers of aliens will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands of aliens into the interior of the United States. The continuing and threatened mass migration of aliens with no basis for admission into the United States through our southern border has precipitated a crisis and undermines the integrity of our borders. I therefore must take immediate action to protect the national interest, and to maintain the effectiveness of the asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers who demonstrate that they have fled persecution and warrant the many special benefits associated with asylum.</FP>
  <FP>In recent weeks, an average of approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens have entered each day at our southern border. In Fiscal Year 2018 overall, 124,511 aliens were found inadmissible at ports of entry on the southern border, while 396,579 aliens were apprehended entering the United States unlawfully between such ports of entry. The great number of aliens who cross unlawfully into the United States through the southern border consumes tremendous resources as the Government seeks to surveil, apprehend, screen, process, and detain them.</FP>
  <FP>Aliens who enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and are subject to expedited removal may avoid being promptly removed by demonstrating, during an initial screening process, a credible fear of persecution or torture. Approximately 2 decades ago, most aliens deemed inadmissible at a port of entry or apprehended after unlawfully entering the United States through the southern border were single adults who were promptly returned to Mexico, and very few asserted a fear of return. Since then, however, there has been a massive increase in fear-of-persecution or torture claims by aliens who enter the United States through the southern border. The vast majority of such aliens are found to satisfy the credible-fear threshold, although only a fraction of the claimants whose claims are adjudicated ultimately qualify for asylum or other protection. Aliens found to have a credible fear are often released into the interior of the United States, as a result of a lack of detention space and a variety of other legal and practical difficulties, pending adjudication of their claims in a full removal proceeding in immigration court. The immigration adjudication process often takes years to complete because of the growing volume of claims and because of the need to expedite proceedings for detained aliens. During that time, many released aliens fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with subsequent orders of removal, or are difficult to locate and remove.</FP>

  <FP>Members of family units pose particular challenges. The Federal Government lacks sufficient facilities to house families together. Virtually all members of family units who enter the United States through the southern border, unlawfully or without proper documentation, and that are found to have a credible fear of persecution, are thus released into the United States. Against this backdrop of near-assurance of release, the number of such aliens traveling as family units who enter through the southern border and <PRTPAGE P="286"/>claim a credible fear of persecution has greatly increased. And large numbers of family units decide to make the dangerous and unlawful border crossing with their children.</FP>
  <FP>The United States has a long and proud history of offering protection to aliens who are fleeing persecution and torture and who qualify under the standards articulated in our immigration laws, including through our asylum system and the Refugee Admissions Program. But our system is being overwhelmed by migration through our southern border. Crossing the border to avoid detection and then, if apprehended, claiming a fear of persecution is in too many instances an avenue to near-automatic release into the interior of the United States. Once released, such aliens are very difficult to remove. An additional influx of large groups of aliens arriving at once through the southern border would add tremendous strain to an already taxed system, especially if they avoid orderly processing by unlawfully crossing the southern border.</FP>
  <FP>The entry of large numbers of aliens into the United States unlawfully between ports of entry on the southern border is contrary to the national interest, and our law has long recognized that aliens who seek to lawfully enter the United States must do so at ports of entry. Unlawful entry puts lives of both law enforcement and aliens at risk. By contrast, entry at ports of entry at the southern border allows for orderly processing, which enables the efficient deployment of law enforcement resources across our vast southern border.</FP>
  <FP>Failing to take immediate action to stem the mass migration the United States is currently experiencing and anticipating would only encourage additional mass unlawful migration and further overwhelming of the system.</FP>

  <FP>Other presidents have taken strong action to prevent mass migration. In Proclamation 4865 of September 29, 1981 (High Seas Interdiction of Illegal Aliens), in response to an influx of Haitian nationals traveling to the United States by sea, President Reagan suspended the entry of undocumented aliens from the high seas and ordered the Coast Guard to intercept such aliens before they reached United States shores and to return them to their point of origin. In Executive Order 12807 of May 24, 1992 (Interdiction of Illegal Aliens), in response to a dramatic increase in the unlawful mass migration of Haitian nationals to the United States, President Bush ordered additional measures to interdict such Haitian nationals and return them to their home country. The Supreme Court upheld the legality of those measures in <E T="03">Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc.,</E> 509 U.S. 155 (1993).</FP>

  <FP>I am similarly acting to suspend, for a limited period, the entry of certain aliens in order to address the problem of large numbers of aliens traveling through Mexico to enter our country unlawfully or without proper documentation. I am tailoring the suspension to channel these aliens to ports of entry, so that, if they enter the United States, they do so in an orderly and controlled manner instead of unlawfully. Under this suspension, aliens entering through the southern border, even those without proper documentation, may, consistent with this proclamation, avail themselves of our asylum system, provided that they properly present themselves for inspection at a port of entry. In anticipation of a large group of aliens arriving in the coming weeks, I am directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to commit additional resources to support our ports of entry at the southern <PRTPAGE P="287"/>border to assist in processing those aliens—and all others arriving at our ports of entry—as efficiently as possible.</FP>
  <FP>But aliens who enter the United States unlawfully through the southern border in contravention of this proclamation will be ineligible to be granted asylum under the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that became effective earlier today. Those aliens may, however, still seek other forms of protection from persecution or torture. In addition, this limited suspension will facilitate ongoing negotiations with Mexico and other countries regarding appropriate cooperative arrangements to prevent unlawful mass migration to the United States through the southern border. Thus, this proclamation is also necessary to manage and conduct the foreign affairs of the United States effectively.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), respectively) hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.

  </P>
  <P>(d) No later than 90 days after the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall jointly submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, a recommendation on whether an extension or renewal of the suspension or limitation on entry in section 1 of this proclamation is in the interests of the United States.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Interdiction.</E> The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Government of Mexico regarding appropriate steps—consistent with applicable law and the foreign policy, national security, and public-safety interests of the United States—to address the approach of large groups of aliens traveling through Mexico with the intent of entering the United States unlawfully, including efforts to deter, dissuade, and return such aliens before they physically enter United States territory through the southern border.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During American Education Week, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that all Americans have access to an affordable, high-quality education. We also recognize the hard work of our Nation's dedicated parents, guardians, teachers, and school leaders to ensure that every child is prepared to join today's growing workforce. To maintain our country's competitiveness, our students deserve a good education that empowers them with the knowledge, skills, and character necessary to reach their full potential.</FP>
  <FP>Education is a lifelong process of learning and discovery that begins at home. Parents are a child's first teacher. By actively engaging with educators, mentors, coaches, faith leaders, and community members, parents are best equipped to shape their child's education. My Administration has worked to empower States and local communities with greater control and flexibility over their schools. We are also protecting and expanding parents' access to a wide range of high-quality educational choices, including effective public, charter, magnet, private, parochial, online, and homeschool options.</FP>
  <FP>Each student is unique, with their own distinct experiences, needs, learning styles, and dreams. Thus, education must be customized and individualized as there is no single approach to education that works for every student. My Administration encourages parents, guardians, educators, and school leaders to rethink the way students learn in America to ensure that every American receives a high-quality education that meets their needs. We empower teachers to create learning environments that are challenging, relevant, and engaging. When families are free to choose where and how their children learn, and when teachers are free to do their best work, students are able to grow and explore their talents and passions.</FP>

  <FP>High-quality education also paves the way for a thriving workforce in America. My Administration acknowledges that our economy requires dynamic approaches to education and workforce development. Today's students will enter an economy that is stronger than ever before. With consumer confidence at a record high and unemployment at the lowest rate in almost 50 years, bringing our workforce development efforts into the 21st century is exceedingly critical. In July, I established the President's National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board to harness the expertise of the education and business communities, and to allow private- and public-sector collaboration to resolve pressing issues related to workforce development. Additionally, I was pleased to sign a reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. This legislation increases access to programs that will help provide students with the skills they need to succeed in our 21st century economy while enabling more flexibility for States to meet the unique needs of their students, educators, and employers. My Administration is committed to ensuring that America's students and workers have access to education and job training that will equip them to compete and win in the global economy.<PRTPAGE P="290"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>This week, we are reminded of our great responsibility to empower our Nation's students to develop the skills needed to pursue meaningful careers. We must continue our efforts to expand freedom and opportunity in education, with the knowledge that our country's future relies on today's students.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 11 through November 17, 2018, as American Education Week.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Under my Administration's policies, our Nation's economy is booming and Americans have more opportunities than ever before. Men and women from all walks of life are moving off the sidelines and into the workforce. In this economic context, our country needs workers with world-class skills and abilities to fill vacant positions in the labor force. During National Apprenticeship Week, we recognize the importance of apprenticeships in helping our country's hardworking people develop the competencies that enable success in today's dynamic, 21st century economy.</FP>
  <FP>As a lifelong businessman who has hired thousands of workers, I am a strong believer in the apprenticeship model, and my Administration is committed to expanding apprenticeship opportunities. Apprenticeship programs, when implemented effectively, provide workers with an opportunity to “earn and learn” on the job, and pair workplace education with classroom instruction, accelerating the learning process for participants and increasing their marketability. Since I took office, American employers have hired over 400,000 apprentices. In 2018 alone, we committed $145 million to diversify and scale apprenticeship programs, and we provided an additional $150 million in grant opportunities to promote apprenticeships in industries where they have not traditionally existed, including advanced manufacturing, banking and finance, information technology, and healthcare. In addition, as a result of our Pledge to America's Workers, in just 3 months, we have secured commitments from more than 160 companies and associations to provide jobs, education, and workforce development opportunities to 6.4 million American workers.</FP>

  <FP>In June of last year, I signed an Executive Order creating the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, which focused on identifying proposals to <PRTPAGE P="291"/>cultivate apprenticeships across all sectors of the economy and reform ineffective education and workforce development programs. The Task Force was composed of representatives from business, the trades, labor and industry groups, and educational institutions; each participant contributed a unique set of insights and experiences. The Task Force helped my Administration map out a strategy for creating new, industry-recognized apprenticeship programs that will encourage employers and industries to adopt the apprenticeship model.</FP>
  <FP>In addition to supporting apprenticeships, I am advancing tax and regulatory policies that are increasing opportunities for all Americans. Last month, the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7 percent, its lowest point in nearly 50 years, and more Americans are working today than ever before in our history. At the same time, right now, there are 7 million unfilled jobs in our country. By successfully deploying the apprenticeship model, the United States can build a workforce strong enough to quickly fill all of those jobs and better compete on the global stage. This week, I encourage all participants in our economy, from business leaders to government officials to educators, to join in our efforts to expand apprenticeship programs. Together, we can build and educate our Nation's workforce, securing American economic greatness for future generations.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 12 through November 18, 2018, as National Apprenticeship Week.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Veterans Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On November 11, 1918, the United States and its allies signed an armistice with Germany to end hostilities in World War I. The Great War exacted a tremendous toll on our Nation. More than 100,000 American service members perished in the war, and the lives of countless others were forever altered. In 1919, to honor and memorialize these sacrifices, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed November 11 as Armistice Day, the precursor to Veterans Day, expressing “solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service.” This year, as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, we again salute the generations upon generations of American heroes who have sacrificed so much to secure the blessings of freedom for their fellow Americans.</FP>

  <FP>We will never be able to repay the debt we owe the brave men and women who have served in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard. <PRTPAGE P="292"/>To the 20 million veterans alive today: this Veterans Day, we recommit ourselves to providing you with the care you deserve. In June, I signed into law the VA MISSION Act of 2018, enacting some of the most substantial reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a generation. This landmark legislation made Veterans Choice permanent, ensuring that our Nation's veterans have timely access to the highest quality of care possible and the flexibility to receive care either at the VA or at a private healthcare facility. The VA MISSION Act is removing barriers to telemedicine and expanding access to walk-in clinics. And it is giving veterans who were catastrophically injured in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Gulf War the same access to caregiver assistance that veterans of more recent conflicts already enjoy. My Administration is also processing veteran claims and appeals more quickly than ever before, and veterans can now use their GI Bill benefits at any point in their lives. And, for the first time in history, the Department of Defense and the VA will share electronic health records, improving accessibility and easing the healthcare burden on our veterans.</FP>
  <FP>For many service members, the transition into civilian life can be fraught with challenges. To enhance their access to critical resources and support, I signed an Executive Order that directs the Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security to develop and implement a Joint Action Plan that provides seamless access to mental health treatment and suicide prevention resources for service members in the year following the conclusion of their military service.</FP>
  <FP>As we mark the centennial of the Armistice, we remember the countless sacrifices that our country's heroic veterans have made throughout our history to preserve our liberty and prosperity. Our veterans embody the values and ideals of America and the timeless virtue of serving a greater cause. With respect for, and in recognition of, the contributions our service members have made to the advance of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's veterans. As Commander in Chief of our heroic Armed Forces, I humbly thank our veterans and their families for their selflessness and love of country as we remember their service and their sacrifice. Today, and every day, we pay tribute to those who have worn the uniform, and we pray for the safety of all currently serving in harm's way.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2018, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the fortitude and sacrifice of our veterans through public ceremonies and private thoughts and prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative expressions and programs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Family Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Family Week, we celebrate the immeasurable contributions, influence, and virtues of one of the greatest institutions—the family. Whether related by biology, marriage, or adoption, the family is a primary source of unconditional love and steadfast support. Strong families multiply joy, share challenges, and provide firm foundations for each member's growth and success in life. Families are central to learning values, and they enrich our neighborhoods, communities, and Nation.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is focused on creating an environment in which families can thrive. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has produced larger paychecks for workers, who are now keeping more of their hard-earned income. Due to this historic legislation and the elimination of unnecessary and burdensome regulations, the unemployment rate dropped to its lowest point in nearly 50 years last month, and more Americans are working today than ever before in our history. We have fought for and implemented more family-friendly policies like doubling the child tax credit and making it available to low-income working families; creating the dependent tax credit for taxpayers with children over the age of 16 and non-child dependents; and establishing an employer tax credit for paid family and medical leave. I also created, by Executive Order, the first ever National Council for the American Worker, to enhance Americans' access to the skills and support necessary to secure and retain a good paying job. In both of my budgets, I have also requested congressional funding for a national paid family leave program. All of these reforms are giving much-needed financial relief to hardworking parents. When Americans have greater opportunities to work and provide for their families, our Nation is stronger and more prosperous.</FP>
  <FP>Every family, regardless of its social status or background, faces its own challenges. Tragically, many American family members are in the midst of a heart-wrenching and difficult battle against drug addiction. For this reason, I have tasked my Administration with strengthening our public health and safety response to the arising crisis of opioid and other drug addiction. In February, I secured $6 billion in new funding for combating the opioid epidemic. In March, I released my Administration's plan to address the epidemic by reducing drug demand, cutting off the flow of illicit drugs, expanding access to overdose prevention and evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, and conducting research to improve prevention and treatment. And, last month, I signed the historic SUPPORT Act, which will reduce the length of time children spend in foster care due to a parent who is struggling with a substance use disorder. We will continue to remain firm in our commitment to provide help to families devastated by opioid addiction.</FP>

  <FP>This week, we recognize in a special way that American families are integral to building and sustaining our great Nation, and we thank God for this precious gift. We must encourage and support the success of our families so that they can create loving and nurturing homes for all our children.<PRTPAGE P="294"/>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Thanksgiving Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Thanksgiving Day, we recall the courageous and inspiring journey of the Pilgrims who, nearly four centuries ago, ventured across the vast ocean to flee religious persecution and establish a home in the New World. They faced illness, harsh conditions, and uncertainty, as they trusted in God for a brighter future. The more than 100 Pilgrims who arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the Mayflower, instilled in our Nation a strong faith in God that continues to be a beacon of hope to all Americans. Thanksgiving Day is a time to pause and to reflect, with family and friends, on our heritage and the sacrifices of our forebearers who secured the blessings of liberty for an independent, free, and united country.</FP>
  <FP>After surviving a frigid winter and achieving their first successful harvest in 1621, the Pilgrims set aside 3 days to feast and give thanks for God's abundant mercy and blessings. Members of the Wampanoag tribe—who had taught the Pilgrims how to farm in New England and helped them adjust and thrive in that new land—shared in the bounty and celebration. In recognition of that historic event, President George Washington, in 1789, issued a proclamation declaring the first national day of thanksgiving. He called upon the people of the United States to unite in rendering unto God our sincere and humble gratitude “for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country” and “the favorable interpositions of his Providence.” President Abraham Lincoln revived this tradition as our fractured Nation endured the horrors of the Civil War. Ever since, we have set aside this day to give special thanks to God for the many blessings, gifts, and love he has bestowed on us and our country.</FP>

  <FP>This Thanksgiving, as we gather in places of worship and around tables surrounded by loved ones, in humble gratitude for the bountiful gifts we have received, let us keep in close memory our fellow Americans who have faced hardship and tragedy this year. In the spirit of generosity and compassion, let us joyfully reach out in word and deed, and share our time and resources throughout our communities. Let us also find ways to give to the <PRTPAGE P="295"/>less fortunate—whether it be in the form of sharing a hearty meal, extending a helping hand, or providing words of encouragement.</FP>
  <FP>We are especially reminded on Thanksgiving of how the virtue of gratitude enables us to recognize, even in adverse situations, the love of God in every person, every creature, and throughout nature. Let us be mindful of the reasons we are grateful for our lives, for those around us, and for our communities. We also commit to treating all with charity and mutual respect, spreading the spirit of Thanksgiving throughout our country and across the world.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we particularly acknowledge the sacrifices of our service members, law enforcement personnel, and first responders who selflessly serve and protect our Nation. This Thanksgiving, more than 200,000 brave American patriots will spend the holiday overseas, away from their loved ones. Because of the men and women in uniform who volunteer to defend our liberty, we are able to enjoy the splendor of the American life. We pray for their safety, and for the families who await their return.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 22, 2018, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all Americans to gather, in homes and places of worship, to offer a prayer of thanks to God for our many blessings.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>During National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we recommit ourselves to the fight against impaired driving. Every day, lives are needlessly lost and irreparably altered by collisions involving drugs or alcohol. These horrible tragedies are avoidable, and each of us must make responsible decisions to prevent them and keep our communities safe.</FP>
  <FP>Operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, illicit drugs, or certain medications can have devastating consequences. In 2017, more than 10,000 people died in alcohol-related crashes in the United States, accounting for 29 percent of all traffic fatalities. Drunk or drugged drivers experience diminished judgment and decreased motor coordination and reaction time, putting at grave risk passengers, pedestrians, and other drivers.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is committed to raising public awareness about the dangers of impaired driving, and to supporting innovative ways of reducing related fatalities. This month in particular, we recognize the public safety <PRTPAGE P="296"/>professionals and law enforcement officers who work to protect our communities by removing dangerously impaired drivers from the road. We also express our great appreciation for the emergency responders across America who save lives through rescue operations on our roads on a daily basis. We continue our efforts to eliminate outdated regulations that unnecessarily hamper the ability of American companies to help reduce instances of impaired driving through innovations such as ride hailing services and Advanced Vehicle Technology. Additionally, we are providing treatment for those suffering from alcohol and substance abuse, improving data collection and toxicology practices, and ensuring that our law enforcement professionals receive vital resources to help prevent impaired driving and to respond to the tragedies it causes.</FP>
  <FP>Every American can take a few simple steps to make our roads safer. We hope every driver commits to making responsible and safe decisions when driving, including driving sober, finding a designated driver, and keeping loved ones from getting behind the wheel while impaired. By educating our communities on the importance of driving sober, we can help avoid loss of life, debilitating injuries, and unbearable heartache. We must act to protect our loved ones and eliminate fatalities that prevent our fellow Americans from enjoying full and happy lives.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2018 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">World AIDS Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>For more than three decades, our Nation and the world have confronted the challenges posed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Today, thanks to lifesaving medications, an HIV/AIDS diagnosis does not have to be a death sentence. On World AIDS Day, we remember the 35 million lives that have sadly been cut short by this terrible disease, and we renew our pledge to stand with those living with it until it is eliminated from our communities.</FP>

  <FP>Medical advancements and procedures have transformed HIV from a disease that meant nearly certain death into a generally manageable, chronic condition. Antiretroviral drugs and therapies help control the virus so that people with HIV can experience healthy and productive lives with reduced <PRTPAGE P="297"/>risk of transmitting it to others. With these long-sought solutions now at our disposal, we have the ability to help alleviate the pain and needless suffering of our fellow Americans living with HIV, their family and friends, and the millions of others around the world living with this disease.</FP>
  <FP>Our efforts to connect those affected by this disease with high-quality healthcare are dramatically improving many lives. The 2017 National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) progress report indicates a significant increase of Americans living with HIV. These people are now able to suppress the virus with medication. But we cannot rest on this progress. In recent years, opioids and other injected drugs have caused HIV outbreaks in communities rarely affected before the outbreak of the epidemic. We must continue to work to eliminate the stigma that surrounds HIV so that no one is afraid to learn their HIV status, treat their condition if HIV infected, and prevent infection if they are at risk.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration remains steadfastly focused on achieving the NHAS goals for 2020. These goals are within our reach, but achieving them will require continued coordinated work with local and State governments, faith-based and charitable organizations, and many others. One such critical component of our domestic public health response is the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. Working with cities, counties, States, and local community-based programs, this program provides a comprehensive system of HIV care, lifesaving medications, and essential support services to more than half a million low-income people in the United States each year.</FP>
  <FP>We also remain committed to collaborating with both national and international stakeholders through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). For 15 years, PEPFAR has devoted American resources to critical HIV prevention, treatment, and care to some of the world's most vulnerable populations, helping to save more than 17 million lives. PEPFAR has continued to support a rapid acceleration of HIV prevention by using data to increase program performance, mobilize domestic resources, and support local partners for sustainable implementation. Through this program, we are supporting lifesaving HIV treatment for more than 14 million people and have enabled more than 2 million babies of HIV-infected mothers to be born HIV-free.</FP>
  <FP>With American leadership, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has shifted from crisis toward control. Hope and life are prospering where death and despair once prevailed. A generation that could have been lost is instead thriving and building a brighter future. For the first time in modern history, we have the ability to sustainably control an epidemic, despite the absence of a vaccine or cure, and create a future of flourishing, stable communities in the United States and around the globe.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2018, as World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and American people to join me in appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support and compassion to those living with HIV.<PRTPAGE P="298"/>

  <FP>
    <E T="04">TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>It is my sorrowful duty to announce officially the death of George Herbert Walker Bush, the forty-first President of the United States, on November 30, 2018.</FP>
  <FP>President Bush led a great American life, one that combined and personified two of our Nation's greatest virtues: an entrepreneurial spirit and a commitment to public service. Our country will greatly miss his inspiring example.</FP>
  <FP>On the day he turned 18, 6 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, George H.W. Bush volunteered for combat duty in the Second World War. The youngest aviator in United States naval history at the time, he flew 58 combat missions, including one in which, after taking enemy fire, he parachuted from his burning plane into the Pacific Ocean. After the war, he returned home and started a business. In his words, “the big thing” he learned from this endeavor was “the satisfaction of creating jobs.”</FP>
  <FP>The same unselfish spirit that motivated his business pursuits later inspired him to resume the public service he began as a young man. First, as a member of Congress, then as Ambassador to the United Nations, Chief of the United States Liaison Office in China, Director of Central Intelligence, Vice President, and finally President of the United States, George H.W. Bush guided our Nation through the Cold War, to its peaceful and victorious end, and into the decades of prosperity that have followed. Through sound judgment, practical wisdom, and steady leadership, President Bush made safer the second half of a tumultuous and dangerous century.</FP>
  <FP>Even with all he accomplished in service to our Nation, President Bush remained humble. He never believed that government—even when under his own leadership—could be the source of our Nation's strength or its greatness. America, he rightly told us, is illuminated by “a thousand points of light,” “ethnic, religious, social, business, labor union, neighborhood, regional and other organizations, all of them varied, voluntary and unique” in which Americans serve Americans to build and maintain the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth. President Bush recognized that these communities of people are the true source of America's strength and vitality.</FP>

  <FP>It is with great sadness that we mark the passing of one of America's greatest points of light, the death of President George H.W. Bush.<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

Bush, and as an expression of public sorrow, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions for a period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that, for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.</FP>
  <FP>I hereby order that suitable honors be rendered by units of the Armed Forces under orders of the Secretary of Defense.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Today, we honor those who perished 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor, and we salute every veteran who served in World War II over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack.</FP>
  <FP>On December 7, 1941, America was attacked without warning at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, by the air and naval forces of Imperial Japan. Just before 8:00 a.m., Japanese aircraft ripped through the sky, dropping bombs on ships of the United States Pacific Fleet and on nearby airfields and bases. The attack took the lives of more than 2,400 American service members and wounded another 1,100 American citizens. The brutal surprise attack halted only after nearly two hours of chaos, death, and destruction.</FP>

  <FP>Despite the shock and confusion of the moment, American service members and first responders on the island of Oahu mounted an incredibly brave defense against insurmountable odds. American pilots took to the air to engage enemy aircraft, sailors took their battle stations, and medical personnel cared for the wounded. Many witnesses to the events of that day <PRTPAGE P="300"/>perished in the attacks, leaving countless acts of valor unrecorded. Nevertheless, 15 Medals of Honor were awarded—10 of them posthumously—to United States Navy personnel for acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty.</FP>
  <FP>Although the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was badly impaired, America did not falter. One day after the attacks, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared to the Congress: “No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.” And, in the weeks, months, and years that followed the brutal attack at Pearl Harbor, Americans united with a steadfast resolve to defend the freedoms upon which our great Nation was founded. Millions of brave men and women answered their country's call to service with unquestionable courage. These incredible patriots fought, bled, sacrificed, and ultimately triumphed for the cause of freedom.</FP>
  <FP>We are blessed as a Nation to have as examples the incredible heroes of World War II, who fought so valiantly to preserve all that we hold dear. Earlier this year, I had the tremendous honor of meeting Mr. Ray Chavez, who was the oldest living Pearl Harbor veteran. Ray passed away only a few weeks ago at the incredible age of 106. But his legacy is forever etched into our country's rich history, along with the legacies of all our brave veterans. They tell of the mettle of the American spirit under fire and of the will of our people to stand up to any threat. The selfless bravery and dedication of these extraordinary Americans will never be forgotten.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we remember all those killed on the island of Oahu on that fateful Sunday morning in 1941, and we honor the American patriots of the Greatest Generation who laid down their lives in the battles of World War II. America is forever blessed to have strong men and women with exceptional courage who are willing and able to step forward to defend our homeland and our liberty.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as “National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2018, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our Nation was founded on the idea that our Creator endows each individual with certain unalienable rights. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson identified life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as among these fundamental human rights. Our Nation has enshrined these and other rights, which Americans continue to enjoy today, in the Bill of Rights.</FP>
  <FP>On Bill of Rights Day, we recognize the key role of the Bill of Rights in protecting our individual liberties and limiting the power of government. The Founding Fathers understood the real threat government can pose to the rights of the people. James Madison, who introduced the Bill of Rights in the Congress, stated that the “essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be, in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.” That is why those first 10 Amendments to the Constitution, among others, protected the right to speak freely, the right to freely worship, the right to keep and bear arms, the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to due process of law. As a part of the Constitution, the supreme law of the land, the Bill of Rights has protected our rights effectively against the abuse of government power for 227 years.</FP>
  <FP>The Bill of Rights has served as a model for other countries in helping them develop their own safeguards for fundamental human rights. Seventy years ago, on December 10, 1948, as the world was emerging from the catastrophic destruction of World War II, the Bill of Rights inspired the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Similar to the Bill of Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights enumerates many basic rights that are essential to preserving the dignity and liberty of all people. Today, the United States continues to respect the sovereign right of each country to chart its own social, economic, and cultural advancement. We also, however, recognize the universal truth that those countries that strive to honor and defend human rights are more likely to achieve long-term, sustainable prosperity and peace.</FP>
  <FP>During Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we vow to fiercely protect the eternal flame of liberty. Since there will always be a temptation for government to abuse its power, we reaffirm our commitment to defend the Bill of Rights and uphold the Constitution. We also remember all those around the world whose God-given rights have been violated and disregarded by authoritarian regimes, and we express our desire for the rule of law and liberty to one day triumph over all forms of oppression.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Wright Brothers Day, 2018By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On December 17, 1903, two American brothers from Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, launched the first manned, powered flight on a windy beach in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Their handcrafted biplane, though aloft a mere 12 seconds, ushered in the age of aviation and changed the course of history. On Wright Brothers Day, we commemorate this monumental achievement and look ahead to new chapters of American aviation in which new scientists, inventors, dreamers, and entrepreneurs will change history, fulfilling the human spirit's relentless quest for exploration and discovery.</FP>
  <FP>In the 115 years since the Wright brothers achieved their groundbreaking flight, the United States has led the world in aviation innovation. We have developed supersonic jets, walked on the moon, placed increasingly advanced landers and rovers on Mars, and vaulted spacecraft into the far reaches of the universe to explore distant horizons. The aviation industry has transformed the way we live and communicate, strengthening our connections to other nations and continents, expanding the global marketplace, and extending the frontiers of imagination and experimentation. These revolutionary achievements trace their origins back to the triumphs of Orville and Wilbur, two daring pioneers who, fueled by passion, undeterred by years of failure, and empowered by legendary American intrepidity, took mankind to new heights.</FP>
  <FP>We reflect with pride on the historic successes of our Nation's aviation visionaries, and we look ahead to a future of limitless potential and even greater accomplishment. My Administration is working to build on America's heritage as aviation pioneers and the world's greatest space-faring nation. I have instructed Federal agencies to embrace aeronautics and space industries of the future by modernizing our outdated regulations and funding aerospace research and development. We will broaden America's leadership in aerospace technology, including through the return of civil supersonic flight, the growth of commercial unmanned aircraft systems, and continued innovation in space exploration and travel. As we continue our pursuits in flight, we are indebted to the Wright brothers for hazarding to dream and inspiring our Nation to look heavenward.</FP>

  <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year <PRTPAGE P="303"/>as “Wright Brothers Day” and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2018, as Wright Brothers Day.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.DONALD J. TRUMP</FP>
  <PROC>Proclamation 9834 of December 21, 2018</PROC>
  <EAR>Proc. 9834</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act and for Other PurposesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. In Proclamation 8468 of December 23, 2009, the President designated the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (Mauritania) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 251).</FP>
  <FP>2. Section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) authorizes the President to terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if he determines that the country is not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act.</FP>
  <FP>3. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act, I have determined that Mauritania is not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act. Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designation of Mauritania as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act, effective January 1, 2019.</FP>
  <FP>4. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (the “USIFTA”), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the “USIFTA Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2112 note).</FP>

  <FP>5. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing <PRTPAGE P="304"/>duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.</FP>
  <FP>6. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the “2004 Agreement”).</FP>
  <FP>7. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 Agreement, President Bush determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.</FP>
  <FP>8. Each year from 2008 through 2017, the United States and Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.</FP>
  <FP>9. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008; Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009; Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010; Proclamation 8770 of December 29, 2011; Proclamation 8921 of December 20, 2012; Proclamation 9072 of December 23, 2013; Proclamation 9223 of December 23, 2014; Proclamation 9383 of December 21, 2015; Proclamation 9555 of December 15, 2016; and Proclamation 9687 of December 22, 2017, modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTS”) to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period.</FP>
  <FP>10. On November 8, 2018, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2019, and to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.</FP>
  <FP>11. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of December 31, 2019, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, as provided in Annex I of this proclamation.</FP>
  <FP>12. Section 915(b) of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (the “TFTEA”) (19 U.S.C. 4454(b)) authorizes the President to provide preferential treatment for eligible articles imported directly from Nepal into the customs territory of the United States.</FP>

  <FP>13. In Proclamation 9555 of December 15, 2016, the President determined, taking into account the factors specified in section 915(b)(1)(B) of the TFTEA, that Nepal met the eligibility requirements of that section. Accordingly, and after receiving advice from the United States International Trade Commission (the “Commission”) in accordance with section 503(e) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), the President determined to designate certain articles as eligible for duty-free treatment when imported from Nepal pursuant to section 915(c)(2)(A)(iv) of the TFTEA.<PRTPAGE P="305"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>14. Pursuant to section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that it is appropriate to update the list of programs under which special tariff treatment may be provided, and the programs' corresponding symbols, found in general note 3(c)(i) of the HTS in order to reflect more clearly the tariff preference for certain products of Nepal and the symbol of that program.</FP>
  <FP>15. Proclamation 8894 of October 29, 2012, implemented the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (the “PATPA”) with respect to the United States. Section 201(a) of the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the “PATPA Act”) (Public Law 112-43, 125 Stat. 497, 501), authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Article 3.28 of the PATPA, among other portions of that agreement.</FP>
  <FP>16. Sections 500, 514, and 625 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1500, 1514, and 1625) grant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) authority to determine the tariff classification of articles that have entered, or will enter, the commerce of the United States. In 2017, CBP changed the classification of certain guayabera-style shirts subject to Article 3.28 of the PATPA.</FP>
  <FP>17. In order to ensure the continuation of duty-free treatment for originating guayabera-style shirts subject to Article 3.28 of the PATPA, and in accordance with section 201 of the PATPA Act, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to modify the HTS to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.</FP>
  <FP>18. Proclamation 6821 of September 12, 1995, established a tariff-rate quota on certain tobacco and eliminated tariffs on certain other tobacco by adding additional U.S. note 5 and various subheadings to chapter 24 of the HTS. Additional U.S. note 5 to chapter 24 of the HTS provides that the tariff-rate quota applies to the aggregate quantity of tobacco entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, under enumerated HTS subheadings from specified countries or areas, except that the tariff-rate quota does not apply to smoking tobacco unless it is manufactured for use in cigarettes.</FP>
  <FP>19. Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, pursuant to the authority provided in section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the “1988 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)), modified the HTS to reflect amendments to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the “Convention”).</FP>
  <FP>20. HTS subheading 2403.11.00, covering water pipe tobacco that is not used in cigarettes, was incorrectly added to the subheadings enumerated in additional U.S. note 5 to chapter 24. I have determined, in accordance with section 604 of the Trade Act, that a modification to the HTS is needed to correct this technical error.</FP>

  <FP>21. In accordance with my direction, the United States Trade Representative announced in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E> notice of September 21, 2018, 83 <E T="03">FR</E> 47974 (the “USTR Notice”), his determination to modify the action <PRTPAGE P="306"/>taken in the Section 301 Action: China's Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation by imposing additional duties on products of China classified in the full and partial HTS subheadings set out in Annex A of that notice. The full and partial subheadings covered by the USTR Notice include HTS subheading 2009.89.60.</FP>
  <FP>22. Subsequently, Proclamation 9813 of October 30, 2018, divided HTS subheading 2009.89.60 into two new subheadings, 2009.89.65 and 2009.89.70, in order to provide that several countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more eligible articles for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences. In order to maintain the scope of the modification to the Section 301 action announced in the USTR Notice, and in accordance with section 604 of the Trade Act, I have determined that it is necessary to modify U.S. note 20(f) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS.</FP>
  <FP>23. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-239, 132 Stat. 2451), enacted on September 13, 2018, and effective October 13, 2018, created three headings in the HTS, 9902.01.15, 9902.01.16, and 9902.01.17, that refer to articles provided for in subheading 2009.89.60. As a result of the division of that subheading into two new subheadings in Proclamation 9813, those articles are now provided for in 2009.89.70. In accordance with section 604 of the Trade Act, I have determined that it is necessary to amend headings 9902.01.15, 9902.01.16, and 9902.01.17 of the HTS to reflect the correct new subheading.</FP>
  <FP>24. On June 30, 2007, the United States signed the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (the “KORUS”). The Congress approved the KORUS in section 101(a) of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “KORUS Act”) (Public Law 112-41, 125 Stat. 428).</FP>
  <FP>25. Proclamation 8783 of March 6, 2012, implemented the KORUS with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the KORUS Act, incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications necessary or appropriate to carry out the staged reductions in duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Articles 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 of the KORUS, and the schedule of duty reductions with respect to Korea set forth in Annex 2-B, Annex 4-B, and Annex 22-A of the KORUS.</FP>
  <FP>26. Section 201(b) of the KORUS Act (125 Stat. 433) authorizes the President, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 104 (125 Stat. 431-32), to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such modifications as the United States may agree to with Korea regarding the staging of any duty treatment set forth in Annex 2-B of the KORUS, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Korea provided for by the KORUS.</FP>

  <FP>27. The United States and Korea have agreed to modify the KORUS by modifying the staging of duty treatment for specific goods of Korea. I have determined that modification of the tariff treatment set forth in Proclamation 8783 is therefore necessary or appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Korea provided for by the KORUS, and to carry out the agreement with Korea modifying the staging of duty treatment for specific goods.<PRTPAGE P="307"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>28. On June 13, 2018, in accordance with section 104 of the KORUS Act, the United States Trade Representative submitted a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives that set forth the proposed modifications to the duties for specific goods of Korea under the KORUS. The consultation and layover period specified in section 104 expired on August 11, 2018.</FP>
  <FP>29. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005) if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>30. In Proclamation 9771 of July 30, 2018, pursuant to the authority provided in section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, the President modified the HTS to reflect a small number of amendments to the Convention.</FP>
  <FP>31. In order to ensure the continuation of staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods of Korea as provided in Proclamation 8783, under tariff categories that were modified in Proclamation 9771 to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate.</FP>
  <FP>32. Proclamation 7971 of December 22, 2005, implemented the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (the “USMFTA”) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 108-302, 118 Stat. 1103) (the “USMFTA Act”), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USMFTA.</FP>
  <FP>33. Section 203 of the USMFTA Act (118 Stat. 1109-15) provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of Morocco and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the USMFTA. Section 203(j)(2)(B)(i) of the USMFTA Act (118 Stat. 1115) authorizes the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set out in the USMFTA, and to proclaim modifications to such previously proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 104 of the USMFTA Act (118 Stat. 1106).</FP>
  <FP>34. The United States and Morocco have agreed to modify certain USMFTA rules of origin and to apply the modified rules to their bilateral trade. On November 21, 2017, in accordance with section 104 of USMFTA Act, the United States Trade Representative submitted a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives that set forth the proposed modifications to specific textile and apparel rules of origin of the USMFTA incorporated in the HTS. The consultation and layover period specified in section 104 expired on January 20, 2018.</FP>
  <FP>35. In order to reflect the agreement between the United States and Morocco related to USMFTA rules of origin, I have determined that it is necessary to modify the HTS.</FP>

  <FP>36. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, <PRTPAGE P="308"/>and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)); section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 2112 note); section 201(a) of the PATPA Act (125 Stat. 501); section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)); section 201(b) of the KORUS Act (125 Stat. 433); section 203(j) of the USMFTA Act (118 Stat. 1115); and section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), do proclaim that:</FP>

  <P>(12) In order to modify the staging of duty treatment for specific goods of Korea under the terms of general note 33 to the HTS:</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2019By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery. It is not enough merely to denounce this horrific assault on human dignity; we must actively work to prevent and end this barbaric exploitation of innocent victims. During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we pledge to continue the battle to abolish modern slavery and restore the lives of those affected by human trafficking.</FP>
  <FP>Human trafficking harms adults and children of all ages and demographics. Through force, fraud, and coercion, traffickers push their victims into demeaning forms of abuse, including domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. These crimes often remain hidden because victims are reluctant to seek help for a variety of reasons, including language barriers, fear of traffickers and law enforcement, and lack of trust. Human trafficking destroys precious lives and threatens our Nation's security, public health, and the rule of law. It is a scourge on the global community.</FP>
  <FP>We are morally obligated to confront and defeat the abhorrent practice of human trafficking, and I am keeping my pledge to take aggressive action. In February of 2017, I signed an Executive Order to dismantle transnational criminal organizations that traffic and exploit people. I have made it a top priority to fully secure our Nation's Southwest border, including through the continued construction of a physical wall, so that we can stop human trafficking and stem the flow of deadly drugs and criminals into our country. And my Administration is negotiating tough forced-labor provisions in our new trade agreements, including in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.</FP>
  <FP>In April of 2018, I was proud to sign into law the “Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017”, landmark legislation to fight online sex trafficking. This legislation makes it easier to take legal action against individuals who use websites to facilitate sex trafficking, helping victims seek justice against the websites that profit from their exploitation. It also clarifies that those who benefit from knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating an act of sex trafficking are in violation of Federal law.</FP>

  <FP>At my direction, Federal departments and agencies are ensuring full enforcement of our laws so that those who seek to exploit our people and break our laws receive the full measure of justice they deserve. In 2017 alone, the Department of Justice secured convictions against more than 500 defendants in human trafficking cases and the Federal Bureau of Investigation dismantled more than 42 criminal enterprises engaged in child sex trafficking. The Department of Homeland Security initiated more than 800 human trafficking cases, resulting in at least 1,500 arrests and 530 convictions. The Department of Health and Human Services modernized the National Human Trafficking Hotline. The Department of Transportation recently established an Advisory Committee on Human Trafficking to assist <PRTPAGE P="315"/>State and local transportation stakeholders in developing best practices for combating human trafficking. And my Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons is working tirelessly to prosecute traffickers and protect human trafficking victims. The task force has also enhanced collaboration with other nations, businesses, and survivors of human trafficking.</FP>
  <FP>Under my Administration, the Federal Government will continue to play a leading role in the fight against human trafficking. But all Americans can help in this effort by recognizing key indicators that can potentially save a life. Public awareness and education are critical, especially for those most likely to encounter perpetrators of enslavement and their victims, such as healthcare professionals, law enforcement officers, social services providers, and educators. Through the Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign, citizens can learn to identify victims, report suspected instances of trafficking, and bring those who exploit others to justice.</FP>
  <FP>As a Nation, we cherish and uphold the notion that all people are created with inherent dignity and entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Human trafficking and enslavement robs victims of these God-given endowments. Modern slavery in all its manifestations is a blight on humanity and an affront to our fundamental values. We will not rest until we eradicate this evil.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2019 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in the annual observation of National Freedom Day on February 1, 2019. I call upon industry associations, law enforcement, private businesses, faith-based and other organizations of civil society, schools, families, and all Americans to recognize our vital roles in ending all forms of modern slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities aimed at ending and preventing all forms of human trafficking.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.DONALD J. TRUMP</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Streamlining and Expediting Requests to Locate Broadband Facilities in Rural America</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote better access to broadband internet service in rural America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> Americans need access to reliable, affordable broadband internet service to succeed in today's information-driven, global economy. Currently, too many American citizens and businesses still lack access to this basic tool of modern economic connectivity. This problem is particularly acute in rural America, and it hinders the ability of rural American communities to increase economic prosperity; attract new businesses; enhance job growth; extend the reach of affordable, high-quality healthcare; enrich student learning with digital tools; and facilitate access to the digital marketplace.</FP>
  <FP>It shall therefore be the policy of the executive branch to use all viable tools to accelerate the deployment and adoption of affordable, reliable, modern high-speed broadband connectivity in rural America, including rural homes, farms, small businesses, manufacturing and production sites, tribal communities, transportation systems, and healthcare and education facilities.</FP>
  <FP>To implement this policy and enable sustainable rural broadband infrastructure projects, executive departments and agencies (agencies) should seek to reduce barriers to capital investment, remove obstacles to broadband services, and more efficiently employ Government resources.</FP>
  <FP>Among other actions, the executive branch will continue its implementation of section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-96) (“section 6409”), which requires, among other things, that the General Services Administration (GSA) develop a common form and master contract for wireless facility sitings on buildings and other property owned by the Federal Government. These documents enable the Federal Government to process wireless facility siting requests more efficiently and will also provide additional predictability regarding the availability of locations for asset installation to installers of wireless broadband facilities.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Reviewing Requests to Locate Broadband Facilities on Federal Real Property.</E> (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of General Services (Administrator), in coordination with the heads of Federal property managing agencies, shall evaluate the effectiveness of the GSA Common Form Application for use in streamlining and expediting the processing and review of requests to locate broadband facilities on Federal real property.</FP>

  <P>(b) As part of this evaluation, the Administrator shall determine whether any revisions to the GSA Common Form Application are appropriate and, to the extent consistent with law, shall begin implementation of any such revisions.<PRTPAGE P="319"/>
  </P>
  <P>(c) In furtherance of section 6409, all applicants and Federal property managing agencies shall use the GSA Common Form Application for wireless service antenna structure siting developed by the Administrator for requests to locate broadband facilities on Federal property. Federal property managing agencies shall expeditiously review and approve such requests unless an approval would negatively affect performance of the agency's mission or otherwise not be in the best interests of the United States.</P>
  <P>(d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, all Federal property managing agencies shall report to the GSA regarding their required use of the Common Form Application, the number of Common Form Applications received, the percentage approved, the percentage rejected, the basis for any rejection, and the number of working days each application was pending before being approved or rejected. Each report shall include the number of applications received, approved, and rejected within the preceding quarter.</P>
  <P>(e) Ninety days after the date of this order, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, the Administrator shall prepare and provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director) an aggregated summary report detailing results from the reports submitted under subsection (d) of this section. Not later than 1 year from the date of this order, the Administrator shall recommend to the Director improvements to the Common Form Application needed to further the purposes of this order.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this order:</FP>
  <P>(a) The term “Federal property managing agencies” means agencies that have custody and control of, or responsibility for managing, Federal lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted highways, and tribal lands.</P>
  <P>(b) The term “Federal real property” has the same meaning as that term has in Executive Order 13327 of February 4, 2004 (Federal Real Property Asset Management).</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Supporting Our Veterans During Their Transition From Uniformed Service to Civilian Life</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy</E>. It is the policy of the United States to support the health and well-being of uniformed service members and veterans. After serving our Nation, veterans deserve long, fulfilling civilian lives. Accordingly, our Government must improve mental healthcare and access to suicide prevention resources available to veterans, particularly during the critical 1-year period following the transition from uniformed service to civilian life. Most veterans' experience in uniform increases their resilience and broadens the skills they bring to the civilian workforce. Unfortunately, in some cases within the first year following transition, some veterans can have difficulties reintegrating into civilian life after their military experiences and some tragically take their own lives. Veterans, in their first year of separation from uniformed service, experience suicide rates approximately two times higher than the overall veteran suicide rate. To help prevent these tragedies, all veterans should have seamless access to high-quality mental healthcare and suicide prevention resources as they transition, with an emphasis on the 1-year period following separation.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Implementation</E>. (a) In furtherance of the policy described in section 1 of this order, I hereby direct the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to collaborate to address the complex challenges faced by our transitioning uniformed service members and veterans.</FP>
  <P>(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, a Joint Action Plan that describes concrete actions to provide, to the extent consistent with law, seamless access to mental health treatment and suicide prevention resources for transitioning uniformed service members in the year following discharge, separation, or retirement.</P>
  <P>(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, a status report on the implementation of the Joint Action Plan and how the proposed reforms have been effective in improving mental health treatment for all transitioning uniformed service members and veterans. The report shall include:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) preliminary progress of reforms implemented by the Joint Action Plan;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) any additional reforms that could help further address the problems that obstruct veterans' access to resources and continuous mental healthcare treatment, including any suggestions for legislative and regulatory reforms; and</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Protecting America Through Lawful Detention of Terrorists</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Findings.</E> (a) Consistent with long-standing law of war principles and applicable law, the United States may detain certain persons captured in connection with an armed conflict for the duration of the conflict.</FP>
  <P>(b) Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and other authorities authorized the United States to detain certain persons who were a part of or substantially supported al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. Today, the United States remains engaged in an armed conflict with al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, including with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.</P>
  <P>(c) The detention operations at the U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay are legal, safe, humane, and conducted consistent with United States and international law.</P>
  <P>(d) Those operations are continuing given that a number of the remaining individuals at the detention facility are being prosecuted in military commissions, while others must be detained to protect against continuing, significant threats to the security of the United States, as determined by periodic reviews.</P>
  <P>(e) Given that some of the current detainee population represent the most difficult and dangerous cases from among those historically detained at the facility, there is significant reason for concern regarding their reengagement in hostilities should they have the opportunity.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Status of Detention Facilities at U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay.</E> (a) Section 3 of Executive Order 13492 of January 22, 2009 (Review <PRTPAGE P="322"/>and Disposition of Individuals Detained at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities), ordering the closure of detention facilities at U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay, is hereby revoked.</FP>
  <P>(b) Detention operations at U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay shall continue to be conducted consistent with all applicable United States and international law, including the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.</P>
  <P>(c) In addition, the United States may transport additional detainees to U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay when lawful and necessary to protect the Nation.</P>
  <P>(d) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of any other appropriate executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Defense, recommend policies to the President regarding the disposition of individuals captured in connection with an armed conflict, including policies governing transfer of individuals to U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay.</P>
  <P>(e) Unless charged in or subject to a judgment of conviction by a military commission, any detainees transferred to U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay after the date of this order shall be subject to the procedures for periodic review established in Executive Order 13567 of March 7, 2011 (Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station Pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force), to determine whether continued law of war detention is necessary to protect against a significant threat to the security of the United States.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Rules of Construction.</E> (a) Nothing in this order shall prevent the Secretary of Defense from transferring any individual away from the U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay when appropriate, including to effectuate an order affecting the disposition of that individual issued by a court or competent tribunal of the United States having lawful jurisdiction.</FP>
  <P>(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful permanent residents of the United States, or any persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.</P>
  <P>(c) Nothing in this order shall prevent the Attorney General from, as appropriate, investigating, detaining, and prosecuting a terrorist subject to the criminal laws and jurisdiction of the United States.</P>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote the economic, academic, and social benefits of youth sports, fitness, and nutrition, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Revocation.</E> Executive Order 13545 of June 22, 2010, is hereby revoked.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Amendment.</E> Executive Order 13265 of June 6, 2002, is hereby amended as follows:</FP>
  <P>(a) The title is revised to read as follows: “President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.”</P>
  <P>(b) The preamble is revised to replace the phrase, “President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports” with “President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.”</P>

My Administration therefore aims to expand and encourage youth sports participation, and to promote the overall physical fitness, health, and nutrition of all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>Good health, including physical activity and proper nutrition, supports Americans', particularly children's, well-being, growth, and development. Participating in sports allows children to experience the connection between effort and success, and it enhances their academic, economic, and social prospects. Many of America's leaders attribute their lifetime achievements to lessons learned through sports participation and athletic activity. Additionally, youth sports help working parents and guardians by providing their children opportunities to engage in productive, positive activities outside of school. Unfortunately, during the past decade youth participation in team sports has declined. As of 2016, only 37 percent of children played team sports on a regular basis, down from 45 percent in 2008. Particularly troubling is that sports participation disproportionately lags among young girls and children who are from economically distressed areas.</FP>

This national strategy shall focus on children and youth in communities with below-average sports participation and communities with limited access to athletic facilities or recreational areas. Through this national strategy, the Secretary shall seek to:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) increase awareness of the benefits of participation in sports and regular physical activity, as well as the importance of good nutrition;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) promote private and public sector strategies to increase participation in sports, encourage regular physical activity, and improve nutrition;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) develop metrics that gauge youth sports participation and physical activity to inform efforts that will improve participation in sports and regular physical activity among young Americans; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) establish a national and local strategy to recruit volunteers who will encourage and support youth participation in sports and regular physical activity, through coaching, mentoring, teaching, or administering athletic and nutritional programs.</FP>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13826 of March 7, 2018</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13826</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Federal Interagency Council on Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to maximize the impact of Federal Government resources to keep our communities safe, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Federal Government must reduce crime, enhance public safety, and increase opportunity, thereby improving the lives of all Americans. In 2016, the violent crime rate in the United States increased by 3.4 percent, the largest single-year increase since 1991. Additionally, in 2016, there were more than 17,000 murders and nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States, a more than 20 percent increase in just 2 years. The Department of Justice, alongside State, local, and tribal law enforcement, has focused its efforts on the most violent criminals. Preliminary statistics indicate that, in the last year, the increase in the murder rate slowed and the violent crime rate decreased.</FP>
  <FP>To further improve public safety, we should aim not only to prevent crime in the first place, but also to provide those who have engaged in criminal activity with greater opportunities to lead productive lives. The Federal Government can assist in breaking this cycle of crime through a comprehensive strategy that addresses a range of issues, including mental health, vocational training, job creation, after-school programming, substance abuse, and mentoring. Incarceration is necessary to improve public safety, but its effectiveness can be enhanced through evidence-based rehabilitation programs. These efforts will lower recidivism rates, ease incarcerated individuals' reentry into the community, reduce future incarceration costs, and promote positive social and economic outcomes.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the United States to prioritize efforts to prevent youths and adults from entering or reentering the criminal justice system. While investigating crimes and prosecuting perpetrators must remain the top priority of law enforcement, crime reduction policy should also include efforts to prevent crime in the first place and to lower recidivism rates. These efforts should address a range of social and economic factors, including poverty, lack of education and employment opportunities, family dissolution, drug use and addiction, mental illness, and behavioral health conditions. The Federal Government must harness and wisely direct its considerable resources and broad expertise to identify and help implement improved crime prevention strategies, including evidence-based practices that reduce criminal activity among youths and adults. Through effective coordination among executive departments and agencies (agencies), the Federal Government can have a constructive role in preventing crime and in ensuring that the correctional facilities in the United States prepare inmates to successfully reenter communities as productive, law-abiding members of society.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Establishment of the Federal Interagency Council on Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry.</E> (a) There is hereby established the Federal Interagency Council on Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry (Council), <PRTPAGE P="792"/>co-chaired by the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Senior Advisor to the President in charge of the White House Office of American Innovation, or their respective designees.

  </P>
  <FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(v) facilitate research in the areas described in this subsection, including improved access to data for research and evaluation purposes.</FP>
  <P>(b) The Council shall develop and present to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy:</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote economic mobility, strong social networks, and accountability to American taxpayers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose</E>. The United States and its Constitution were founded on the principles of freedom and equal opportunity for all. To ensure that all Americans would be able to realize the benefits of those principles, especially during hard times, the Government established programs to help families with basic unmet needs. Unfortunately, many of the programs designed to help families have instead delayed economic independence, perpetuated poverty, and weakened family bonds. While bipartisan welfare reform enacted in 1996 was a step toward eliminating the economic stagnation and social harm that can result from long-term Government dependence, the welfare system still traps many recipients, especially children, in poverty and is in need of further reform and modernization in order to increase self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy</E>. (a) In 2017, the Federal Government spent more than $700 billion on low-income assistance. Since its inception, the welfare system has grown into a large bureaucracy that might be susceptible to measuring success by how many people are enrolled in a program rather than by how many have moved from poverty into financial independence. This is not the type of system that was envisioned when welfare programs were instituted in this country. The Federal Government's role is to clear paths to self-sufficiency, reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need. The Federal Government should do everything within its authority to empower individuals by providing opportunities for work, including by investing in Federal programs that are effective at moving people into the workforce and out of poverty. It must examine Federal policies and programs to ensure that they are consistent with principles that are central to the American spirit—work, free enterprise, and safeguarding human and economic resources. For those policies or programs that are not succeeding in those respects, it is our duty to either improve or eliminate them.</FP>
  <P>(b) It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to reform the welfare system of the United States so that it empowers people in a manner that is consistent with applicable law and the following principles, which shall be known as the Principles of Economic Mobility:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Improve employment outcomes and economic independence (including by strengthening existing work requirements for work-capable people and introducing new work requirements when legally permissible);</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) Promote strong social networks as a way of sustainably escaping poverty (including through work and marriage);<PRTPAGE P="797"/>
  </FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) Address the challenges of populations that may particularly struggle to find and maintain employment (including single parents, formerly incarcerated individuals, the homeless, substance abusers, individuals with disabilities, and disconnected youth);</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) Balance flexibility and accountability both to ensure that State, local, and tribal governments, and other institutions, may tailor their public assistance programs to the unique needs of their communities and to ensure that welfare services and administering agencies can be held accountable for achieving outcomes (including by designing and tracking measures that assess whether programs help people escape poverty);</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(v) Reduce the size of bureaucracy and streamline services to promote the effective use of resources;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(vi) Reserve benefits for people with low incomes and limited assets;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(vii) Reduce wasteful spending by consolidating or eliminating Federal programs that are duplicative or ineffective;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(viii) Create a system by which the Federal Government remains updated on State, local, and tribal successes and failures, and facilitates access to that information so that other States and localities can benefit from it; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ix) Empower the private sector, as well as local communities, to develop and apply locally based solutions to poverty.</FP>
  <P>(c) As part of our pledge to increase opportunities for those in need, the Federal Government must first enforce work requirements that are required by law. It must also strengthen requirements that promote obtaining and maintaining employment in order to move people to independence. To support this focus on employment, the Federal Government should:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) review current federally funded workforce development programs. If more than one executive department or agency (agency) administers programs that are similar in scope or population served, they should be consolidated, to the extent permitted by law, into the agency that is best equipped to fulfill the expectations of the programs, while ineffective programs should be eliminated; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) invest in effective workforce development programs and encourage, to the greatest extent possible, entities that have demonstrated success in equipping participants with skills necessary to obtain employment that enables them to financially support themselves and their families in today's economy.</FP>
  <P>(d) It is imperative to empower State, local, and tribal governments and private-sector entities to effectively administer and manage public assistance programs. Federal policies should allow local entities to develop and implement programs and strategies that are best for their respective communities. Specifically, policies should allow the private sector, including community and faith-based organizations, to create solutions that alleviate the need for welfare assistance, promote personal responsibility, and reduce reliance on government intervention and resources.</P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) To promote the proper scope and functioning of government, the Federal Government must afford State, local, and tribal governments the freedom to design and implement programs that better allocate limited resources to meet different community needs.<PRTPAGE P="798"/>
  </FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) States and localities can use such flexibility to devise and evaluate innovative programs that serve diverse populations and families. States and localities can also model their own initiatives on the successful programs of others. To achieve the right balance, Federal leaders must continue to discuss opportunities to improve public assistance programs with State and local leaders, including our Nation's governors.</FP>
  <P>(e) The Federal Government owes it to Americans to use taxpayer dollars for their intended purposes. Relevant agencies should establish clear metrics that measure outcomes so that agencies administering public assistance programs can be held accountable. These metrics should include assessments of whether programs help individuals and families find employment, increase earnings, escape poverty, and avoid long-term dependence. Whenever possible, agencies should harmonize their metrics to facilitate easier cross-programmatic comparisons and to encourage further integration of service delivery at the local level. Agencies should also adopt policies to ensure that only eligible persons receive benefits and enforce all relevant laws providing that aliens who are not otherwise qualified and eligible may not receive benefits.</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) All entities that receive funds should be required to guarantee the integrity of the programs they administer. Technology and innovation should drive initiatives that increase program integrity and reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the current system.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) The Federal Government must support State, local, and tribal partners by investing in tools to combat payment errors and verify eligibility for program participants. It must also work alongside public and private partners to assist recipients of welfare assistance to maximize access to services and benefits that support paths to self-sufficiency.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Review of Regulations and Guidance Documents</E>. (a) The Secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education (Secretaries) shall:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) review all regulations and guidance documents of their respective agencies relating to waivers, exemptions, or exceptions for public assistance program eligibility requirements to determine whether such documents are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the principles outlined in this order;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) review any public assistance programs of their respective agencies that do not currently require work for receipt of benefits or services, and determine whether enforcement of a work requirement would be consistent with Federal law and the principles outlined in this order;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) review any public assistance programs of their respective agencies that do currently require work for receipt of benefits or services, and determine whether the enforcement of such work requirements is consistent with Federal law and the principles outlined in this order;</FP>

  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> (a) The United States Postal Service (USPS) accounts for almost half of global mail volume and is regularly cited as the Federal agency with the highest public approval rating. However, a number of factors, including the steep decline in First-Class Mail volume, coupled with legal mandates that compel the USPS to incur substantial and inflexible costs, have resulted in a structural deficit where revenues are no longer sufficient to fund the pension liabilities and retiree health obligations owed to current employees. The USPS is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout. This finding is supported by the following considerations, among others:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the USPS has incurred $65 billion of cumulative losses since the 2007-2009 recession;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the USPS has been unable to make payments required by law for its retiree health benefit obligations, which totaled more than $38 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) the Government Accountability Office has had the USPS on its high-risk list since 2009 because of a serious financial situation that puts the USPS mission of providing prompt, reliable, and efficient universal mail services at risk.</FP>
  <P>(b) It shall be the policy of my Administration that the United States postal system operate under a sustainable business model to provide necessary mail services to citizens and businesses, and to compete fairly in commercial markets.</P>

    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Evaluation.</E> The Task Force shall conduct a thorough evaluation of the operations and finances of the USPS, including:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS's role in competitive markets;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the decline in mail volume and its implications for USPS self-financing and the USPS monopoly over letter delivery and mailboxes;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) the definition of the “universal service obligation” in light of changes in technology, e-commerce, marketing practices, and customer needs;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) the USPS role in the U.S. economy and in rural areas, communities, and small towns; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(v) the state of the USPS business model, workforce, operations, costs, and pricing.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Recommendations for Reform.</E> The Task Force shall develop recommendations for administrative and legislative reforms to the United States postal system.</FP>
  <P>(a) Such recommendations shall promote our Nation's commerce and communication without shifting additional costs to taxpayers. The recommendations shall be developed in a manner that is consistent with the proposed plan to reorganize the executive branch as required by Executive Order 13781 of March 13, 2017.</P>
  <P>(b) Such recommendations shall also consider the views of the USPS workforce; commercial, non-profit, and residential users of the USPS services; and competitors in the marketplace.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Report.</E> The Task Force, acting through the Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall submit a report to the President, in coordination with the Directors of the Domestic Policy and National Economic Councils, not later than 120 days after the date of this order. In its report, the Task Force shall summarize its findings and recommendations under sections 3 and 4 of this order.</FP>

The executive branch wants faith-based and community organizations, to the fullest opportunity permitted by law, to compete on a level playing field for grants, contracts, programs, and other Federal funding opportunities. The efforts of faith-based and community organizations are essential to revitalizing communities, and the Federal Government welcomes opportunities to partner with such organizations through innovative, measurable, and outcome-driven initiatives.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Enhancing Noncompetitive Civil Service Appointments of Military Spouses</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1784 of title 10, United States Code, and sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (a) “Military spouse” means:</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the husband or wife of a member of the Armed Forces who, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, is performing active duty pursuant <PRTPAGE P="809"/>to orders that authorize a permanent change of station move, if such husband or wife relocates to the member's new permanent duty station;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the husband or wife of a totally disabled retired or separated member of the Armed Forces; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) the unremarried widow or widower of a member of the Armed Forces killed while performing active duty.</FP>
  <P>(b) “Member of the Armed Forces” has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 315.612(b)(4).</P>
  <P>(c) “Agency” has the meaning set forth in section 3330d of title 5, United States Code.</P>
  <P>(d) “Military spouse hiring authority” shall refer to the appointment authority set forth in 5 U.S.C. 3330d and 5 CFR 315.612.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> (a) Military spouses make critical contributions to the personal and financial success of our military families. Military service of spouses, however, often impairs the spouse's ability to obtain and maintain employment, and to achieve career goals. Multiple and frequent relocations make it challenging for military spouses to maintain the home front, to comply with licensure and other job requirements, and to obtain adequate childcare.</FP>
  <P>(b) It shall be the policy of the United States to enhance employment support for military spouses. This policy will assist agencies in tapping into a pool of talented individuals and will promote the national interest of the United States and the well-being of our military families. It will also help retain members of the Armed Forces, enhance military readiness, recognize the tremendous sacrifices and service of the members of our Armed Forces and their families, and decrease the burden of regulations that can inhibit the entry of military spouses into the workforce.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Promoting Hiring for Military Spouses.</E> (a) To the greatest extent possible consistent with hiring needs, agencies shall, when filling vacant positions in the competitive service, indicate in job opportunity announcements (JOAs) that they will consider candidates under the military spouse hiring authority in addition to candidates identified on the competitive or merit promotion certificate for the position as well as those candidates identified through any other hiring authority a JOA indicates an agency will consider.</FP>
  <P>(b) Agencies shall actively advertise and promote the military spouse hiring authority and actively solicit applications from military spouses for posted and other agency positions (including through USAJOBS).</P>
  <P>(c) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall consider whether changes to 5 CFR 315.612 are appropriate to account for cases in which there are no agency job openings within the geographic area of the permanent duty station of the member of the Armed Forces for which the member's spouse is qualified.</P>

  <P>(d) OPM shall also periodically circulate notifications concerning the military spouse hiring authority and its eligibility requirements to each agency's Chief Human Capital Officer or the agency's equivalent officer, for such officer to transmit to appropriate offices and to notify eligible populations. Within 180 days of the date of this order, OPM shall post to its website, and circulate to each agency's Chief Human Capital Officer or the <PRTPAGE P="810"/>agency's equivalent officer, information about the military spouse hiring authority. That posting shall include a discussion of section 1131 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Public Law 114-328, which amended 5 U.S.C. 3330d(c) to eliminate the time limitation on noncompetitive appointment for a relocating spouse of a member of the Armed Forces.</P>
  <P>(e) Within 180 days of the date of this order, OPM shall educate agencies concerning the military spouse hiring authority and ensure human resources personnel and hiring managers are briefed on techniques for its effective use. Concurrently, within 180 days of the date of this order, OPM shall provide any additional clarifying guidance it deems appropriate to agencies on provisions of the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010, Public Law 111-292, and agencies shall ensure that human resources personnel and hiring managers are briefed as needed on techniques for the effective use of telework.</P>
  <P>(f) Beginning in Fiscal Year 2019, agencies shall report annually (by December 31 of each year) to OPM and the Department of Labor the number of positions made available under the military spouse hiring authority, the number of applications submitted under the military spouse hiring authority, and the number of military spouses appointed under the military spouse hiring authority during the preceding fiscal year. Such report shall also describe actions taken during that period to advertise the military spouse hiring authority, as well as any other actions taken to promote the hiring of military spouses.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Administrative Provisions.</E> (a) The Director of OPM shall administer this order and shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Labor, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, provide an annual report to the President regarding the implementation of this order and any recommendations for improving the hiring of military spouses, including steps to enhance the effectiveness of the military spouse hiring authority.</FP>
  <P>(b) The annual report described in subsection (a) of this section shall also include recommendations, developed in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, for actions that could be taken to improve license portability and remove barriers to the employment of military spouses.</P>

    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>

  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Federal Government spends more than $90 billion annually on information technology (IT). The vast majority of this sum is consumed in maintaining legacy IT infrastructure that is often ineffective and more costly than modern technologies. Modern IT systems would enable agencies to reduce costs, mitigate cybersecurity risks, and deliver improved services to the American people. While the recently enacted Modernizing Government Technology Act will provide needed financial resources to help transition agencies to more effective, efficient, and secure technologies, more can be done to improve management of IT resources. Department and agency (agency) Chief Information Officers (CIOs) generally do not have adequate visibility into, or control over, their agencies' IT resources, resulting in duplication, waste, and poor service delivery. Enhancing the effectiveness of agency CIOs will better position agencies to modernize their IT systems, execute IT programs more efficiently, reduce cybersecurity risks, and serve the American people well.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the executive branch to:</FP>

  <P>(b) the term “information technology” has the meaning given that term in 40 U.S.C. 11101(6);</P>
  <P>(c) the term “Chief Information Officer” or “CIO” means the individual within a covered agency as described in 40 U.S.C. 11315;</P>

  <P>(d) the term “component Chief Information Officer” or “component CIO” means an individual in a covered agency, other than the CIO referred to in subsection (c) of this section, who has the title Chief Information Officer, <PRTPAGE P="812"/>or who functions in the capacity of a CIO, and has IT management authorities over a component of the agency similar to those the CIO has over the entire agency;</P>
  <P>(e) the term “IT position” means a position within the job family standard for the Information Technology Management Series, GS-2210, as defined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families and related guidance.</P>

  <P>(d) consistent with 40 U.S.C. 11319(b)(2) and other applicable law, the CIO of the covered agency approves the appointment of any component CIO in that agency.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Agency-wide IT Consolidation.</E> Consistent with the purposes of Executive Order 13781 of March 13, 2017 (Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch), the head of each covered agency shall take all necessary and appropriate action to:</FP>

  <P>(a) consistent with 40 U.S.C. 11315(c)(3), the CIO assesses and advises the agency head regarding knowledge and skill standards established for agency IT personnel;</P>
  <P>(b) the established knowledge and skill standards are included in the performance standards and reflected in the performance evaluations of all component CIOs, and that the CIO is responsible for that portion of the evaluation; and</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Developing Efficient, Effective, and Cost-Reducing Approaches To Federal Sector Collective Bargaining</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to assist executive departments and agencies (agencies) in developing efficient, effective, and cost-reducing collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), as described in chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy</E>. (a) Section 7101(b) of title 5, United States Code, requires the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government. Unfortunately, implementation of the Statute has fallen short of these goals. CBAs, and other agency agreements with collective bargaining representatives, often make it harder for agencies to reward high performers, hold low-performers accountable, or flexibly respond to operational needs. Many agencies and collective bargaining representatives spend years renegotiating CBAs, with taxpayers paying for both sides' negotiators. Agencies must also engage in prolonged negotiations before making even minor operational changes, like relocating office space.</FP>

  <P>(b) The Federal Government must do more to apply the Statute in a manner consistent with effective and efficient Government. To fulfill this obligation, agencies should secure CBAs that:  promote an effective and efficient means of accomplishing agency missions; encourage the highest levels of employee performance and ethical conduct; ensure employees are accountable for their conduct and performance on the job; expand agency flexibility to address operational needs; reduce the cost of agency operations, including with respect to the use of taxpayer-funded union time; are consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations; do not cover matters that are not, by law, subject to bargaining; and preserve management rights under section 7106(a) of title 5, United States Code (management rights). Further, agencies that form part of an effective and efficient Government should not take more than a year to renegotiate CBAs.<PRTPAGE P="820"/>
  </P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Definitions</E>. For purposes of this order:</FP>
  <P>(a) The phrase “term CBA” means a CBA of a fixed or indefinite duration reached through substantive bargaining, as opposed to (i) agreements reached through impact and implementation bargaining pursuant to sections 7106(b)(2) and 7106(b)(3) of title 5, United States Code, or (ii) mid-term agreements, negotiated while the basic comprehensive labor contract is in effect, about subjects not included in such contract.</P>
  <P>(b) The phrase “taxpayer-funded union time” means time granted to a Federal employee to perform non-agency business during duty hours pursuant to section 7131 of title 5, United States Code.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Interagency Labor Relations Working Group</E>. (a) There is hereby established an Interagency Labor Relations Working Group (Labor Relations Group).</FP>
  <P>(b) <E T="03"> Organization</E>. The Labor Relations Group shall consist of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM Director), representatives of participating agencies determined by their agency head in consultation with the OPM Director, and OPM staff assigned by the OPM Director. The OPM Director shall chair the Labor Relations Group and, subject to the availability of appropriations and to the extent permitted by law, provide administrative support for the Labor Relations Group.</P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Agencies</E>. Agencies with at least 1,000 employees represented by a collective bargaining representative pursuant to chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, shall participate in the Labor Relations Group. Agencies with a smaller number of employees represented by a collective bargaining representative may, at the election of their agency head and with the concurrence of the OPM Director, participate in the Labor Relations Group. Agencies participating in the Labor Relations Group shall provide assistance helpful in carrying out the responsibilities outlined in subsection (d) of this section. Such assistance shall include designating an agency employee to serve as a point of contact with OPM responsible for providing the Labor Relations Group with sample language for proposals and counter-proposals on significant matters proposed for inclusion in term CBAs, as well as for analyzing and discussing with OPM and the Labor Relations Group the effects of significant CBA provisions on agency effectiveness and efficiency. Participating agencies should provide other assistance as necessary to support the Labor Relations Group in its mission.</P>
  <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsibilities and Functions</E>. The Labor Relations Group shall assist the OPM Director on matters involving labor-management relations in the executive branch. To the extent permitted by law, its responsibilities shall include the following:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Gathering information to support agency negotiating efforts, including the submissions required under section 8 of this order, and creating an inventory of language on significant subjects of bargaining that have relevance to more than one agency and that have been proposed for inclusion in at least one term CBA;</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) Developing model ground rules for negotiations that, if implemented, would minimize delay, set reasonable limits for good-faith negotiations, call for Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to mediate <PRTPAGE P="821"/>disputed issues not resolved within a reasonable time, and, as appropriate, promptly bring remaining unresolved issues to the Federal Service Impasses Panel (the Panel) for resolution;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) Analyzing provisions of term CBAs on subjects of bargaining that have relevance to more than one agency, particularly those that may infringe on, or otherwise affect, reserved management rights. Such analysis should include an assessment of term CBA provisions that cover comparable subjects, without infringing, or otherwise affecting, reserved management rights. The analysis should also assess the consequences of such CBA provisions on Federal effectiveness, efficiency, cost of operations, and employee accountability and performance. The analysis should take particular note of how certain provisions may impede the policies set forth in section 1 of this order or the orderly implementation of laws, rules, or regulations. The Labor Relations Group may examine general trends and commonalities across term CBAs, and their effects on bargaining-unit operations, but need not separately analyze every provision of each CBA in every Federal bargaining unit;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) Sharing information and analysis, as appropriate and permitted by law, including significant proposals and counter-proposals offered in bargaining, in order to reduce duplication of efforts and encourage common approaches across agencies, as appropriate;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(v) Establishing ongoing communications among agencies engaging with the same labor organizations in order to facilitate common solutions to common bargaining initiatives; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(vi) Assisting the OPM Director in developing, where appropriate, Government-wide approaches to bargaining issues that advance the policies set forth in section 1 of this order.</FP>
  <P>(e) Within 18 months of the first meeting of the Labor Relations Group, the OPM Director, as the Chair of the group, shall submit to the President, through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a report proposing recommendations for meeting the goals set forth in section 1 of this order and for improving the organization, structure, and functioning of labor relations programs across agencies.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Collective Bargaining Objectives</E>. (a) The head of each agency that engages in collective bargaining under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, shall direct appropriate officials within each agency to prepare a report on all operative term CBAs at least 1 year before their expiration or renewal date. The report shall recommend new or revised CBA language the agency could seek to include in a renegotiated agreement that would better support the objectives of section 1 of this order. The officials preparing the report shall consider the analysis and advice of the Labor Relations Group in making recommendations for revisions. To the extent permitted by law, these reports shall be deemed guidance and advice for agency management related to collective bargaining under section 7114(b)(4)(C) of title 5, United States Code, and thus not subject to disclosure to the exclusive representative or its authorized representative.</FP>

  <P>(b) Consistent with the requirements and provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, and other applicable laws and regulations, an agency, when negotiating with a collective bargaining representative, shall:<PRTPAGE P="822"/>
  </P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) establish collective bargaining objectives that advance the policies of section 1 of this order, with such objectives informed, as appropriate, by the reports required by subsection (a) of this section;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) consider the analysis and advice of the Labor Relations Group in establishing these collective bargaining objectives and when evaluating collective bargaining representative proposals;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) make every effort to secure a CBA that meets these objectives; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) ensure management and supervisor participation in the negotiating team representing the agency.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Collective Bargaining Procedures</E>. (a) To achieve the purposes of this order, agencies shall begin collective bargaining negotiations by making their best effort to negotiate ground rules that minimize delay, set reasonable time limits for good-faith negotiations, call for FMCS mediation of disputed issues not resolved within those time limits, and, as appropriate, promptly bring remaining unresolved issues to the Panel for resolution. For collective bargaining negotiations, a negotiating period of 6 weeks or less to achieve ground rules, and a negotiating period of between 4 and 6 months for a term CBA under those ground rules, should ordinarily be considered reasonable and to satisfy the “effective and efficient” goal set forth in section 1 of this order. Agencies shall commit the time and resources necessary to satisfy these temporal objectives and to fulfill their obligation to bargain in good faith. Any negotiations to establish ground rules that do not conclude after a reasonable period should, to the extent permitted by law, be expeditiously advanced to mediation and, as necessary, to the Panel.</FP>
  <P>(b) During any collective bargaining negotiations under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, and consistent with section 7114(b) of that chapter, the agency shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on a term CBA, memorandum of understanding (MOU), or any other type of binding agreement that promotes the policies outlined in section 1 of this order. If such negotiations last longer than the period established by the CBA ground rules -- or, absent a pre-set deadline, a reasonable time -- the agency shall consider whether requesting assistance from the FMCS and, as appropriate, the Panel, would better promote effective and efficient Government than would continuing negotiations. Such consideration should evaluate the likelihood that continuing negotiations without FMCS assistance or referral to the Panel would produce an agreement consistent with the goals of section 1 of this order, as well as the cost to the public of continuing to pay for both agency and collective bargaining representative negotiating teams. Upon the conclusion of the sixth month of any negotiation, the agency head shall receive notice from appropriate agency staff and shall receive monthly notifications thereafter regarding the status of negotiations until they are complete. The agency head shall notify the President through OPM of any negotiations that have lasted longer than 9 months, in which the assistance of the FMCS either has not been requested or, if requested, has not resulted in agreement or advancement to the Panel.</P>

  <P>(c) If the commencement or any other stage of bargaining is delayed or impeded because of a collective bargaining representative's failure to comply with the duty to negotiate in good faith pursuant to section 7114(b) of title 5, United States Code, the agency shall, consistent with applicable law consider whether to:<PRTPAGE P="823"/>
  </P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) file an unfair labor practice (ULP) complaint under section 7118 of title 5, United States Code, after considering evidence of bad-faith negotiating, including refusal to meet to bargain, refusal to meet as frequently as necessary, refusal to submit proposals or counterproposals, undue delays in bargaining, undue delays in submission of proposals or counterproposals, inadequate preparation for bargaining, and other conduct that constitutes bad-faith negotiating; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) propose a new contract, memorandum, or other change in agency policy and implement that proposal if the collective bargaining representative does not offer counter-proposals in a timely manner.</FP>
  <P>(d) An agency's filing of a ULP complaint against a collective bargaining representative shall not further delay negotiations. Agencies shall negotiate in good faith or request assistance from the FMCS and, as appropriate, the Panel, while a ULP complaint is pending.</P>
  <P>(e) In developing proposed ground rules, and during any negotiations, agency negotiators shall request the exchange of written proposals, so as to facilitate resolution of negotiability issues and assess the likely effect of specific proposals on agency operations and management rights. To the extent that an agency's CBAs, ground rules, or other agreements contain requirements for a bargaining approach other than the exchange of written proposals addressing specific issues, the agency should, at the soonest opportunity, take steps to eliminate them. If such requirements are based on now-revoked Executive Orders, including Executive Order 12871 of October 1, 1993 (Labor-Management Partnerships) and Executive Order 13522 of December 9, 2009 (Creating Labor-Management Forums to Improve Delivery of Government Services), agencies shall take action, consistent with applicable law, to rescind these requirements.</P>
  <P>(f) Pursuant to section 7114(c)(2) of title 5, United States Code, the agency head shall review all binding agreements with collective bargaining representatives to ensure that all their provisions are consistent with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. When conducting this review, the agency head shall ascertain whether the agreement contains any provisions concerning subjects that are non-negotiable, including provisions that violate Government-wide requirements set forth in any applicable Executive Order or any other applicable Presidential directive. If an agreement contains any such provisions, the agency head shall disapprove such provisions, consistent with applicable law. The agency head shall take all practicable steps to render the determinations required by this subsection within 30 days of the date the agreement is executed, in accordance with section 7114(c) of title 5, United States Code, so as not to permit any part of an agreement to become effective that is contrary to applicable law, rule, or regulation.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 6</E>. <E T="03">Permissive Bargaining</E>. The heads of agencies subject to the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, may not negotiate over the substance of the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and shall instruct subordinate officials that they may not negotiate over those same subjects.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 7</E>. <E T="03">Efficient Bargaining over Procedures and Appropriate Arrangements</E>. (a) Before beginning negotiations during a term CBA over matters addressed by sections 7106(b)(2) or 7106(b)(3) of title 5, United States Code, agencies shall evaluate whether or not such matters are already covered by the term CBA and therefore are not subject to the duty to bargain. <PRTPAGE P="824"/>If such matters are already covered by a term CBA, the agency shall not bargain over such matters.</FP>
  <P>(b) Consistent with section 1 of this order, agencies that engage in bargaining over procedures pursuant to section 7106(b)(2) of title 5, United States Code, shall, consistent with their obligation to negotiate in good faith, bargain over only those items that constitute procedures associated with the exercise of management rights, which do not include measures that excessively interfere with the exercise of such rights. Likewise, consistent with section 1 of this order, agencies that engage in bargaining over appropriate arrangements pursuant to section 7106(b)(3) of title 5, United States Code, shall, consistent with their obligation to negotiate in good faith, bargain over only those items that constitute appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights. In such negotiations, agencies shall ensure that a resulting appropriate arrangement does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management rights.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 8</E>. <E T="03">Public Accessibility</E>. (a) Each agency subject to chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, that engages in any negotiation with a collective bargaining representative, as defined therein, shall submit to the OPM Director each term CBA currently in effect and its expiration date. Such agency shall also submit any new term CBA and its expiration date to the OPM Director within 30 days of its effective date, and submit new arbitral awards to the OPM Director within 10 business days of receipt. The OPM Director shall make each term CBA publicly accessible on the Internet as soon as practicable.</FP>
  <P>(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the OPM Director shall prescribe a reporting format for submissions required by subsection (a) of this section. Within 30 days of the OPM Director's having prescribed the reporting format, agencies shall use this reporting format and make the submissions required under subsection (a) of this section.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 9</E>. <E T="03"> General Provisions</E>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>

  <P>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>
  <P>(c) Nothing in this order shall abrogate any CBA in effect on the date of this order.</P>
  <P>(d) The failure to produce a report for the agency head prior to the termination or renewal of a CBA under section 4(a) of this order shall not prevent an agency from opening a CBA for renegotiation.</P>

  <P>(e) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party <PRTPAGE P="825"/>against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

  <EAR>EO 13837</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Ensuring Transparency, Accountability, and Efficiency in Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Use</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, and to ensure the effective functioning of the executive branch, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose</E>. An effective and efficient government keeps careful track of how it spends the taxpayers' money and eliminates unnecessary, inefficient, or unreasonable expenditures. To advance this policy, executive branch employees should spend their duty hours performing the work of the Federal Government and serving the public.</FP>
  <FP>Federal law allows Federal employees to represent labor organizations and perform other non-agency business while being paid by American taxpayers (taxpayer-funded union time). The Congress, however, has also instructed the executive branch to interpret the law in a manner consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient government.</FP>
  <FP>To that end, agencies should ensure that taxpayer-funded union time is used efficiently and authorized in amounts that are reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. Federal employees should spend the clear majority of their duty hours working for the public. No agency should pay for Federal labor organizations' expenses, except where required by law. Agencies should eliminate unrestricted grants of taxpayer-funded union time and instead require employees to obtain specific authorization before using such time. Agencies should also monitor use of taxpayer-funded union time, ensure it is used only for authorized purposes, and make information regarding its use readily available to the public.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Definitions</E>. For purposes of this order, the following definitions shall apply:</FP>
  <P>(a) Except for purposes of section 4 of this order, “agency” has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(3) of title 5, United States Code, but includes only executive agencies. For purposes of section 4 of this order, “agency” has the meaning given to “Executive agency” in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but excludes the Government Accountability Office.</P>

  <P>(b) “Agency business” shall mean work performed by Federal employees, including detailees or assignees, on behalf of an agency, but does not include work performed on taxpayer-funded union time.<PRTPAGE P="826"/>
  </P>
  <P>(c) “Bargaining unit” shall mean a group of employees represented by an exclusive representative in an appropriate unit for collective bargaining under subchapter II of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code.</P>
  <P>(d) “Discounted use of government property” means charging less to use government property than the value of the use of such property, as determined by the General Services Administration, where applicable, or otherwise by the generally prevailing commercial cost of using such property.</P>
  <P>(e) “Employee” has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code, except for purposes of section 4 of this order, in which case it means an individual employed in an “Executive agency,” according to the meaning given that term in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but excluding the Government Accountability Office.</P>
  <P>(f) “Grievance” has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(9) of title 5, United States Code.</P>
  <P>(g) “Labor organization” has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(4) of title 5, United States Code.</P>
  <P>(h) “Paid time” shall mean time for which an employee is paid by the Federal Government, including both duty time, in which the employee performs agency business, and taxpayer-funded union time. It does not include time spent on paid or unpaid leave, or an employee's off-duty hours.</P>
  <P>(i) “Taxpayer-funded union time” shall mean official time granted to an employee pursuant to section 7131 of title 5, United States Code.</P>
  <P>(j) “Union time rate” shall mean the total number of duty hours in the fiscal year that employees in a bargaining unit used for taxpayer-funded union time, divided by the number of employees in such bargaining unit.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Standards for Reasonable and Efficient Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Usage</E>. (a) No agency shall agree to authorize any amount of taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, unless such time is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. Agreements authorizing taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, that would cause the union time rate in a bargaining unit to exceed 1 hour should, taking into account the size of the bargaining unit, and the amount of taxpayer-funded union time anticipated to be granted under sections 7131(a) and 7131(c) of title 5, United States Code, ordinarily not be considered reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, or to satisfy the “effective and efficient” goal set forth in section 1 of this order and section 7101(b) of title 5, United States Code.

  <EAR>EO 13838</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Exemption From Executive Order 13658 for Recreational Services on Federal Lands</HD>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <E T="03">et seq</E>., and in order to ensure that the Federal Government can economically and efficiently provide the services that allow visitors of all means to enjoy the natural beauty of Federal parks and other Federal lands, it is hereby ordered as follows:<PRTPAGE P="832"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy</E>. Executive Order 13658 of February 12, 2014 (Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors), established a minimum wage to be paid by parties who contract with the Federal Government and applies to outfitters and guides operating on Federal lands. These individuals often conduct multiday recreational tours through Federal lands, and may be required to work substantial overtime hours. The implementation of Executive Order 13658 threatens to raise significantly the cost of guided hikes and tours on Federal lands, preventing many visitors from enjoying the great beauty of America's outdoors. Seasonal recreational workers have irregular work schedules, a high incidence of overtime pay, and an unusually high turnover rate, among other distinguishing characteristics. As a consequence, a minimum wage increase would generally entail large negative effects on hours worked by recreational service workers. Thus, applying Executive Order 13658 to these service contracts does not promote economy and efficiency in making these services available to those who seek to enjoy our Federal lands. That rationale, however, does not apply with the same force to lodging and food services associated with seasonal recreational services, which generally involve more regular work schedules and normal amounts of overtime work. Executive Order 13658 therefore should continue to apply to lodging and food services associated with seasonal recreational services.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Exemption from Executive Order 13658</E>. Section 7(f) of Executive Order 13658 is amended by inserting at its end the following language: “This order shall not apply to contracts or contract-like instruments entered into with the Federal Government in connection with seasonal recreational services or seasonal recreational equipment rental for the general public on Federal lands, but this exemption shall not apply to lodging and food services associated with seasonal recreational services. Seasonal recreational services include river running, hunting, fishing, horseback riding, camping, mountaineering activities, recreational ski services, and youth camps.”</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Agency Implementation</E>. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall promptly take appropriate action to implement this exemption and to ensure that all applicable regulations and agency guidance are consistent with this order. Agencies shall modify existing authorizations and solicitations for contracts or contract-like instruments affected by section 2 of this order by removing clauses requiring compliance with Executive Order 13658 (including the contract clause set forth at title 29, part 10, appendix A, Code of Federal Regulations) as soon as practicable and consistent with applicable law. Agencies shall remove such clauses without impairing the recreational activities or uses authorized by those permits and contracts.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions</E>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13839 of May 25, 2018</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13839</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent With Merit System Principles</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 1104(a)(1), 3301, and 7301 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to ensure the effective functioning of the executive branch, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
    <E T="03">Purpose</E>. Merit system principles call for holding Federal employees accountable for performance and conduct. They state that employees should maintain high standards of integrity, conduct, and concern for the public interest, and that the Federal workforce should be used efficiently and effectively. They further state that employees should be retained based on the adequacy of their performance, inadequate performance should be corrected, and employees should be separated who cannot or will not improve their performance to meet required standards. Unfortunately, implementation of America's civil service laws has fallen far short of these ideals. The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey has consistently found that less than one-third of Federal employees believe that the Government deals with poor performers effectively. Failure to address unacceptable performance and misconduct undermines morale, burdens good performers with subpar colleagues, and inhibits the ability of executive agencies (as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but excluding the Government Accountability Office) (agencies) to accomplish their missions. This order advances the ability of supervisors in agencies to promote civil servant accountability consistent with merit system principles while simultaneously recognizing employees' procedural rights and protections.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Principles for Accountability in the Federal Workforce</E>. (a) Removing unacceptable performers should be a straightforward process that minimizes the burden on supervisors. Agencies should limit opportunity periods to demonstrate acceptable performance under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States Code, to the amount of time that provides sufficient opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.</FP>
  <P>(b) Supervisors and deciding officials should not be required to use progressive discipline. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances.</P>

  <P>(c) Each employee's work performance and disciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action should be calibrated to the specific facts <PRTPAGE P="834"/>and circumstances of each individual employee's situation. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time -- particularly where the employees are in different work units or chains of supervision -- and agencies are not prohibited from removing an employee simply because they did not remove a different employee for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees should be treated equitably, so agencies should consider appropriate comparators as they evaluate potential disciplinary actions.</P>
  <P>(d) Suspension should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate. Agencies should not require suspension of an employee before proposing to remove that employee, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts.</P>
  <P>(e) When taking disciplinary action, agencies should have discretion to take into account an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all past misconduct -- not only similar past misconduct. Agencies should provide an employee with appropriate notice when taking a disciplinary action.</P>
  <P>(f) To the extent practicable, agencies should issue decisions on proposed removals taken under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, within 15 business days of the end of the employee reply period following a notice of proposed removal.</P>
  <P>(g) To the extent practicable, agencies should limit the written notice of adverse action to the 30 days prescribed in section 7513(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code.</P>
  <P>(h) The removal procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code (Chapter 75 procedures), should be used in appropriate cases to address instances of unacceptable performance.</P>
  <P>(i) A probationary period should be used as the final step in the hiring process of a new employee. Supervisors should use that period to assess how well an employee can perform the duties of a job. A probationary period can be a highly effective tool to evaluate a candidate's potential to be an asset to an agency before the candidate's appointment becomes final.</P>
  <P>(j) Following issuance of regulations under section 7 of this order, agencies should prioritize performance over length of service when determining which employees will be retained following a reduction in force.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Standard for Negotiating Grievance Procedures</E>. Whenever reasonable in view of the particular circumstances, agency heads shall endeavor to exclude from the application of any grievance procedures negotiated under section 7121 of title 5, United States Code, any dispute concerning decisions to remove any employee from Federal service for misconduct or unacceptable performance. Each agency shall commit the time and resources necessary to achieve this goal and to fulfill its obligation to bargain in good faith. If an agreement cannot be reached, the agency shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly request the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and, as necessary, the Federal Service Impasses Panel in the resolution of the disagreement. Within 30 days after the adoption of any collective bargaining agreement that fails to achieve this goal, the agency head shall provide an explanation to the President, <PRTPAGE P="835"/>through the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM Director).</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Managing the Federal Workforce</E>. To promote good morale in the Federal workforce, employee accountability, and high performance, and to ensure the effective and efficient accomplishment of agency missions and the efficiency of the Federal service, to the extent consistent with law, no agency shall:</FP>
  <P>(a) subject to grievance procedures or binding arbitration disputes concerning:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the assignment of ratings of record; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the award of any form of incentive pay, including cash awards; quality step increases; or recruitment, retention, or relocation payments;</FP>
  <P>(b) make any agreement, including a collective bargaining agreement:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) that limits the agency's discretion to employ Chapter 75 procedures to address unacceptable performance of an employee;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) that requires the use of procedures under chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code (including any performance assistance period or similar informal period to demonstrate improved performance prior to the initiation of an opportunity period under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States Code), before removing an employee for unacceptable performance; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) that limits the agency's discretion to remove an employee from Federal service without first engaging in progressive discipline; or</FP>
  <P>(c) generally afford an employee more than a 30-day period to demonstrate acceptable performance under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States Code, except when the agency determines in its sole and exclusive discretion that a longer period is necessary to provide sufficient time to evaluate an employee's performance.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Ensuring Integrity of Personnel Files</E>. Agencies shall not agree to erase, remove, alter, or withhold from another agency any information about a civilian employee's performance or conduct in that employee's official personnel records, including an employee's Official Personnel Folder and Employee Performance File, as part of, or as a condition to, resolving a formal or informal complaint by the employee or settling an administrative challenge to an adverse personnel action.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 6</E>. <E T="03">Data Collection of Adverse Actions</E>. (a) For fiscal year 2018, and for each fiscal year thereafter, each agency shall provide a report to the OPM Director containing the following information:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the number of civilian employees in a probationary period or otherwise employed for a specific term who were removed by the agency;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the number of civilian employees reprimanded in writing by the agency;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) the number of civilian employees afforded an opportunity period by the agency under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States Code, breaking out the number of such employees receiving an opportunity period longer than 30 days;</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) the number of adverse personnel actions taken against civilian employees by the agency, broken down by type of adverse personnel action, <PRTPAGE P="836"/>including reduction in grade or pay (or equivalent), suspension, and removal;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(v) the number of decisions on proposed removals by the agency taken under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, not issued within 15 business days of the end of the employee reply period;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(vi) the number of adverse personnel actions by the agency for which employees received written notice in excess of the 30 days prescribed in section 7513(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(vii) the number and key terms of settlements reached by the agency with civilian employees in cases arising out of adverse personnel actions; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(viii) the resolutions of litigation about adverse personnel actions involving civilian employees reached by the agency.</FP>
  <P>(b) Compilation and submission of the data required by subsection (a) of this section shall be conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, including those governing privacy and data security.</P>
  <P>(c) To enhance public accountability of agencies for their management of the Federal workforce, the OPM Director shall, consistent with applicable law, publish the information received under subsection (a) of this section, at the minimum level of aggregation necessary to protect personal privacy. The OPM Director may withhold particular information if publication would unduly risk disclosing information protected by law, including personally identifiable information.</P>
  <P>(d) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the OPM Director shall issue guidance regarding the implementation of this section, including with respect to any exemptions necessary for compliance with applicable law and the reporting format for submissions required by subsection (a) of this section.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 7</E>. <E T="03">Implementation</E>. (a) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the OPM Director shall examine whether existing regulations effectuate the principles set forth in section 2 of this order and the requirements of sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this order. To the extent necessary or appropriate, the OPM Director shall, as soon as practicable, propose for notice and public comment appropriate regulations to effectuate the principles set forth in section 2 of this order and the requirements of sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this order.</FP>
  <P>(b) The head of each agency shall take steps to conform internal agency discipline and unacceptable performance policies to the principles and requirements of this order. To the extent consistent with law, each agency head shall:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) within 45 days of this order, revise its discipline and unacceptable performance policies to conform to the principles and requirements of this order, in areas where new final Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations are not required, and shall further revise such policies as necessary to conform to any new final OPM regulations, within 45 days of the issuance of such regulations; and</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) renegotiate, as applicable, any collective bargaining agreement provisions that are inconsistent with any part of this order or any final OPM regulations promulgated pursuant to this order. Each agency shall give <PRTPAGE P="837"/>any contractually required notice of its intent to alter the terms of such agreement and reopen negotiations.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Ocean Policy To Advance the Economic, Security, and Environmental Interests of the United States</HD>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:<PRTPAGE P="838"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters of the United States are foundational to the economy, security, global competitiveness, and well-being of the United States. Ocean industries employ millions of Americans and support a strong national economy. Domestic energy production from Federal waters strengthens the Nation's security and reduces reliance on imported energy. Our Armed Forces protect our national interests in the ocean and along the Nation's coasts. Goods and materials that support our economy and quality of life flow through maritime commerce. Our fisheries resources help feed the Nation and present tremendous export opportunities. Clean, healthy waters support fishing, boating, and other recreational opportunities for all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>This order maintains and enhances these and other benefits to the Nation through improved public access to marine data and information, efficient interagency coordination on ocean-related matters, and engagement with marine industries, the science and technology community, and other ocean stakeholders. To advance these national interests, this order recognizes and supports Federal participation in regional ocean partnerships, to the extent appropriate and consistent with national security interests and statutory authorities.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It shall be the policy of the United States to:</FP>
  <P>(a) coordinate the activities of executive departments and agencies (agencies) regarding ocean-related matters to ensure effective management of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters and to provide economic, security, and environmental benefits for present and future generations of Americans;</P>
  <P>(b) continue to promote the lawful use of the ocean by agencies, including United States Armed Forces;</P>
  <P>(c) exercise rights and jurisdiction and perform duties in accordance with applicable domestic law and—if consistent with applicable domestic law—international law, including customary international law;</P>
  <P>(d) facilitate the economic growth of coastal communities and promote ocean industries, which employ millions of Americans, advance ocean science and technology, feed the American people, transport American goods, expand recreational opportunities, and enhance America's energy security;</P>
  <P>(e) ensure that Federal regulations and management decisions do not prevent productive and sustainable use of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters;</P>
  <P>(f) modernize the acquisition, distribution, and use of the best available ocean-related science and knowledge, in partnership with marine industries; the ocean science and technology community; State, tribal, and local governments; and other ocean stakeholders, to inform decisions and enhance entrepreneurial opportunity; and</P>

  <P>(g) facilitate, as appropriate, coordination, consultation, and collaboration regarding ocean-related matters, consistent with applicable law, among Federal, State, tribal, and local governments, marine industries, the ocean science and technology community, other ocean stakeholders, and foreign governments and international organizations.<PRTPAGE P="839"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Affording Congress an Opportunity To Address Family Separation</HD>

  <P>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> it is hereby ordered as follows:</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is unfortunate that Congress's failure <PRTPAGE P="842"/>to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this order, the following definitions apply:</FP>
  <P>(a) “Alien family” means</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) any person not a citizen or national of the United States who has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States, who entered this country with an alien child or alien children at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) that person's alien child or alien children.</FP>
  <P>(b) “Alien child” means any person not a citizen or national of the United States who</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) is under the age of 18; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) has a legal parent-child relationship to an alien who entered the United States with the alien child at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Temporary Detention Policy for Families Entering this Country Illegally.</E> (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary), shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members.</FP>
  <P>(b) The Secretary shall not, however, detain an alien family together when there is a concern that detention of an alien child with the child's alien parent would pose a risk to the child's welfare.</P>
  <P>(c) The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law. The Secretary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities.</P>
  <P>(d) Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Secretary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities.</P>

  <P>(e) The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in <E T="03">Flores v. Sessions,</E> CV 85-4544 (“<E T="03">Flores</E> settlement”), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing an Exception to Competitive Examining Rules for Appointment to Certain Positions in the United States Marshals Service, Department of Justice</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Providing Appointment Authority.</E> (a) Good administration of the executive branch necessitates that the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), a component of the Department of Justice, have a hiring authority that is currently available to other Federal law enforcement agencies and that would, among other things, enable the USMS to be competitive in recruiting high-quality Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators, to better hire and retain qualified individuals in certain duty locations, and to more expeditiously fill vacant positions consistent with law enforcement needs. Accordingly, it is appropriate to place Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators of the USMS in Schedule B of the excepted service, as it is impracticable to hold open competition or to apply usual competitive examining procedures for those positions related to Federal law enforcement.</FP>
  <P>(b) Appointments to the positions identified in subsection (a) of this section:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) may not be made to positions of a confidential or policy-determining character or to positions in the Senior Executive Service; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) shall constitute Schedule B appointments that are:</FP>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(A) excepted from the competitive service; and</P>

  <P SOURCE="P1">(B) subject to laws and regulations governing Schedule B appointments, including basic qualification standards established by the Director <PRTPAGE P="844"/>of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) for the applicable occupation and grade level.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Providing Conversion Authority.</E> (a) Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators of the USMS appointed under Schedule B may, upon completion of 3 years of substantially continuous, fully satisfactory service, be converted non-competitively to career appointments, provided they meet the qualifications and other requirements established by the Director.</FP>
  <P>(b) The Director shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to implement this order.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13843 of July 10, 2018</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13843</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Excepting Administrative Law Judges From the Competitive Service</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> The Federal Government benefits from a professional cadre of administrative law judges (ALJs) appointed under section 3105 of title 5, United States Code, who are impartial and committed to the rule of law. As illustrated by the Supreme Court's recent decision in <E T="03">Lucia</E> v. <E T="03">Securities and Exchange Commission,</E> No. 17-130 (June 21, 2018), ALJs are often called upon to discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in conducting proceedings under the laws of the United States. As part of their adjudications, ALJs interact with the public on issues of significance. Especially given the importance of the functions they discharge—which may range from taking testimony and conducting trials to ruling on the admissibility of evidence and enforcing compliance with their <PRTPAGE P="845"/>orders—ALJs must display appropriate temperament, legal acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment. They must also clearly communicate their decisions to the parties who appear before them, the agencies that oversee them, and the public that entrusts them with authority.</FP>

  <FP>Previously, appointments to the position of ALJ have been made through competitive examination and competitive service selection procedures. The role of ALJs, however, has increased over time and ALJ decisions have, with increasing frequency, become the final word of the agencies they serve. Given this expanding responsibility for important agency adjudications, and as recognized by the Supreme Court in <E T="03">Lucia,</E> at least some—and perhaps all—ALJs are “Officers of the United States” and thus subject to the Constitution's Appointments Clause, which governs who may appoint such officials.</FP>
  <FP>As evident from recent litigation, <E T="03">Lucia</E> may also raise questions about the method of appointing ALJs, including whether competitive examination and competitive service selection procedures are compatible with the discretion an agency head must possess under the Appointments Clause in selecting ALJs. Regardless of whether those procedures would violate the Appointments Clause as applied to certain ALJs, there are sound policy reasons to take steps to eliminate doubt regarding the constitutionality of the method of appointing officials who discharge such significant duties and exercise such significant discretion.</FP>
  <FP>Pursuant to my authority under section 3302(1) of title 5, United States Code, I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for the position of ALJ. These conditions include the need to provide agency heads with additional flexibility to assess prospective appointees without the limitations imposed by competitive examination and competitive service selection procedures. Placing the position of ALJ in the excepted service will mitigate concerns about undue limitations on the selection of ALJs, reduce the likelihood of successful Appointments Clause challenges, and forestall litigation in which such concerns have been or might be raised. This action will also give agencies greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in ALJ candidates, such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency. These are all qualities individuals should have before wielding the significant authority conferred on ALJs, and each agency should be able to assess them without proceeding through complicated and elaborate examination processes or rating procedures that do not necessarily reflect the agency's particular needs. This change will also promote confidence in, and the durability of, agency adjudications.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Excepted Service.</E> Appointments of ALJs shall be made under Schedule E of the excepted service, as established by section 3 of this order.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Implementation.</E> (a) Civil Service Rule VI is amended as follows:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) 5 CFR 6.2 is amended to read:</FP>

  <P SOURCE="P1">OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, C, and D, and it shall list the position of administrative law judge in Schedule E, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows:<PRTPAGE P="846"/>
  </P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">Schedule A. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine shall be listed in Schedule A.</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">Schedule B. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B. Appointments to these positions shall be subject to such noncompetitive examination as may be prescribed by OPM.</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">Schedule C. Positions of a confidential or policy-determining character shall be listed in Schedule C.</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">Schedule D. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which the competitive service requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of sufficient numbers of students attending qualifying educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs. These positions, which are temporarily placed in the excepted service to enable more effective recruitment from all segments of society by using means of recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the rules generally applicable to the competitive service, shall be listed in Schedule D.</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">Schedule E. Position of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105. Conditions of good administration warrant that the position of administrative law judge be placed in the excepted service and that appointment to this position not be subject to the requirements of 5 CFR, part 302, including examination and rating requirements, though each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) 5 CFR 6.3(b) is amended to read:</FP>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(b) To the extent permitted by law and the provisions of this part, and subject to the suitability and fitness requirements of the applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations, appointments and position changes in the excepted service shall be made in accordance with such regulations and practices as the head of the agency concerned finds necessary. These shall include, for the position of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105, the requirement that, at the time of application and any new appointment, the individual, other than an incumbent administrative law judge, must possess a professional license to practice law and be authorized to practice law under the laws of a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territorial court established under the United States Constitution. For purposes of this requirement, judicial status is acceptable in lieu of “active” status in States that prohibit sitting judges from maintaining “active” status to practice law, and being in “good standing” is also acceptable in lieu of “active” status in States where the licensing authority considers “good standing” as having a current license to practice law. This requirement shall constitute a minimum standard for appointment to the position of administrative law judge, and such appointments may be subject to additional agency requirements where appropriate.</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) 5 CFR 6.4 is amended to read:</FP>

  <P SOURCE="P1">Except as required by statute, the Civil Service Rules and Regulations shall not apply to removals from positions listed in Schedules A, C, D, <PRTPAGE P="847"/>or E, or from positions excepted from the competitive service by statute. The Civil Service Rules and Regulations shall apply to removals from positions listed in Schedule B of persons who have competitive status.</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) 5 CFR 6.8 is amended to add after subsection (c):</FP>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(d) Effective on July 10, 2018, the position of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105 shall be listed in Schedule E for all levels of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 5372(b). Incumbents of this position who are, on July 10, 2018, in the competitive service shall remain in the competitive service as long as they remain in their current positions.</P>
  <P>(b) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) shall:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) adopt such regulations as the Director determines may be necessary to implement this order, including, as appropriate, amendments to or rescissions of regulations that are inconsistent with, or that would impede the implementation of, this order, giving particular attention to 5 CFR, part 212, subpart D; 5 CFR, part 213, subparts A and C; 5 CFR 302.101; and 5 CFR, part 930, subpart B; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) provide guidance on conducting a swift, orderly transition from the existing appointment process for ALJs to the Schedule E process established by this order.</FP>

    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing the President's National Council for the American Worker</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to provide a coordinated process for developing a national strategy to ensure that America's students and workers have access to affordable, relevant, and innovative education and job training that will equip them to compete and win in the global economy, and for monitoring the implementation of that strategy, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Our Nation is facing a skills crisis. There are currently more than 6.7 million unfilled jobs in the United States, and American workers, who are our country's most valuable resource, need the skills training to fill them. At the same time, the economy is changing at a rapid pace because of the technology, automation, and artificial intelligence that is shaping many industries, from manufacturing to healthcare to retail. For too long, our country's education and job training programs have prepared Americans for the economy of the past. The rapidly changing digital economy requires the United States to view education and training as encompassing more than a single period of time in a traditional classroom. We need to prepare Americans for the 21st century economy and the emerging industries of the future. We must foster an environment of lifelong learning and skills-based training, and cultivate a demand-driven approach to workforce development. My Administration will champion effective, results-driven education and training so that American students and workers can obtain the skills they need to succeed in the jobs of today and of the future.</FP>

In 2017, approximately 89 percent of workers at private-sector establishments with 500 or more workers were offered a retirement plan compared to only 53 percent for workers at private-sector establishments with fewer than 100 workers. Enhancing workplace retirement plan coverage is critical to ensuring that American workers will be financially prepared to retire.</FP>
  <FP>Regulatory burdens and complexity can be costly and discourage employers, especially small businesses, from offering workplace retirement plans to their employees. Businesses are sensitive to the overall expense of setting up such plans. A recent survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that 71 percent of small- and medium-sized businesses that do not offer retirement plans were deterred from doing so by high costs; 37 percent cited high costs as their main reason for not offering such a plan. Federal agencies should revise or eliminate rules and regulations that impose unnecessary costs and burdens on businesses, especially small businesses, and that hinder formation of workplace retirement plans.</FP>
  <FP>Expanding access to multiple employer plans (MEPs), under which employees of different private-sector employers may participate in a single retirement plan, is an efficient way to reduce administrative costs of retirement plan establishment and maintenance and would encourage more plan formation and broader availability of workplace retirement plans, especially among small employers.</FP>

  <FP>Similarly, reducing the number and complexity of employee benefit plan notices and disclosures currently required would ease regulatory burdens. The costs and potential liabilities for employers and plan fiduciaries of complying with existing disclosure requirements may discourage plan formation or maintenance. Improving the effectiveness of required notices and <PRTPAGE P="868"/>disclosures and reducing their cost to employers promote retirement security by expanding access to workplace retirement plans.</FP>
  <FP>Outdated distribution mandates may also reduce plan effectiveness by forcing retirees to make excessively large withdrawals from their accounts—potentially leaving them with insufficient savings in their later years.</FP>
  <FP>In light of the foregoing it shall, therefore, be the policy of the Federal Government to address these problems and promote retirement security for America's workers.</FP>

  <EAR>EO 13848</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election</HD>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</FP>

  <FP>I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the ability of persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine public confidence in United States elections, including through the unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Although there has <PRTPAGE P="870"/>been no evidence of a foreign power altering the outcome or vote tabulation in any United States election, foreign powers have historically sought to exploit America's free and open political system. In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of foreign interference, as illustrated in the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with this threat.</FP>
  <FP>Accordingly, I hereby order:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. (a) Not later than 45 days after the conclusion of a United States election, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall conduct an assessment of any information indicating that a foreign government, or any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of a foreign government, has acted with the intent or purpose of interfering in that election. The assessment shall identify, to the maximum extent ascertainable, the nature of any foreign interference and any methods employed to execute it, the persons involved, and the foreign government or governments that authorized, directed, sponsored, or supported it. The Director of National Intelligence shall deliver this assessment and appropriate supporting information to the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.</FP>
  <P>(b) Within 45 days of receiving the assessment and information described in section 1(a) of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate agencies and, as appropriate, State and local officials, shall deliver to the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Defense a report evaluating, with respect to the United States election that is the subject of the assessment described in section 1(a):</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the extent to which any foreign interference that targeted election infrastructure materially affected the security or integrity of that infrastructure, the tabulation of votes, or the timely transmission of election results; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) if any foreign interference involved activities targeting the infrastructure of, or pertaining to, a political organization, campaign, or candidate, the extent to which such activities materially affected the security or integrity of that infrastructure, including by unauthorized access to, disclosure or threatened disclosure of, or alteration or falsification of, information or data.</FP>

  <FP>The report shall identify any material issues of fact with respect to these matters that the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are unable to evaluate or reach agreement on at the time the report is submitted. The report shall also include updates and recommendations, when appropriate, regarding remedial actions to be taken by the United States Government, other than the sanctions described in sections 2 and 3 of this order.<PRTPAGE P="871"/>
  </FP>
  <P>(c) Heads of all relevant agencies shall transmit to the Director of National Intelligence any information relevant to the execution of the Director's duties pursuant to this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. If relevant information emerges after the submission of the report mandated by section 1(a) of this order, the Director, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate agencies, shall amend the report, as appropriate, and the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall amend the report required by section 1(b), as appropriate.</P>
  <P>(d) Nothing in this order shall prevent the head of any agency or any other appropriate official from tendering to the President, at any time through an appropriate channel, any analysis, information, assessment, or evaluation of foreign interference in a United States election.</P>
  <P>(e) If information indicating that foreign interference in a State, tribal, or local election within the United States has occurred is identified, it may be included, as appropriate, in the assessment mandated by section 1(a) of this order or in the report mandated by section 1(b) of this order, or submitted to the President in an independent report.</P>
  <P>(f) Not later than 30 days following the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall develop a framework for the process that will be used to carry out their respective responsibilities pursuant to this order. The framework, which may be classified in whole or in part, shall focus on ensuring that agencies fulfill their responsibilities pursuant to this order in a manner that maintains methodological consistency; protects law enforcement or other sensitive information and intelligence sources and methods; maintains an appropriate separation between intelligence functions and policy and legal judgments; ensures that efforts to protect electoral processes and institutions are insulated from political bias; and respects the principles of free speech and open debate.</P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) to have directly or indirectly engaged in, sponsored, concealed, or otherwise been complicit in foreign interference in a United States election;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity described in subsection (a)(i) of this section or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</FP>

  <P>(b) Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, as amended by Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, remains in effect. This order is not intended to, and does not, serve to limit the Secretary of the Treasury's discretion to exercise the authorities provided in Executive Order 13694. Where appropriate, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, may exercise the authorities described in Executive Order 13694 or other authorities in conjunction with the Secretary of the Treasury's exercise of authorities provided in this order.</P>
  <P>(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. Following the transmission of the assessment mandated by section 1(a) and the report mandated by section 1(b):</FP>
  <P>(a) the Secretary of the Treasury shall review the assessment mandated by section 1(a) and the report mandated by section 1(b), and, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, impose all appropriate sanctions pursuant to section 2(a) of this order and any appropriate sanctions described in section 2(b) of this order; and</P>
  <P>(b) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other appropriate agencies, shall jointly prepare a recommendation for the President as to whether additional sanctions against foreign persons may be appropriate in response to the identified foreign interference and in light of the evaluation in the report mandated by section 1(b) of this order, including, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, proposed sanctions with respect to the largest business entities licensed or domiciled in a country whose government authorized, directed, sponsored, or supported election interference, including at least one entity from each of the following sectors: financial services, defense, energy, technology, and transportation (or, if inapplicable to that country's largest business entities, sectors of comparable strategic significance to that foreign government). The recommendation shall include an assessment of the effect of the recommended sanctions on the economic and national security interests of the United States and its allies. Any recommended sanctions shall be appropriately calibrated to the scope of the foreign interference identified, and may include one or more of the following with respect to each targeted foreign person:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) blocking and prohibiting all transactions in a person's property and interests in property subject to United States jurisdiction;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) export license restrictions under any statute or regulation that requires the prior review and approval of the United States Government as a condition for the export or re-export of goods or services;</FP>

    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 2 of this order.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. The prohibitions in section 2 of this order include the following:</FP>
  <P>(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</P>
  <P>(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 6</E>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</FP>

  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 8</E>. For the purposes of this order:</FP>
  <P>(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</P>
  <P>(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</P>
  <P>(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person (including a foreign person) in the United States;</P>

  <P>(d) the term “election infrastructure” means information and communications technology and systems used by or on behalf of the Federal Government or a State or local government in managing the election process, <PRTPAGE P="874"/>including voter registration databases, voting machines, voting tabulation equipment, and equipment for the secure transmission of election results;</P>
  <P>(e) the term “United States election” means any election for Federal office held on, or after, the date of this order;</P>

  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 9</E>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 2 of this order.</FP>

  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Fifty-two million Americans live in economically distressed communities. Despite the growing national economy, these communities are plagued by high poverty levels, failing schools, and a scarcity of <PRTPAGE P="888"/>jobs. In December 2017, I signed into law a bill originally introduced as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Act), which established a historic new Federal tax incentive that promotes long-term equity investments in low-income communities designated as “qualified opportunity zones” by the Governors of States or territories. In order to further facilitate such investment, my Administration will implement reforms that streamline existing regulations, protect taxpayers by optimizing use of Federal resources, stimulate economic opportunity and mobility, encourage entrepreneurship, expand quality educational opportunities, develop and rehabilitate quality housing stock, promote workforce development, and promote safety and prevent crime in urban and economically distressed communities.</FP>
  <FP>This order establishes a White House Council to carry out my Administration's plan to encourage public and private investment in urban and economically distressed areas, including qualified opportunity zones. The Council shall lead joint efforts across executive departments and agencies (agencies) to engage with State, local, and tribal governments to find ways to better use public funds to revitalize urban and economically distressed communities.</FP>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13855 of December 21, 2018</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13855</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Active Management of America's Forests, Rangelands, and Other Federal Lands To Improve Conditions and Reduce Wildfire Risk</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
    <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the United States to protect people, communities, and watersheds, and to promote healthy and resilient forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands by actively managing them through partnerships with States, tribes, communities, non-profit organizations, and the private sector. For decades, dense trees and undergrowth have amassed in these lands, fueling catastrophic wildfires. These conditions, along with insect infestation, invasive species, disease, and drought, have weakened our forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands, and have placed communities and homes at risk of damage from catastrophic wildfires.</FP>
  <FP>Active management of vegetation is needed to treat these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed due to challenges associated with regulatory analysis and current consultation requirements. In addition, land designations and policies can reduce emergency responder access to Federal land and restrict management practices that can promote wildfire-resistant landscapes. With the same vigor and commitment that characterizes our efforts to fight wildfires, we must actively manage our forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands to improve conditions and reduce wildfire risk.</FP>

  <FP>In recognition of these regulatory, policy, and coordinating challenges, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretaries) <PRTPAGE P="893"/>each shall implement the following policies in their respective departments:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Shared Management Priorities</E>. The goal of Federal fire management policy for forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands shall be to agree on a set of shared priorities with Federal land managers, States, tribes, and other landowners to manage fire risk across landscapes.</P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Coordinating Federal, State, Tribal, and Local Assets</E>. Wildfire prevention and suppression and post-wildfire restoration require a variety of assets and skills across landscapes. Federal, State, tribal, and local governments should coordinate the deployment of appropriate assets and skills to restore our landscapes and communities after damage caused by fires and to help reduce hazardous fuels through active forest management in order to protect communities, critical infrastructure, and natural and cultural resources.</P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Removing Hazardous Fuels, Increasing Active Management, and Supporting Rural Economies</E>. Post-fire assessments show that reducing vegetation through hazardous fuel management and strategic forest health treatments is effective in reducing wildfire severity and loss. Actions must be taken across landscapes to prioritize treatments in order to enhance fuel reduction and forest-restoration projects that protect life and property, and to benefit rural economies through encouraging utilization of the by-products of forest restoration.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E>
    <E T="03">Goals.</E> (a) To protect communities and watersheds, to better prevent catastrophic wildfires, and to improve the health of America's forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands, the Secretaries shall each develop goals and implementation plans for wildfire prevention activities and programs in their respective departments. In the development of such goals and plans:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) The Secretary of the Interior shall review the Secretary's 2019 budget justifications and give all due consideration to establishing the following objectives for 2019, as feasible and appropriate in light of those budget justifications, and consistent with applicable law and available appropriations:</FP>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(A) Treating 750,000 acres of Department of the Interior (DOI)-administered lands to reduce fuel loads;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(B) Treating 500,000 acres of DOI-administered lands to protect water quality and mitigate severe flooding and erosion risks arising from forest fires;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(C) Treating 750,000 acres of DOI-administered lands for native and invasive species;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(D) Reducing vegetation giving rise to wildfire conditions through forest health treatments by increasing health treatments as part of DOI's offering for sale 600 million board feet of timber from DOI-administered lands; and</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(E) Performing maintenance on public roads needed to provide access for emergency services and restoration work; and</P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) The Secretary of Agriculture shall review the Secretary's 2019 budget justifications and give all due consideration to establishing the following objectives for 2019, as feasible and appropriate in light of those budget <PRTPAGE P="894"/>justifications, and consistent with applicable law and available appropriations:</FP>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(A) Treating 3.5 million acres of Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) lands to reduce fuel load;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(B) Treating 2.2 million acres of USDA FS lands to protect water quality and mitigate severe flooding and erosion risks arising from forest fires;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(C) Treating 750,000 acres of USDA FS lands for native and invasive species;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(D) Reducing vegetation giving rise to wildfire conditions through forest health treatments by increasing health treatments as part of USDA's offering for sale at least 3.8 billion board feet of timber from USDA FS lands; and</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(E) Performing maintenance on roads needed to provide access on USDA FS lands for emergency services and restoration work.</P>
  <P>(b) For the years following establishment of the objectives in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries shall consider annual treatment objectives that meet or exceed those established in subsection (a) of this section, using the full range of available and appropriate management tools, including prescribed burns and mechanical thinning. The Secretaries shall also refine and develop performance metrics to better capture the risk reduction benefits achieved through application of these management tools.</P>
  <P>(c) In conjunction with establishment of goals, and by no later than March 31, 2019, the Secretaries shall identify salvage and log recovery options from lands damaged by fire during the 2017 and 2018 fire seasons, insects, or disease.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3.</E>
    <E T="03">Coordination and Efficient Processes.</E> Effective Federal agency coordination and efficient administrative actions and decisions are essential to improving the condition of America's forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands. To advance the policies set forth in this order and the goals set by the Secretaries, the Secretaries shall:</FP>
  <P>(a) Coordinate with the heads of all relevant Federal agencies to prioritize and promptly implement post-wildfire rehabilitation, salvage, and forest restoration;</P>
  <P>(b) Streamline agency administrative and regulatory processes and policies relating to fuel reduction in forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands and forest restoration when appropriate by:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Adhering to minimum statutory and regulatory time periods, to the maximum extent practicable, for comment, consultation, and administrative review processes related to active management of forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands, including management of wildfire risks;</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) Using all applicable categorical exclusions set forth in law or regulation for fire management, restoration, and other management projects in forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands when implementing the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);<PRTPAGE P="895"/>
  </FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) Consistent with applicable law, developing and using new categorical exclusions to implement active management of forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands; and</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) Immediately prioritizing efforts to reduce the time required to comply with consultation obligations under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E>
    <E T="03">Unmanned Aerial Systems.</E> To reduce fire and forest health risks as described in section 1 of this order, the Secretaries shall, in coordination with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, maximize appropriate use of unmanned aerial systems to accelerate forest management and support firefighting and post-fire rehabilitation in forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5.</E>
    <E T="03">Wildfire Strategy.</E> (a) In collaboration with Federal, State, tribal, and local partners, the Secretaries shall jointly develop, by December 31, 2020, a strategy to support local Federal land managers in project decision-making and inform local fire management decisions related to forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands, thereby protecting habitats and communities, and reducing risks to physical infrastructure.</FP>
  <P>(b) In developing the strategy described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries shall:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Identify DOI- and USDA FS-administered lands with the highest probability of catastrophic wildfires, as well as areas on those lands where there is a high probability that wildfires would threaten people, structures, or other high-value assets, in order to direct and prioritize actions to meet land management goals and to protect communities;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) Examine the costs and challenges relating to management of DOI- and USDA FS-administered lands, including costs associated with wildfire suppression, implementation of applicable statutory requirements, and litigation;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) Review land designations and policies that may limit active forest management and increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires;</FP>

It is the policy of the executive branch to use all viable tools to accelerate the deployment and adoption of affordable, reliable, modern high-speed broadband connectivity in rural America, including rural homes, farms, small businesses, manufacturing and production sites, tribal communities, transportation systems, and healthcare and education facilities. Lowering the costs of broadband deployment to rural areas can strengthen the business case for broadband facilities deployment and therefore amplify investments in broadband infrastructure. To that end, the executive branch will seek to make Federal assets more available for rural broadband deployment, with due consideration of national security concerns.<PRTPAGE P="910"/>

    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Supporting Broadband Deployment</E>. (a) The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall develop a plan to support rural broadband development and adoption by increasing access to tower facilities and other infrastructure assets managed by the Department of the Interior (DOI), consistent with applicable law and to the extent practicable. DOI shall draft model terms and conditions for use in securing tower facilities and other infrastructure assets for broadband deployment.</FP>
  <P>(b) Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary shall report to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy recording DOI's progress in identifying the assets that can be used to support rural broadband deployment and adoption.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process</HD>
  <FP>On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four additional persons who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process. On February 16, 2005, by Executive Order 13372, the President clarified the steps taken in Executive Order 12947.</FP>
  <FP>These terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2018. In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am, therefore, continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process declared in Executive Order 12947.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya</HD>
  <FP>On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and his close associates, which took extreme measures against the people of Libya, including using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed civilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close associates. The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks against civilians, and the increased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries caused a deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its stability.</FP>
  <FP>The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and measures are needed to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuses by members of Qadhafi's family, their associates, and others hindering Libyan national reconciliation.</FP>
  <FP>For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011, must continue in effect beyond February 25, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Application of the Definition of Machinegun to “Bump Fire” Stocks and Other Similar Devices</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Attorney General</HD>

  <FP>After the deadly mass murder in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 1, 2017, I asked my Administration to fully review how the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulates bump fire stocks and similar devices.<PRTPAGE P="917"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Although the Obama Administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns.</FP>

  <FP>Accordingly, following established legal protocols, the Department of Justice started the process of promulgating a Federal regulation interpreting the definition of “machinegun” under Federal law to clarify whether certain bump stock type devices should be illegal. The Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>on December 26, 2017. Public comment concluded on January 25, 2018, with the Department of Justice receiving over 100,000 comments.</FP>
  <FP>Today, I am directing the Department of Justice to dedicate all available resources to complete the review of the comments received, and, as expeditiously as possible, to propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.</FP>
  <FP>Although I desire swift and decisive action, I remain committed to the rule of law and to the procedures the law prescribes. Doing this the right way will ensure that the resulting regulation is workable and effective and leaves no loopholes for criminals to exploit. I would ask that you keep me regularly apprised of your progress.</FP>

  <FP>On March 16, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13661, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to Ukraine undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.<PRTPAGE P="918"/>

  <FP>On March 20, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13662, which further expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, as expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</FP>
  <FP>On December 19, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13685, to take additional steps to address the Russian occupation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.</FP>

  <FP>On August 24, 2017, I issued Executive Order 13808 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, particularly in light of recent actions and policies of the Government of Venezuela, including serious abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms; responsibility for the deepening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela; establishment of an illegitimate Constituent Assembly, which usurped the power of the democratically elected National Assembly and <PRTPAGE P="919"/>other branches of the Government of Venezuela; rampant public corruption; and ongoing repression and persecution of, and violence toward, the political opposition.</FP>

On January 16, 2016, Implementation Day under the JCPOA, the United States lifted nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, by terminating a number of Executive Orders that had been issued pursuant to this national emergency and by taking other actions. Though these measures constitute a significant change in our sanctions posture, comprehensive non-nuclear-related sanctions with respect to Iran remain in place.</FP>
  <FP>Actions and policies of the Government of Iran, including its development of ballistic missiles, support for international terrorism, and human rights abuses continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.</FP>

  <FP>For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12957. The emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, in connection with the hostage crisis. This renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2017.<PRTPAGE P="921"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Actions by the United States Related to the Section 301 Investigation of China's Laws, Policies, Practices, or Actions Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the United States Trade Representative[,] the Senior Advisor for Policy[,] the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy[,] the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs[, and] the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism</HD>
  <FP>On August 14, 2017, I directed the United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) to determine whether to investigate China's laws, policies, practices, or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation, or technology development. On August 18, 2017, the Trade Representative initiated an investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2411).</FP>
  <FP>During its investigation, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) consulted with appropriate advisory committees and the interagency section 301 Committee. The Trade Representative also requested consultations with the Government of China, under section 303 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2413). The USTR held a public hearing on October 10, 2017, and two rounds of public written comment periods. The USTR received approximately 70 written submissions from academics, think tanks, law firms, trade associations, and companies.</FP>
  <FP>The Trade Representative has advised me that the investigation supports the following findings:</FP>
  <FP>First, China uses foreign ownership restrictions, including joint venture requirements, equity limitations, and other investment restrictions, to require or pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities. China also uses administrative review and licensing procedures to require or pressure technology transfer, which, inter alia, undermines the value of U.S. investments and technology and weakens the global competitiveness of U.S. firms.</FP>
  <FP>Second, China imposes substantial restrictions on, and intervenes in, U.S. firms' investments and activities, including through restrictions on technology licensing terms. These restrictions deprive U.S. technology owners of the ability to bargain and set market-based terms for technology transfer. As a result, U.S. companies seeking to license technologies must do so on terms that unfairly favor Chinese recipients.</FP>

  <FP>Third, China directs and facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property and to generate large-scale technology transfer in industries deemed important by Chinese government industrial plans.<PRTPAGE P="924"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Fourth, China conducts and supports unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies. These actions provide the Chinese government with unauthorized access to intellectual property, trade secrets, or confidential business information, including technical data, negotiating positions, and sensitive and proprietary internal business communications, and they also support China's strategic development goals, including its science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic development.</FP>
  <FP>It is hereby directed as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Tariffs.</E> (a) The Trade Representative should take all appropriate action under section 301 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2411) to address the acts, policies, and practices of China that are unreasonable or discriminatory and that burden or restrict U.S. commerce. The Trade Representative shall consider whether such action should include increased tariffs on goods from China.</FP>
  <P>(b) To advance the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative shall publish a proposed list of products and any intended tariff increases within 15 days of the date of this memorandum. After a period of notice and comment in accordance with section 304(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(b)), and after consultation with appropriate agencies and committees, the Trade Representative shall, as appropriate and consistent with law, publish a final list of products and tariff increases, if any, and implement any such tariffs.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">WTO Dispute Settlement.</E> (a) The Trade Representative shall, as appropriate and consistent with law, pursue dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address China's discriminatory licensing practices. Where appropriate and consistent with law, the Trade Representative should pursue this action in cooperation with other WTO members to address China's unfair trade practices.</FP>
  <P>(b) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Trade Representative shall report to me his progress under subsection (a) of this section.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Investment Restrictions.</E> (a) The Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), in consultation with other senior executive branch officials the Secretary deems appropriate, shall propose executive branch action, as appropriate and consistent with law, and using any available statutory authority, to address concerns about investment in the United States directed or facilitated by China in industries or technologies deemed important to the United States.</FP>
  <P>(b) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary shall report to me his progress under subsection (a) of this section.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Domestic Manufacturing and Job Creation—Policies and Procedures Relating to Implementation of Air Quality Standards</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency</HD>
  <FP>Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), Public Law 88-206, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for certain common air pollutants, often referred to as “criteria pollutants,” which it must review every 5 years. Over the past four decades, EPA has revised these standards a number of times to increase their stringency, including revisions to the standards for ozone, particulate matter, and four other criteria pollutants. Since 1970, emissions of criteria pollutants have declined dramatically and air quality has improved significantly. At the same time, each new revision of the NAAQS triggers numerous new planning, permitting, and other requirements for affected States, localities, and regulated entities. In addition, each new revision can affect the planning for and availability of Federal funding for certain new transportation projects.</FP>
  <FP>Under the CAA, States with areas that do not meet revised NAAQS must submit for approval to the Administrator of the EPA (Administrator) State Implementation Plans (SIPs) showing how they will comply with the revised standards. States that fail to submit a SIP or that submit an inadequate SIP risk the imposition of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) that establishes a path to compliance. In addition, manufacturers and other applicants seeking preconstruction permits for new construction generally must demonstrate compliance with the new standards as soon as they go into effect. As the NAAQS have become more stringent, obtaining the air permits needed to construct new manufacturing and industrial facilities or to expand or modernize existing facilities has become increasingly difficult. In some areas, revised NAAQS are approaching what are considered to be “background levels” of pollution (i.e., levels associated with natural sources or emissions originating outside of the United States), leading to significant practical challenges for constructing or expanding manufacturing and industrial facilities. Those challenges range from difficulties in demonstrating compliance to costs and uncertainty associated with permitting delays and emissions-control requirements.</FP>
  <FP>Under the CAA, EPA has also established a Regional Haze Program, which requires States to submit for the Administrator's approval plans that cover 10-year implementation periods and to demonstrate “reasonable progress” toward improving and maintaining visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas. In recent years, States have spent significant time and resources developing Regional Haze Program SIPs. EPA, however, has rejected several of them, in whole or in part, and issued FIPs in their place, which often impose more costly and burdensome measures.</FP>

  <FP>Given the national importance of successful and efficient implementation of air quality standards to promote public health, welfare, and economic growth, this memorandum directs the Administrator to take specific actions <PRTPAGE P="932"/>to ensure efficient and cost-effective implementation of the NAAQS program, including with regard to permitting decisions for new and expanded facilities, and with respect to the Regional Haze Program. These actions are intended to ensure that EPA carries out its core missions of protecting the environment and improving air quality in accord with statutory requirements, while reducing unnecessary impediments to new manufacturing and business expansion essential for a growing economy.</FP>
  <FP>Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby directed as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Timely Processing of State Implementation Plans.</E> The Administrator shall, as practicable and consistent with law, endeavor in all cases to take final action on SIPs within 18 months of the date of the submission of a SIP. This goal applies to all SIPs and SIP revisions submitted pursuant to section 110 of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7410). The Administrator shall consider the expansion of existing performance goals related to the timely processing of SIPs starting with the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 performance plan.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Cooperative Engagement with States to Review Regional Haze Plans.</E> The Administrator shall undertake a process to review all full or partial FIPs issued under the 2007 planning period of the Regional Haze Program and to develop options, at the request of affected States, consistent with law, to replace FIPs with approvable SIPs. The Administrator shall consider the expansion of existing performance goals related to the cooperative engagement with States in EPA's review of Regional Haze Plans starting with the FY 2019 performance plan.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Timely Processing of Preconstruction Permit Applications.</E> The Administrator shall endeavor to take final action on applications for preconstruction permits, as appropriate and consistent with law, within 1 year of the date of receiving a complete application. This 1-year goal applies to all completed applications for preconstruction permits for which EPA is the direct permitting authority under the CAA. The Administrator shall also seek to ensure that determinations relating to the completeness of an application are not unduly delayed. To the extent that a State is the direct permitting authority, EPA shall endeavor to provide prompt technical support, reviews, and determinations, as necessary and consistent with applicable law, in order to assist States in the timely issuance of preconstruction permits. The Administrator shall, starting with the FY 2019 performance plan, develop performance goals related to the timely processing of preconstruction permit applications.</FP>

    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Demonstrations or Petitions Submitted Pursuant to Sections 319 and 179B of the CAA Relating to Emissions Beyond the Control of State and Local Air Agencies.</E> The Administrator shall take the following actions with regard to demonstrations or petitions submitted pursuant to sections 319 and 179B of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7619, 7509a), in order to provide relief to State and local air agencies addressing emissions that are beyond their control:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Timely Processing.</E> With respect to all exceptional event demonstrations submitted pursuant to section 319 of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7619), and <PRTPAGE P="933"/>all demonstrations or petitions relating to international emissions submitted pursuant to section 179B of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7509a), the Administrator shall endeavor to take final action within 120 days of a complete submission, as appropriate and consistent with law. The Administrator shall also endeavor to use available monitoring data and modeling tools to assist States in identifying potential exceptional events and international emissions that may affect concentrations of criteria pollutants. The Administrator shall, starting with the FY 2019 performance plan, develop performance goals related to the timely processing of demonstrations or petitions.</P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Policies Relating to International Emissions.</E> The Administrator shall ensure that EPA continues to take into consideration a State's ability to meet and attain NAAQS that may be affected by international transport of criteria pollutants. With regard to all demonstrations or petitions submitted pursuant to section 179B of the CAA, the Administrator shall also seek to ensure, including through rulemakings or guidance and as appropriate and consistent with law, that EPA does not limit its consideration of demonstrations or petitions to those submitted by States located on the borders of the United States with Mexico or Canada, but rather considers section 179B demonstrations or petitions submitted by any State, including but not limited to those located in the Western United States. Additionally, with respect to section 179B demonstrations or petitions, the Administrator shall ensure that EPA does not limit its consideration to emissions emanating from Mexico or Canada, but rather considers, where appropriate, emissions that may emanate from any location outside the United States, including emissions from Asia.</P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Continuing Assessment.</E> In implementing section 179B of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7509a), section 319 of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7619), and section 182(h) of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7511a(h)), the Administrator shall ensure that EPA continues to assess background concentrations and sources of pollution outside of the control of State and local air agencies that may affect implementation or application of these provisions. Such assessment may include current and future trends in pollution from foreign sources; regional trends in exceptional events, including wildfires, stratospheric ozone intrusions, and volcanic seismic activities; and other events, as appropriate and consistent with law.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Monitoring and Modeling Data.</E> The Administrator shall take the following actions to ensure that monitoring and modeling data is used appropriately in designations, permitting decisions, and demonstrations:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Designations.</E> Given the significant planning, permitting, and other requirements for affected States, localities, and regulated entities associated with nonattainment designations, the Administrator's goal for future designations should be, to the extent feasible and permitted by law, to rely on data from EPA-approved air quality monitors for such designations.</P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Permitting Decisions and Demonstrations.</E>
  </P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Where modeling is necessary for permitting decisions, for State plans, or for exceptional event or international emissions demonstrations, the Administrator shall seek to ensure that EPA's applicable modeling tools <PRTPAGE P="934"/>are sufficiently accurate for their intended application; and that the relevant State or local air agency, or permit applicant as applicable, is consulted regarding whether the use of modeling projections in lieu of monitored data is appropriate. The Administrator should also seek to streamline EPA's processes for considering and approving inputs to models and updates to modeling techniques, including updates to account for site-specific conditions. Where EPA-approved models are not representative of site conditions or planned activities, the Administrator shall seek, as appropriate and consistent with law, to streamline the process for approving alternative models and to provide for other methods that promote innovative State approaches.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) The Administrator shall, consistent with law, continue to take actions, such as setting significant impact levels and related values, that enable EPA to clearly identify the types or classes of permitting and related decisions that do not require modeling or that can rely on streamlined modeling approaches. This requirement is especially important in areas for which EPA concludes that permits need to demonstrate compliance with NAAQS that have yet to be fully implemented. In developing significant impact levels, EPA should, as appropriate and consistent with law, allow for natural variability in meteorological conditions and industrial processes.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 6</E>. <E T="03">Offsets.</E> To the extent consistent with law and air quality improvement, the Administrator shall provide flexibility to States with regard to identifying and achieving offsets, including by allowing intrastate and regional inter-precursor trading. These efforts should include development and implementation of flexible offset policies in rural areas where few facilities exist to generate offsets, in order to promote their economic expansion. The Administrator shall examine steps to help regions and States benefit from flexibilities available in the permitting process for new facilities and projects.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 7</E>. <E T="03">Future NAAQS Reviews.</E> The Administrator shall evaluate whether EPA is complying fully with the requirements of section 109(d)(2)(C) of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7409(d)(2)(C)) relating to the scope and characterization of advice provided by its Clean Air Act Scientific Advisory Committee, including requirements that the Committee advise the Administrator regarding background concentrations and adverse public health or other effects that may result from implementation of revised air quality standards. In addition, the Administrator shall examine the current NAAQS review process and develop criteria to ensure transparency in the evaluation, assessment, and characterization of scientific evidence in such reviews. The Administrator shall also develop clear guidance for differentiating the role of science and policy considerations in establishing NAAQS.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 8</E>. <E T="03">Timely Issuance of Implementing Regulations and Guidance.</E> When issuing any final rule establishing or revising NAAQS, the Administrator shall, where appropriate and consistent with law, concurrently issue regulations and guidance necessary for implementing the new or revised standards. The regulations and guidance shall specify the information that is relevant to the submission and consideration of SIPs and preconstruction permit applications.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 9</E>. <E T="03">Review of Rules, Guidance, Memoranda, and Procedures Relating to State Implementation Plans and Permitting.</E> The Administrator shall <PRTPAGE P="935"/>evaluate EPA's existing rules, guidance, memoranda, and other public documents relating to the implementation of NAAQS, including documents that relate to the submission and consideration of preconstruction permit applications. The Administrator shall, consistent with law, determine whether any such documents should be revised or rescinded to ensure more timely permitting decisions under the NAAQS. Any resulting revisions or rescissions should seek, among other things, to provide States with additional implementation flexibility. The Administrator should also evaluate the adequacy of existing internal review procedures to determine whether they can be improved to ensure prompt evaluation and timely action on new and pending SIPs and permit applications.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 10</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>

  <MEMO>Memorandum of April 26, 2018</MEMO>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>As I explained in my temporary certification of October 26, 2017, the American people expect their Government to provide as much access as possible to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records (records) so that they may—as they deserve—finally be fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event. Over the past 180 days, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have reviewed all of the information within records temporarily withheld from release and have proposed to the Archivist of the United States (Archivist) that certain information should continue to be redacted because of identifiable national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns. The Archivist has reviewed the information agencies proposed to withhold and believes the proposals are consistent with the standard of section 5(g)(2)(D) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107 note) (the “Act”).</FP>
  <FP>I agree with the Archivist's recommendation that the continued withholdings are necessary to protect against identifiable harm to national security, law enforcement, or foreign affairs that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure. I am also ordering agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next 3 years. At any time during that review period, and no later than the end of that period, agencies shall disclose information that no longer warrants continued withholding.</FP>
  <FP>Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President and Commander in Chief by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby certify that all information within records that agencies have proposed for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act shall be withheld from full public disclosure until no later than October 26, 2021.</FP>

  <FP>Any agency that seeks further postponement beyond this certification shall take note of the findings of the Act, which state, among other things, that “only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of such records.” The need for continued protection can only grow weaker with the passage of time from this congressional finding. Any agency that seeks further postponement beyond October 26, 2021, shall, no later than April 26, 2021, identify to the Archivist the specific basis for concluding that records (or portions of records) satisfy the standard for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act. Thereafter, the Archivist shall recommend to the President, no later than September 26, <PRTPAGE P="937"/>2021, whether continued withholding from public disclosure of the identified records is warranted after October 26, 2021.</FP>

  <PNOTICE>Notice of May 9, 2018</PNOTICE>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of the Government of Syria</HD>
  <FP>On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibited the exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012.</FP>

  <FP>The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the <PRTPAGE P="939"/>United States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.</FP>
  <FP>The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have been calling for freedom and a representative government, not only endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also generates instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, including with respect to chemical weapons, supporting terrorist organizations, and obstructing the Lebanese government's ability to function effectively, continue to foster the rise of extremism and sectarianism and pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures to deal with that emergency adopted on that date in Executive Order 13338; on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399; on February 13, 2008, in Executive Order 13460; on April 29, 2011, in Executive Order 13572; on May 18, 2011, in Executive Order 13573; on August 17, 2011, in Executive Order 13582; on April 22, 2012, in Executive Order 13606; and on May 1, 2012, in Executive Order 13608, must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria.</FP>
  <FP>In addition, the United States condemns the Assad regime's use of brutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Assad regime to stop its violence against the Syrian people, uphold the Cessation of Hostilities, enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and allow a political transition in Syria that will forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, democracy, opportunity, and justice.</FP>
  <FP>The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Vice President[,] the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Homeland Security[,] the Director of National Intelligence[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs[,] the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[,] the Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism[, and] the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</HD>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> For decades, the United States has effectively reaped the benefits of operating in space to enhance our national security, civil, and commercial sectors. Our society now depends on space technologies and space-based capabilities for communications, navigation, weather forecasting, and much more. Given the significance of space activities, the United States considers the continued unfettered access to and freedom to operate in space of vital interest to advance the security, economic prosperity, and scientific knowledge of the Nation.</FP>
  <FP>Today, space is becoming increasingly congested and contested, and that trend presents challenges for the safety, stability, and sustainability of U.S. space operations. Already, the Department of Defense (DoD) tracks over 20,000 objects in space, and that number will increase dramatically as new, more capable sensors come online and are able to detect smaller objects. DoD publishes a catalog of space objects and makes notifications of potential conjunctions (that is, two or more objects coming together at the same or nearly the same point in time and space). As the number of space objects increases, however, this limited traffic management activity and architecture will become inadequate. At the same time, the contested nature of space is increasing the demand for DoD focus on protecting and defending U.S. space assets and interests.</FP>
  <FP>The future space operating environment will also be shaped by a significant increase in the volume and diversity of commercial activity in space. Emerging commercial ventures such as satellite servicing, debris removal, in-space manufacturing, and tourism, as well as new technologies enabling small satellites and very large constellations of satellites, are increasingly outpacing efforts to develop and implement government policies and processes to address these new activities.</FP>

  <FP>To maintain U.S. leadership in space, we must develop a new approach to space traffic management (STM) that addresses current and future operational risks. This new approach must set priorities for space situational <PRTPAGE P="948"/>awareness (SSA) and STM innovation in science and technology (S&amp;T), incorporate national security considerations, encourage growth of the U.S. commercial space sector, establish an updated STM architecture, and promote space safety standards and best practices across the international community.</FP>
  <FP>The United States recognizes that spaceflight safety is a global challenge and will continue to encourage safe and responsible behavior in space while emphasizing the need for international transparency and STM data sharing. Through this national policy for STM and other national space strategies and policies, the United States will enhance safety and ensure continued leadership, preeminence, and freedom of action in space.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this memorandum, the following definitions shall apply:</FP>
  <P>(a) Space Situational Awareness shall mean the knowledge and characterization of space objects and their operational environment to support safe, stable, and sustainable space activities.</P>
  <P>(b) Space Traffic Management shall mean the planning, coordination, and on-orbit synchronization of activities to enhance the safety, stability, and sustainability of operations in the space environment.</P>
  <P>(c) Orbital debris, or space debris, shall mean any human-made space object orbiting Earth that no longer serves any useful purpose.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Principles.</E> The United States recognizes, and encourages other nations to recognize, the following principles:</FP>
  <P>(a) Safety, stability, and operational sustainability are foundational to space activities, including commercial, civil, and national security activities. It is a shared interest and responsibility of all spacefaring nations to create the conditions for a safe, stable, and operationally sustainable space environment.</P>
  <P>(b) Timely and actionable SSA data and STM services are essential to space activities. Consistent with national security constraints, basic U.S. Government-derived SSA data and basic STM services should be available free of direct user fees.</P>
  <P>(c) Orbital debris presents a growing threat to space operations. Debris mitigation guidelines, standards, and policies should be revised periodically, enforced domestically, and adopted internationally to mitigate the operational effects of orbital debris.</P>
  <P>(d) A STM framework consisting of best practices, technical guidelines, safety standards, behavioral norms, pre-launch risk assessments, and on-orbit collision avoidance services is essential to preserve the space operational environment.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Goals.</E> Consistent with the principles listed in section 3 of this memorandum, the United States should continue to lead the world in creating the conditions for a safe, stable, and operationally sustainable space environment. Toward this end, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall pursue the following goals as required in section 6 of this memorandum:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Advance SSA and STM Science and Technology.</E> The United States should continue to engage in and enable S&amp;T research and development to <PRTPAGE P="949"/>support the practical applications of SSA and STM. These activities include improving fundamental knowledge of the space environment, such as the characterization of small debris, advancing the S&amp;T of critical SSA inputs such as observational data, algorithms, and models necessary to improve SSA capabilities, and developing new hardware and software to support data processing and observations.</P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Mitigate the effect of orbital debris on space activities.</E> The volume and location of orbital debris are growing threats to space activities. It is in the interest of all to minimize new debris and mitigate effects of existing debris. This fact, along with increasing numbers of active satellites, highlights the need to update existing orbital debris mitigation guidelines and practices to enable more efficient and effective compliance, and establish standards that can be adopted internationally. These trends also highlight the need to establish satellite safety design guidelines and best practices.</P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Encourage and facilitate U.S. commercial leadership in S&amp;T, SSA, and STM.</E> Fostering continued growth and innovation in the U.S. commercial space sector, which includes S&amp;T, SSA, and STM activities, is in the national interest of the United States. To achieve this goal, the U.S. Government should streamline processes and reduce regulatory burdens that could inhibit commercial sector growth and innovation, enabling the U.S. commercial sector to continue to lead the world in STM-related technologies, goods, data, and services on the international market.</P>
  <P>(d) <E T="03">Provide U.S. Government-supported basic SSA data and basic STM services to the public.</E> The United States should continue to make available basic SSA data and basic STM services (including conjunction and reentry notifications) free of direct user fees while supporting new opportunities for U.S. commercial and non-profit SSA data and STM services.</P>
  <P>(e) <E T="03">Improve SSA data interoperability and enable greater SSA data sharing.</E> SSA data must be timely and accurate. It is in the national interest of the United States to improve SSA data interoperability and enable greater SSA data sharing among all space operators, consistent with national security constraints. The United States should seek to lead the world in the development of improved SSA data standards and information sharing.</P>
  <P>(f) <E T="03">Develop STM standards and best practices.</E> As the leader in space, the United States supports the development of operational standards and best practices to promote safe and responsible behavior in space. A critical first step in carrying out that goal is to develop U.S.-led minimum safety standards and best practices to coordinate space traffic. U.S. regulatory agencies should, as appropriate, adopt these standards and best practices in domestic regulatory frameworks and use them to inform and help shape international consensus practices and standards.</P>
  <P>(g) <E T="03">Prevent unintentional radio frequency (RF) interference.</E> Growing orbital congestion is increasing the risk to U.S. space assets from unintentional RF interference. The United States should continue to improve policies, processes, and technologies for spectrum use (including allocations and licensing) to address these challenges and ensure appropriate spectrum use for current and future operations.</P>
  <P>(h) <E T="03">Improve the U.S. domestic space object registry.</E> Transparency and data sharing are essential to safe, stable, and sustainable space operations. Consistent with national security constraints, the United States should <PRTPAGE P="950"/>streamline the interagency process to ensure accurate and timely registration submissions to the United Nations (UN), in accordance with our international obligations under the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space.</P>
  <P>(i) <E T="03">Develop policies and regulations for future U.S. orbital operations.</E> Increasing congestion in key orbits and maneuver-based missions such as servicing, survey, and assembly will drive the need for policy development for national security, civil, and commercial sector space activities. Consistent with U.S. law and international obligations, the United States should regularly assess existing guidelines for non-government orbital activities, and maintain a timely and responsive regulatory environment for licensing these activities.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Guidelines.</E> In pursuit of the principles and goals of this policy, agencies should observe the following guidelines:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Managing the Integrity of the Space Operating Environment.</E>
  </P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Improving SSA coverage and accuracy. Timely, accurate, and actionable data are essential for effective SSA and STM. The United States should seek to minimize deficiencies in SSA capability, particularly coverage in regions with limited sensor availability and sensitivity in detection of small debris, through SSA data sharing, the purchase of SSA data, or the provision of new sensors.</FP>
  <FP>New U.S. sensors are expected to reveal a substantially greater volume of debris and improve our understanding of space object size distributions in various regions of space. However, very small debris may not be sufficiently tracked to enable or justify actionable collision avoidance decisions. As a result, close conjunctions and even collisions with unknown objects are possible, and satellite operators often lack sufficient insight to assess their level of risk when making maneuvering decisions. The United States should develop better tracking capabilities, and new means to catalog such debris, and establish a quality threshold for actionable collision avoidance warning to minimize false alarms.</FP>
  <FP>Through both Government and commercial sector S&amp;T investment, the United States should advance concepts and capabilities to improve SSA in support of debris mitigation and collision avoidance decisions.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) Establishing an Open Architecture SSA Data Repository. Accurate and timely tracking of objects orbiting Earth is essential to preserving the safety of space activities for all. Consistent with section 2274 of title 10, United States Code, a basic level of SSA data in the form of the publicly releasable portion of the DoD catalog is and should continue to be provided free of direct user fees. As additional sources of space tracking data become available, the United States has the opportunity to incorporate civil, commercial, international, and other available data to allow users to enhance and refine this service. To facilitate greater data sharing with satellite operators and enable the commercial development of enhanced space safety services, the United States must develop the standards and protocols for creation of an open architecture data repository. The essential features of this repository would include:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Data integrity measures to ensure data accuracy and availability;</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Data standards to ensure sufficient quality from diverse sources;<PRTPAGE P="951"/>
  </FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Measures to safeguard proprietary or sensitive data, including national security information;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• The inclusion of satellite owner-operator ephemerides to inform orbital location and planned maneuvers; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Standardized formats to enable development of applications to leverage the data.</FP>
  <FP>To facilitate this enhanced data sharing, and in recognition of the need for DoD to focus on maintaining access to and freedom of action in space, a civil agency should, consistent with applicable law, be responsible for the publicly releasable portion of the DoD catalog and for administering an open architecture data repository. The Department of Commerce should be that civil agency.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) Mitigating Orbital Debris. It is in the interest of all space operators to minimize the creation of new orbital debris. Rapid international expansion of space operations and greater diversity of missions have rendered the current U.S. Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP) inadequate to control the growth of orbital debris. These standard practices should be updated to address current and future space operating environments. The United States should develop a new protocol of standard practices to set broader expectations of safe space operations in the 21st century. This protocol should begin with updated ODMSP, but also incorporate sections to address operating practices for large constellations, rendezvous and proximity operations, small satellites, and other classes of space operations. These overarching practices will provide an avenue to promote efficient and effective space safety practices with U.S. industry and internationally.</FP>
  <FP>The United States should pursue active debris removal as a necessary long-term approach to ensure the safety of flight operations in key orbital regimes. This effort should not detract from continuing to advance international protocols for debris mitigation associated with current programs.</FP>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Operating in a Congested Space Environment.</E>
  </P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Minimum Safety Standards and Best Practices. The creation of minimum standards for safe operation and debris mitigation derived in part from the U.S. Government ODMSP, but incorporating other standards and best practices, will best ensure the safe operation of U.S. space activities. These safety guidelines should consider maneuverability, tracking, reliability, and disposal.</FP>
  <FP>The United States should eventually incorporate appropriate standards and best practices into Federal law and regulation through appropriate rulemaking or licensing actions. These guidelines should encompass protocols for all stages of satellite operation from design through end-of-life.</FP>
  <FP>Satellite and constellation owners should participate in a pre-launch certification process that should, at a minimum, consider the following factors:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Coordination of orbit utilization to prevent conjunctions;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Constellation owner-operators' management of self-conjunctions;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Owner-operator notification of planned maneuvers and sharing of satellite orbital location data;</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• On-orbit tracking aids, including beacons or sensing enhancements, if such systems are needed;<PRTPAGE P="952"/>
  </FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Encryption of satellite command and control links and data protection measures for ground site operations;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Appropriate minimum reliability based on type of mission and phase of operations;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Effect on the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, or international obligations; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Self-disposal upon the conclusion of operational lifetime, or owner-operator provision for disposal using active debris removal methods.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) On-Orbit Collision Avoidance Support Service. Timely warning of potential collisions is essential to preserving the safety of space activities for all. Basic collision avoidance information services are and should continue to be provided free of direct user fees. The imminent activation of more sensitive tracking sensors is expected to reveal a significantly greater population of the existing orbital debris background as well as provide an improved ability to track currently catalogued objects. Current and future satellites, including large constellations of satellites, will operate in a debris environment much denser than presently tracked. Preventing on-orbit collisions in this environment requires an information service that shares catalog data, predicts close approaches, and provides actionable warnings to satellite operators. The service should provide data to allow operators to assess proposed maneuvers to reduce risk. To provide on-orbit collision avoidance, the United States should:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Provide services based on a continuously updated catalog of satellite tracking data;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Utilize automated processes for collision avoidance;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Provide actionable and timely conjunction assessments; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Provide data to operators to enable assessment of maneuver plans.</FP>
  <FP>To ensure safe coordination of space traffic in this future operating environment, and in recognition of the need for DoD to focus on maintaining access to and freedom of action in space, a civil agency should be the focal point for this collision avoidance support service. The Department of Commerce should be that civil agency.</FP>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Strategies for Space Traffic Management in a Global Context.</E>
  </P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Protocols to Prevent Orbital Conjunctions. As increased satellite operations make lower Earth orbits more congested, the United States should develop a set of standard techniques for mitigating the collision risk of increasingly congested orbits, particularly for large constellations. Appropriate methods, which may include licensing assigned volumes for constellation operation and establishing processes for satellites passing through the volumes, are needed. The United States should explore strategies that will lead to the establishment of common global best practices, including:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• A common process addressing the volume of space used by a large constellation, particularly in close proximity to an existing constellation;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• A common process by which individual spacecraft may transit volumes used by existing satellites or constellations; and</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• A set of best practices for the owner-operators of utilized volumes to minimize the long-term effects of constellation operations on the space <PRTPAGE P="953"/>environment (including the proper disposal of satellites, reliability standards, and effective collision avoidance).</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) Radio Frequency Spectrum and Interference Protection. Space traffic and RF spectrum use have traditionally been independently managed processes. Increased congestion in key orbital regimes creates a need for improved and increasingly dynamic methods to coordinate activities in both the physical and spectral domains, and may introduce new interdependencies. U.S. Government efforts in STM should address the following spectrum management considerations:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Where appropriate, verify consistency between policy and existing national and international regulations and goals regarding global access to, and operation in, the RF spectrum for space services;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Investigate the advantages of addressing spectrum in conjunction with the development of STM systems, standards, and best practices;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Promote flexible spectrum use and investigate emerging technologies for potential use by space systems; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">• Ensure spectrum-dependent STM components, such as inter-satellite safety communications and active debris removal systems, can successfully access the required spectrum necessary to their missions.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) Global Engagement. In its role as a major spacefaring nation, the United States should continue to develop and promote a range of norms of behavior, best practices, and standards for safe operations in space to minimize the space debris environment and promote data sharing and coordination of space activities. It is essential that other spacefaring nations also adopt best practices for the common good of all spacefaring states. The United States should encourage the adoption of new norms of behavior and best practices for space operations by the international community through bilateral and multilateral discussions with other spacefaring nations, and through U.S. participation in various organizations such as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee, International Standards Organization, Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, and UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea</HD>

  <FP>On June 26, 2008, by Executive Order 13466, the President declared a national emergency with respect to North Korea pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President <PRTPAGE P="956"/>also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea.</FP>

  <FP>On August 30, 2010, the President signed Executive Order 13551, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship <E T="03">Cheonan</E> and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, including the procurement of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in international markets through which it obtains financial and other support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, which destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil United States Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region.</FP>

  <FP>On April 18, 2011, the President signed Executive Order 13570 to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 and expanded in Executive Order 13551 that would ensure the implementation of the import restrictions contained in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import restrictions provided for in the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</FP>
  <FP>On January 2, 2015, the President signed Executive Order 13687 to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, expanded in Executive Order 13551, and addressed further in Executive Order 13570, to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses.</FP>
  <FP>On March 15, 2016, the President signed Executive Order 13722 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced by its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, that increasingly imperils the United States and its allies.</FP>

  <FP>On September 20, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13810 to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the provocative, destabilizing, and <PRTPAGE P="957"/>repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missile launches of July 3 and July 28, 2017, and its nuclear test of September 2, 2017; its commission of serious human rights abuses; and its use of funds generated through international trade to support its nuclear and missile programs and weapons proliferation.</FP>
  <FP>The existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551, addressed further in Executive Order 13570, further expanded in scope in Executive Order 13687, and under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13722 and Executive Order 13810, and the measures taken to deal with that national emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to North Korea declared in Executive Order 13466.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western Balkans</HD>
  <FP>On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. The President subsequently amended that order in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003, to take additional steps with respect to acts obstructing implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 relating to Macedonia.</FP>

  <FP>The actions of persons threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans, including acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations</HD>
  <FP>On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations.</FP>
  <FP>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Such organizations are increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons.</FP>
  <FP>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

  <FP>On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Lebanon pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of certain persons to undermine Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic institutions; to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian interference in Lebanon; or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese sovereignty. Such actions contribute to political and economic instability in that country and the region.</FP>

  <FP>Certain ongoing activities, such as Iran's continuing arms transfers to Hizballah—which include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems—serve to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and economic instability in the region, and continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on August <PRTPAGE P="960"/>1, 2007, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2018.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the Secretary of Homeland Security[,] the Postmaster General[, and] the Chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission</HD>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:<PRTPAGE P="961"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
    <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (a) “Good” means any tangible and movable object that can be conveyed by the international postal system, excluding (i) written, drawn, printed, or digital information recorded on a tangible medium that is not an object of merchandise and (ii) money.</FP>
  <P>(b) “Non-postal operator” means a private express carrier, freight forwarder, or other provider of services for the collection, transportation, and delivery of international documents and packages, other than a postal operator.</P>
  <P>(c) “Postal operator” means a governmental or non-governmental entity officially designated by a Universal Postal Union (UPU) member country to operate postal services and to fulfill the related obligations arising out of the Acts of the UPU on its territory.</P>
  <P>(d) “Terminal dues” means the rates or fees determined through the UPU and paid by the postal operator in the country of origin to the postal operator in the country of destination to compensate for costs incurred in the country of destination for processing, transportation, and delivery of international “letter post” items, which may include documents or goods and generally weigh up to 4.4 pounds.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E>
    <E T="03">Policy.</E> (a) The UPU was established in 1874 by 21 countries. The United States played an integral role in the UPU's creation and, since that time, the United States has actively participated in all phases of the UPU's work. The United States is a party to the current Constitution of the UPU—which was adopted in 1964—and intends to continue to participate fully in and financially contribute to the UPU, as provided in Article 21 of the UPU Constitution. As a member country of the UPU, the United States recognizes the importance of this long-standing organization and is proud of the United States' unbroken record of participation in it.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress has provided that the Secretary of State (Secretary), in concluding postal treaties, conventions, or other international agreements, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, take measures to encourage governments of other countries to make available to the United States Postal Service (USPS) and private companies a range of nondiscriminatory customs procedures that will fully meet the needs of all types of American shippers (39 U.S.C. 407(e)(3)).</FP>
  <FP>The Congress has likewise directed that responsible officials shall apply the customs laws of the United States and all other laws relating to importation or exportation of goods in the same manner to shipments of goods that are competitive products of the USPS and to similar shipments by private companies (39 U.S.C. 407(e)(2)).</FP>
  <FP>It is the policy of the United States to promote and encourage the development of an efficient and competitive global system that provides for fair and nondiscriminatory postal rates.</FP>
  <P>(b) It is in the interest of the United States to:</P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) promote and encourage communications between peoples by efficient operation of international postal services and other international delivery services for cultural, social, and economic purposes (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(1));<PRTPAGE P="962"/>
  </FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) promote and encourage unrestricted and undistorted competition in the provision of international postal services and other international delivery services, except where provision of such services by private companies may be prohibited by the laws of the United States (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(2));</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) promote and encourage a clear distinction between governmental and operational responsibilities with respect to the provision of international postal services and other international delivery services by the Government of the United States and by intergovernmental organizations of which the United States is a member (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(3)); and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) participate in multilateral and bilateral agreements with other countries to accomplish these objectives (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(4)).</FP>
  <P>(c) Some current international postal practices in the UPU do not align with United States economic and national security interests:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) UPU terminal dues, in many cases, are less than comparable domestic postage rates. As a result:</FP>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(A) the United States, along with other member countries of the UPU, is in many cases not fully reimbursed by the foreign postal operator for the cost of delivering foreign-origin letter post items, which can result in substantial preferences for foreign mailers relative to domestic mailers;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(B) the current terminal dues rates undermine the goal of unrestricted and undistorted competition in cross-border delivery services because they disadvantage non-postal operators seeking to offer competing collection and outward transportation services for goods covered by terminal dues in foreign markets; and</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(C) the current system of terminal dues distorts the flow of small packages around the world by incentivizing the shipping of goods from foreign countries that benefit from artificially low reimbursement rates.</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) The UPU has not done enough to reorient international mail to achieve a clear distinction between documents and goods. Without such a distinction, it is difficult to achieve essential pricing reforms or to ensure that customs requirements, including provision of electronic customs data for goods, are met. Under the current system, foreign postal operators do not uniformly furnish advance electronic customs data that are needed to enhance targeting and risk management for national security and to facilitate importation and customs clearance. My Administration's Initiative to Stop Opioids Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand, launched in March of this year, requires accurate advance electronic customs data for 90 percent of all international mail shipments that contain goods and consignment shipments within 3 years, so that the Department of Homeland Security can better detect and flag high-risk shipments.</FP>
  <P>(d) It shall be the policy of the executive branch to support efforts that further the policies in this memorandum, including supporting a system of unrestricted and undistorted competition between United States and foreign merchants. Such efforts include:</P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) ensuring that rates charged for delivery of foreign-origin mail containing goods do not favor foreign mailers over domestic mailers;<PRTPAGE P="963"/>
  </FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) setting rates charged for delivery of foreign- origin mail in a manner that does not favor postal operators over non-postal operators; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) ensuring the collection of advance electronic customs data.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3.</E>
    <E T="03">Relations with the UPU.</E> (a) The United States must seek reforms to the UPU that promote the policies outlined in this memorandum. Such reforms shall provide for:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) a system of fair and nondiscriminatory rates for goods that promotes unrestricted and undistorted competition; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) terminal dues rates that:</FP>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(A) fully reimburse the USPS for costs to the same extent as domestic rates for comparable services;</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(B) avoid a preference for inbound foreign small packages containing goods that favors foreign mailers over domestic mailers; and</P>
  <P SOURCE="P1">(C) avoid a preference for inbound foreign small packages containing goods that favors postal operators over private-sector entities providing transportation services.</P>
  <P>(b) If negotiations at the UPU's September 2018 Second Extraordinary Congress in Ethiopia fail to yield reforms that satisfy the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the United States will consider taking any appropriate actions to ensure that rates for the delivery of inbound foreign packages satisfy those criteria, consistent with applicable law.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E>
    <E T="03">Actions by the Secretary.</E> (a) The Secretary shall notify the Director General of the UPU of the policies and intentions of the United States described in this memorandum.</FP>
  <P>(b) The Secretary or his designee shall, consistent with 39 U.S.C. 407(b)(1), seek agreement on future Convention texts that comport with the policies of this memorandum in meetings of the UPU, including at the September 2018 Extraordinary Congress.</P>
  <P>(c) No later than November 1, 2018, the Secretary shall submit to the President a report summarizing the steps being taken to implement this memorandum. If the Secretary determines that sufficient progress on reforms to promote compatibility of the Acts of the UPU with the policy of this memorandum is not being achieved, the Secretary shall include recommendations for future action, including the possibility of adopting self-declared rates.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5.</E>
    <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2019</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of State</HD>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, <PRTPAGE P="967"/>Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.</FP>
  <FP>A country's presence on the foregoing list is not necessarily a reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 48l(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), the reason countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control measures.</FP>
  <FP>Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take the measures required by section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Included with this determination are justifications for these designations, as required by section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA. I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid the promotion of democracy in Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>Combatting the ongoing United States opioid epidemic is one of my Administration's most urgent priorities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which I signed into law this spring, dedicated nearly $4 billion in additional funding to confront this national crisis. My Administration is committed to addressing all factors fueling this drug crisis, which is devastating communities across America, including steps to curb over-prescription, expand access to treatment and recovery programs, improve public education programs to prevent illicit drug use before it begins, and to strengthening domestic drug enforcement at our borders and throughout our Nation. Alongside these massive and historic United States efforts, I expect the governments of countries where illicit drugs originate and through which they transit to similarly strengthen their commitments to reduce dangerous drug production and trafficking.</FP>

  <FP>In this respect, I am deeply concerned that illicit drug crops have expanded over successive years in Colombia, Mexico, and Afghanistan, and are now at record levels. Drug production and trafficking in these three countries directly affect United States national interests and the health and safety of American citizens. Heroin originating from Mexico and cocaine from Colombia are claiming thousands of lives annually in the United States. Afghanistan's illicit opium economy promotes corruption, funds the Taliban, and undermines that country's security, which thousands of United States service men and women help defend. Despite the efforts of law enforcement and security forces, these countries are falling behind in the fight to eradicate illicit crops and reduce drug production and trafficking. These governments must redouble their efforts to rise to the challenge posed by the criminal organizations producing and trafficking these drugs, and achieve greater progress over the coming year in stopping and reversing illicit drug production and trafficking. The United States will continue its strong support for international efforts against drug production and trafficking, as well as to strengthen prevention and treatment efforts in the <PRTPAGE P="968"/>United States. The urgency of our national drug epidemic requires significant and measurable results immediately, in the coming year and in the future.</FP>

  <FP>You are authorized and directed to submit this designation, with the Bolivia and Venezuela memoranda of justification, under section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and publish it in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>DONALD J. TRUMPTHE WHITE HOUSE,</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Energy[,] the Secretary of the Army[, and] the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> During the 20th Century, the Federal Government invested enormous resources in water infrastructure throughout the western United States to reduce flood risks to communities; to provide reliable water supplies for farms, families, businesses, and fish and wildlife; and to generate dependable hydropower. Decades of uncoordinated, piecemeal regulatory actions have diminished the ability of our Federal infrastructure, however, to deliver water and power in an efficient, cost-effective way.</FP>
  <FP>Unless addressed, fragmented regulation of water infrastructure will continue to produce inefficiencies, unnecessary burdens, and conflict among the Federal Government, States, tribes, and local public agencies that deliver water to their citizenry. To meet these challenges, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce should, to the extent permitted by law, work together to minimize unnecessary regulatory burdens and foster more efficient decision-making so that water projects are better able to meet the demands of their authorized purposes.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Streamlining Western Water Infrastructure Regulatory Processes and Removing Unnecessary Burdens.</E> To address water infrastructure challenges in the western United States, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall undertake the following actions:</FP>
  <P>(a) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall:</P>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) identify major water infrastructure projects in California for which the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce have joint <PRTPAGE P="974"/>responsibility under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (Public Law 93-205) or individual responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (Public Law 91-190); and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) for each such project, work together to facilitate the designation of one official to coordinate the agencies' ESA and NEPA compliance responsibilities. Within the 30-day time period provided by this subsection, the designated official shall also identify regulations and procedures that potentially burden the project and develop a proposed plan, for consideration by the Secretaries, to appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind any regulations or procedures that unduly burden the project beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. For purposes of this memorandum, “burden” means to unnecessarily obstruct, delay, curtail, impede, or otherwise impose significant costs on the permitting, utilization, transmission, delivery, or supply of water resources and infrastructure.</FP>
  <P>(b) Within 40 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall develop a timeline for completing applicable environmental compliance requirements for projects identified under section 2(a)(i) of this memorandum. Environmental compliance requirements shall be completed as expeditiously as possible, and in accordance with applicable law.</P>
  <P>(c) To the maximum extent practicable and consistent with applicable law, including the authorities granted to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (Public Law 114-322):</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the ongoing review of the long-term coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project is completed and an updated Plan of Operations and Record of Decision is issued.</FP>

To the extent practicable and consistent with law, these shall be joint opinions.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall complete the joint consultation presently underway for the Klamath Irrigation Project by August 2019.</FP>
  <P>(d) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall provide monthly updates to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and other components of the Executive Office of the President, as appropriate, regarding progress in meeting the established timelines.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Improve Forecasts of Water Availability.</E> To facilitate greater use of forecast-based management and use of authorities and capabilities provided by the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-25) and other applicable laws, the Secretary of the Interior and <PRTPAGE P="975"/>the Secretary of Commerce shall convene water experts and resource managers to develop an action plan to improve the information and modeling capabilities related to water availability and water infrastructure projects. The action plan shall be completed by January 2019 and submitted to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Improving Use of Technology to Increase Water Reliability.</E> To the maximum extent practicable, and pursuant to the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act (Public Law 102-575, title XVI), the Water Desalination Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-298), and other applicable laws, the Secretary of the Interior shall direct appropriate bureaus to promote the expanded use of technology for improving the accuracy and reliability of water and power deliveries. This promotion of expanded use should include:</FP>

  <P>(c) investment in programs that promote and encourage innovation, research, and development of technology that improve water management, using best available science through real-time monitoring of wildlife and water deliveries.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Consideration of Locally Developed Plans in Hydroelectric Projects Licensing.</E> To the extent the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce participate in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensing activities for hydroelectric projects, and to the extent permitted by law, the Secretaries shall give appropriate consideration to any relevant information available to them in locally developed plans, where consistent with the best available information.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Developing a Sustainable Spectrum Strategy for America's Future</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
    <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the United States to use radiofrequency spectrum (spectrum) as efficiently and effectively as possible to help meet our economic, national security, science, safety, and other Federal mission goals now and in the future. To best achieve this policy, the Nation requires a balanced, forward-looking, flexible, and sustainable approach to spectrum management.</FP>
  <FP>The growth in the availability of mobile wireless broadband connectivity over the past decade has reshaped the American experience—the way Americans work, learn, shop, run businesses, transport their families and goods across the Nation, farm, conduct financial transactions, consume entertainment, deliver and receive public safety services, and interact with one another. In the growing digital economy, wireless technologies expand opportunities to increase economic output of rural communities and connect them with urban markets, and offer safety benefits that save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce the cost of transportation incidents. American companies and institutions rely heavily on high-speed wireless connections, with increasing demands on both speed and capacity. Wireless technologies are helping to bring broadband to rural, unserved, and underserved parts of America. Spectrum-dependent systems also are indispensable to the performance of many important United States Government missions. And as a Nation, our dependence on these airwaves is likely to continue to grow.</FP>
  <FP>As the National Security Strategy of 2017 made clear, access to spectrum is a critical component of the technological capabilities that enable economic activity and protect national security. Wireless communications and associated data applications establish a foundation for high-wage jobs and national prosperity. While American industry continues to extract greater and greater value from spectrum, each technological leap also increases demands on its usage. Those demands have never been greater than today, with the advent of autonomous vehicles and precision agriculture, the expansion of commercial space operations, and the burgeoning Internet of Things signaling a nearly insatiable demand for spectrum access. Moreover, it is imperative that America be first in fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies—wireless technologies capable of meeting the high-capacity, low-latency, and high-speed requirements that can unleash innovation broadly across diverse sectors of the economy and the public sector. Flexible, predictable spectrum access by the United States Government will help ensure that Federal users can meet current and future mission requirements for a broad range of both communications- and non-communications-based systems.</FP>

  <FP>The Nation can and will ensure security and safety through modern technology. America's national security depends on technological excellence and the United States Government must continue to have access to the <PRTPAGE P="978"/>spectrum resources needed to serve the national interest, from protecting the homeland and managing the national airspace, to forecasting severe weather and exploring the frontiers of space. Technological innovation in spectrum usage, moreover, occurs in both the private and public sectors. Federal agencies must thoughtfully consider whether and how their spectrum-dependent mission needs might be met more efficiently and effectively, including through new technology and ingenuity. The United States Government shall continue to look for additional opportunities to share spectrum among Federal and non-Federal entities. The United States Government shall also continue to encourage investment and adoption by Federal agencies of commercial, dual-use, or other advanced technologies that meet mission requirements, including 5G technologies. In doing so, we will take appropriate measures to sustain the radiofrequency environment in which critical United States infrastructure and space systems operate.</FP>

  <PNOTICE>Notice of October 31, 2018</PNOTICE>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan</HD>
  <FP>On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Sudan pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and took related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, by Executive Order 13400, the President determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, and ordered the blocking of property of certain persons connected to the Darfur region. On October 13, 2006, by Executive Order 13412, the President took additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 and expanded in Executive Order 13400. In Executive Order 13412, the President also took steps to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).</FP>

  <FP>On January 13, 2017, by Executive Order 13761, the President found that positive efforts by the Government of Sudan between July 2016 and January 2017 improved certain conditions that Executive Orders 13067 and 13412 were intended to address. Given these developments, and in order to encourage the Government of Sudan to sustain and enhance these efforts, section 1 of Executive Order 13761 provided that sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 would be revoked as of July 12, 2017, provided that the criteria in section 12(b) of Executive Order 13761 had been met.<PRTPAGE P="984"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>On July 11, 2017, by Executive Order 13804, I amended Executive Order 13761, extending until October 12, 2017, the effective date in section 1 of Executive Order 13761. On October 12, 2017, pursuant to Executive Order 13761, as amended by Executive Order 13804, sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 were revoked.</FP>
  <FP>Despite recent positive developments, the crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997; the expansion of that emergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006; and with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 2017, and Executive Order 13804 of July 11, 2017, has not been resolved. These actions and policies continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I have, therefore, determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, as expanded by Executive Order 13400, with respect to Sudan.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction</HD>
  <FP>On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such weapons. On July 28, 1998, by Executive Order 13094, the President amended Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the worldwide threat of proliferation activities related to weapons of mass destruction. On June 28, 2005, by Executive Order 13382, the President, among other things, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our ability to combat proliferation activities related to weapons of mass destruction. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such weapons must continue beyond November 14, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended by Executive Orders 13094 and 13382.</FP>

  <FP>Our relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is ongoing. For this reason, the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am <PRTPAGE P="986"/>continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12170.</FP>
  <FP>The emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 is distinct from the emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 on March 15, 1995. This renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of March 12, 2018.</FP>

  <FP>On December 20, 2017, by Executive Order 13818, the President declared a national emergency with respect to serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world and, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), took related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on December 20, 2017, must continue in effect beyond December 20, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 with respect to serious human rights abuse and corruption.</FP>

        <P>(vi) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.</P>
        <P>(2) The agency may not deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or activities.</P>

        <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 102.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
      </SECTION>
      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 102.150</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
        <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
        <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

        <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 102.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result <PRTPAGE P="1001"/>in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
        <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
        <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
        <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
        <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
        <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
        <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

        <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

        <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
        <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
        <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
        <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
        <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
        <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
        <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
        <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 102.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

        <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers <PRTPAGE P="1003"/>Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.</P>
        <P>(g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—</P>
