      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2018), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Off-limits establishments and areas.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The establishment of off-limits areas is a function of Command. It may be used by commanders to help maintain good order and discipline, health, morale, safety, and welfare of service members. Off-limits action is also intended to prevent service members from being exposed to or victimized by crime-conducive conditions. Where sufficient cause exists, commanders retain substantial discretion to declare establishments or areas temporarily off-limits to personnel of their respective commands in emergency situations. Temporary off-limits restrictions issued by commanders in an emergency situation will be acted upon by the AFDCB as a first priority. As a matter of policy, a change in ownership, management, or name of any off-limits establishment does not, in and of itself, revoke the off-limits restriction.</P>

                <P>(b) Service members are prohibited from entering establishments or areas declared off-limits according to this part. Violations may subject the member to disciplinary action per applicable Service parts, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Family members of service members and others associated with the Service or installation should be made aware of <PRTPAGE P="10"/>off-limits restrictions. As a general policy, these establishments will not be visited by Service law enforcement personnel unless specifically determined by the installation commander that visits or surveillance are warranted.</P>
                <P>(c) Prior to initiating AFDCB action, installation commanders will attempt to correct adverse conditions or situations through the assistance of civic leaders or officials.</P>
                <P>(d) Prior to recommending an off-limits restriction, the AFDCB will send a written notice (certified mail-return receipt requested) to the individual or firm responsible for the alleged condition or situation. The AFDCB will specify in the notice a reasonable time for the condition or situation to be corrected, along with the opportunity to present any relevant information to the board. If subsequent investigation reveals that the responsible person has failed to take corrective action, the board will recommend the imposition of the off-limits restriction.</P>
                <P>(e) A specified time limit will not be established when an off-limits restriction is invoked. The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the responsible individual will be the determining factor in removing an off-limits restriction.</P>
                <P>(f) A person whose establishment or area has been declared off-limits may at any time petition the president of the board to remove the off-limits restriction. The petition will be in writing and will include a detailed report of action taken to eliminate the condition or situation that caused imposition of the restriction. The president of the AFDCB may direct an investigation to determine the status of corrective actions noted in the petition. The board will either recommend removal or continuation of the off-limits restriction to the local sponsoring commander based on the results of the investigation.</P>
                <P>(g) Off-limits procedures to be followed by the boards are in appendix A of this part. In the United States, off-limits signs will not be posted on civilian establishments by U.S. military authorities.</P>
                <P>(h) In areas Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS), off-limits and other AFDCB procedures must be consistent with existing Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs).</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 631—Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board Procedures Guide</HD>
                <P>A-1. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This guide prescribes procedures for the establishment, operation, and coordination of AFDCBs. AFDCB proceedings are not adversarial in nature.</P>
                <P>A-2. <E T="03">Meetings.</E>
                </P>
                <P>a. The board will meet quarterly. The commander establishing the AFDCB may specify whether the meetings will be open or closed. If not specified, the decision is at the discretion of the president of the board. Normally proceedings are closed, but may be opened to the public when circumstances warrant.</P>
                <P>b. Special meetings may be called by the president of the board. Except by unanimous consent of members present, final action will be taken only on the business for which the meeting was called.</P>
                <P>c. A majority of voting members constitutes a quorum for board proceedings.</P>
                <P>A-3. <E T="03">AFDCB composition.</E> Voting members will be selected per section 631.7.</P>
                <P>A-4. <E T="03">Attendance of observers or witnesses.</E>
                </P>
                <P>a. The board may invite individual persons or organization representatives as witnesses or observers if they are necessary or appropriate for the conduct of board proceedings. The below listed authorities may assist in addressing installation or command concerns or issues.</P>
                <P>(1) Federal, State, and local judicial, legislative, and law enforcement officials.</P>
                <P>(2) Housing part and enforcement authorities.</P>
                <P>(3) Health, and social service authorities.</P>
                <P>(4) Environmental protection authorities.</P>
                <P>(5) Alcoholic beverage control authorities.</P>

                <P>(9) Public works or utility authorities.</P>
                <P>(10) Local fire marshal, and public safety authorities.</P>
                <P>(11) State and local school board or education officials.</P>
                <P>(12) Any other representation deemed appropriate by the sponsoring command such as, news media, union representatives, and so forth.</P>
                <P>b. Invited witnesses and observers will be listed in the minutes of the meeting.</P>
                <P>A-5. <E T="03">Appropriate areas for board consideration.</E>
                </P>
                <P>a. Boards will study and take appropriate action on all reports of conditions considered detrimental to the good order and discipline, health, morale, welfare, safety, and morals of Armed Forces personnel. These adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, those identified in § 631.9.</P>
                <P>b. The board will immediately forward to the local commander reported circumstances involving discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, age, or national origin.</P>
                <P>A-6. <E T="03">Off-limit procedures.</E>
                </P>

                <P>a. Off-limits restrictions should be invoked only when there is substantive information indicating that an establishment or area frequented by Armed Forces personnel presents conditions, which adversely affect their health, safety, welfare, morale, or morals. It is essential that boards do not act arbitrarily. Actions must not be of a punitive nature. Boards should work in close cooperation with local officials and proprietors of business establishments, and seek to accomplish their mission through mutually cooperative efforts. Boards should encourage personal visits by local military, and civilian enforcement or health officials to establishments considered below standard. AFDCBs should point out unhealthy conditions or undesirable practices to establishment owners or operators to produce the desired corrective action.<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
                </P>
                <P>b. In cases involving discrimination, the board should not rely solely on letters written by the Equal Opportunity Office, and Military Affairs Committee or investigations of alleged racial discrimination.</P>
                <P>c. If the board decides to attempt to investigate or inspect an establishment, the president or a designee will prepare, and submit a report of findings, and recommendations at the next meeting. This procedure will ensure complete, and documented information concerning questionable adverse conditions.</P>
                <P>d. When the board concludes that conditions adverse to Armed Forces personnel do exist, the owner or manager will be sent a letter of notification (Annex A). This letter will advise him or her to raise standards by a specified date, and, if such conditions or practices continue, off-limits proceedings will be initiated. Any correspondence with the individuals responsible for adverse conditions, which may lead to off-limits action, will be by certified mail.</P>
                <P>e. If a proprietor takes remedial action to correct undesirable conditions previously noted the board should send a letter of appreciation (Annex B) recognizing this cooperation.</P>
                <P>f. If undesirable conditions are not corrected, the proprietor will be invited to appear before the AFDCB to explain why the establishment should not be placed off-limits (Annex C). Any proprietor may designate in writing a representative to appear before the board in his or her behalf.</P>
                <P>g. In cases where proprietors have been invited to appear before the board, the president of the board will perform the following—</P>
                <P>(1) Prior to calling the proprietor—</P>
                <P>(a) Review the findings and decision of the previous meeting.</P>
                <P>(b) Call for inspection reports.</P>
                <P>(c) Allow those present to ask questions, and discuss the case.</P>
                <P>(2) When the proprietor or his or her representative is called before the board—</P>
                <P>(a) Present the proprietor with a brief summary of the complaint concerning the establishment.</P>
                <P>(b) Afford the proprietor an opportunity to present matters in defense.</P>
                <P>(c) Invite those present to question the proprietor. After the questioning period, provide the proprietor an opportunity to make a final statement before being dismissed.</P>
                <P>(3) Deliberations on recommended actions will be in closed session, attended only by board members.</P>
                <P>h. The board should recommend an off-limits restriction only after the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The letter of notification (Annex A) has been sent.</P>
                <P>(2) An opportunity for the proprietor to appear before the board has been extended.</P>
                <P>(3) Further investigation indicates that improvements have not been made.</P>
                <P>i. The minutes will indicate the AFDCB's action in each case. When a recommendation is made to place an establishment off-limits, the minutes will show the procedural steps followed in reaching the decision.</P>
                <P>j. Recommendations of the AFDCB will be submitted to the sponsoring commander for consideration. The recommendations will then be forwarded to other installation commanders who are represented on the board (Annex D). If no objection to the recommendations is received within 10 days, the sponsoring commander will approve or disapprove the recommendations and forward the decision to the AFDCB president.</P>
                <P>k. Upon approval of the AFDCB's recommendations, the president will write the proprietor that the off-limits restriction has been imposed (Annex E).</P>
                <P>l. A time limit should not be specified when an off-limits restriction is revoked. The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the proprietor of the establishment must be the determining factor in removing the off-limits restriction.</P>
                <P>m. Military authorities may not post off-limits signs or notices on private property.</P>
                <P>n. In emergencies, commanders may temporarily declare establishments or areas off-limits to service members subject to their jurisdiction. The circumstances for the action will be reported as soon as possible to the commander sponsoring the board. Detailed justification for this emergency action will be provided to the board for its deliberations.</P>
                <P>o. Appropriate installation commanders will publish a list of off-limits establishments and areas using command and media channels.</P>
                <P>A-7. <E T="03">Removal of off-limits restrictions.</E>
                </P>
                <P>a. Removal of an off-limits restriction requires AFDCB action. Proprietors of establishments declared off-limits should be advised that they may appeal to the appropriate AFDCB at any time. In their appeal they should submit the reason why the restriction should be removed. A letter of notification for continuance of the off-limits restriction should be sent to the proprietor if the AFDCB does not remove the off-limits restriction (Annex F). The proprietor may appeal to the next higher commander if not satisfied with continuance after exhausting all appeals at the local sponsoring commander level. Boards should make at least quarterly inspections of off-limits establishments. A statement that an inspection has been completed should be included in AFDCB minutes.</P>
                <P>b. When the board learns that the proprietor has taken adequate corrective measures, the AFDCB will take the following actions:</P>

                <P>(1) Discuss the matter at the next meeting and make an appropriate recommendation.<PRTPAGE P="15"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Forward a recommendation for removal of the off-limits restriction to the sponsoring commander. If approved, a letter removing the restriction (Annexes G &amp; H) will be sent to the proprietor.</P>
                <P>(3) The minutes will reflect action taken.</P>
                <P>A-8. <E T="03">Duties of the AFDCB president.</E>
                </P>
                <P>The president of the AFDCB will—</P>
                <P>a. Schedule and preside at all AFDCB meetings.</P>
                <P>b. Provide an agenda to each voting member at least 72 hours prior to the meeting.</P>
                <P>c. Ensure records, minutes, and correspondence are prepared, distributed, and maintained per § 631.10(d).</P>
                <P>A-9. <E T="03">Commanders.</E>
                </P>
                <P>The installation commander, and commanders within an AFDCB's area of responsibility must be thoroughly acquainted with the mission and services provided by AFDCBs. AFDCB members should keep their respective commanders informed of command responsibilities pertaining to AFDCB functions and actions.</P>
                <P>A-10. <E T="03">Public affairs.</E>
                </P>
                <P>a. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, there will not be a media release in connection with AFDCB meetings. However, any AFDCB proceeding, which is open to the public, will also be open to representatives of the news media. Representatives of the news media will be considered observers, and will not participate in matters considered by the AFDCB. Members of the news media may be invited to participate in an advisory status in coordination with the public affairs office.</P>
                <P>b. News media interviews and releases will be handled through the public affairs office according to applicable Service parts.</P>
                <P>A-11. <E T="03">Minutes.</E>
                </P>
                <P>a. Minutes will be prepared in accordance with administrative formats for minutes of meetings prescribed by the Service of the sponsoring commander (Annex I). The written minutes of AFDCB meetings will constitute the official record of the AFDCB proceedings. Verbatim transcripts of board meetings are not required. The reasons for approving or removing an off-limits restriction, to include a complete address of the establishment or area involved, should be indicated in the order of business. In addition, the AFDCB's action will be shown in the order or sequence of actions taken. A change in the name of an establishment or areas in an off-limits restriction will also be included.</P>
                <P>b. Distribution of the minutes of AFDCB meetings will be limited to the following—</P>
                <P>(1) Each voting member, sponsoring command, and commands and installations represented by the board.</P>
                <P>(2) Each civilian and military advisory member, if deemed appropriate.</P>
                <P>(3) Civilian and Government agencies within the State in which member installations are located having an interest in the functions of the board, if appropriate.</P>

                <P>d. Minutes and recommendations of the board will be forwarded to the sponsoring commander for approval.</P>

Requests for amendment will be considered only under the provisions of <PRTPAGE P="18"/>this regulation. Requests to amend USACIDC reports will be granted only if the individual submits new, relevant and material facts that are determined to warrant their inclusion in or revision of the ROI. The burden of proof is on the individual to substantiate the request. Requests to delete a person's name from the title block will be granted only if it is determined that there is not probable cause to believe that the individual committed the offense for which he or she is listed as a subject. It is emphasized that the decision to list a person's name in the title block of a USACIDC report of investigation is an investigative determination that is independent of whether or not subsequent judicial, nonjudicial or administrative action is taken against the individual. Within these parameters, any changes in the ROI rest within the sole discretion of the Commanding General. USACIDC, whose decision will constitute final action on behalf of the Secretary of the Army with respect to this regulation.</P>

Suspension is authorized for non-DOD affiliated civilians only with respect to incidents occurring on the installation or in areas subject to military traffic supervision. After a review of available information as specified in § 634.11, installation driving privileges will be immediately suspended pending resolution of the intoxicated driving accident in the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(i) Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine contents of blood for alcohol or other drugs.</P>
                <P>(ii) Operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .08 percent by volume (.08 grams per 100 milliliters) or higher or in violation of the law of the jurisdiction that is being assimilated on the military installation.</P>
                <P>(iii) Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.05 percent by volume but less than 0.08 percent blood alcohol by volume in violation of the law of the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is being operated if the jurisdiction imposes a suspension solely on the basis of the BAC level (as measured in grams per 100 milliliters).</P>
                <P>(iv) On an arrest report or other official documentation of the circumstances of an apprehension for intoxicated driving.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Revocation.</E> (1) The revocation of installation or overseas command POV driving privileges is a severe administrative measure to be exercised for serious moving violations or when other available corrective actions fail to produce the desired driver improvement. Revocation of the driving privilege will be for a specified period, but never less than 6 months, applies at all military installations, and remains in effect upon reassignment.</P>
                <P>(2) Driving privileges are subject to revocation when an individual fails to comply with any of the conditions requisite to the granting privilege (see § 634.6). Revocation of installation driving and registration privileges is authorized for military personnel, family members, civilian employees of DOD, contractors, and other individuals with installation driving privileges. For civilian guests, revocation is authorized only with respect to incidents occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to military traffic supervision.</P>

                <P>(3) Driving privileges will be revoked for a mandatory period of not less than 1 year in the following circumstances:<PRTPAGE P="24"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The installation commander or designee has determined that the person lawfully apprehended for driving under the influence refused to submit to or complete a test to measure the alcohol content in the blood, or detect the presence of any other drug, as required by the law of the jurisdiction, or installation traffic code, or by Service directive.</P>
                <P>(ii) A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action resulting in the suspension or revocation of driver's license for intoxicated driving. Appropriate official documentation of such conviction is required as the basis for revocation.</P>
                <P>(4) When temporary suspensions under paragraph (a)(3) of this section are followed by revocations, the period of revocation is computed beginning from the date the original suspension was imposed, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges may have been restored pending resolution of charges. (Example: privileges were initially suspended on January 1, 2000 for a charge of intoxicated driving with a BAC of 0.14 percent. A hearing was held, extreme family hardship was substantiated, and privileges were restored on February 1 pending resolution of the charge. On March 1, 2000, the driver was convicted for intoxicated driving. The mandatory 1-year revocation period will consist of January 2000 plus March 2000 through January 2001, for a total of 12 months with no installation driving privileges).</P>
                <P>(c) Army provost marshals will use the automated VRS to develop and maintain records showing that an individual's driving privileges have been revoked.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Remedial driver training programs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Navy activities will comply with OPNAVINST 5100.12 Series, and Marine Corps activities with current edition of MCO 5100.19C for establishment of remedial training programs.</P>
                <P>(b) Installation commanders may establish a remedial driver-training program to instruct and educate personnel requiring additional training. Personnel may be referred to a remedial program on the basis of their individual driving history or incidents requiring additional training. The curriculum should provide instruction to improve driving performance and compliance with traffic laws.</P>
                <P>(c) Installation commanders may schedule periodic courses, or if not practical, arrange for participation in courses conducted by local civil authorities.</P>
                <P>(d) Civilian personnel employed on the installation, contractor employees, and family members of military personnel may attend remedial courses on the installation, or similar courses off the installation which incur no expense to the government.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Administrative due process for suspensions and revocations.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Individual Services will promulgate separate regulations establishing administrative due process procedures for suspension or revocation of driving privileges. The procedures in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to actions taken by Army commanders with respect to Army military personnel and family members and to civilian personnel operating motor vehicles on Army installations. For Marine Corps users, the provisions of this section apply. For Air Force users, a preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period, which is determined by the installation commander.</P>
                <P>(b) For offenses other than intoxicated driving, suspension or revocation of the installation driving privilege will not become effective until the installation commander or designee notifies the affected person and offers that person an administrative hearing. Suspension or revocation will take place 14 calendar days after written notice is received unless the affected person makes an application for a hearing within this period. Such application will stay the pending suspension or revocation for a period of 14 calendar days.</P>

                <P>(1) If, due to action by the government, a hearing is not held within 14 calendar days, the suspension will not <PRTPAGE P="25"/>take place until such time as the person is granted a hearing and is notified of the action of the installation commander or designee. However, if the affected person requests that the hearing be continued to a date beyond the 14-day period, the suspension or revocation will become effective immediately on receipt of notice that the request for continuance has been granted, and remain in force pending a hearing at a scheduled hearing date.</P>
                <P>(2) If it is determined as a result of a hearing to suspend or revoke the affected person's driving privilege, the suspension or revocation will become effective when the person receives the written notification of such action. In the event that written notification cannot be verified, either through a return receipt for mail or delivery through command channels, the hearing authority will determine the effective date on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>(3) If the revocation or suspension is imposed after such hearing, the person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked will have the right to appeal or request reconsideration. Such requests must be forwarded through command channels to the installation commander within 14 calendar days from the date the individual is notified of the suspension or revocation resulting from the administrative hearing. The suspension or revocation will remain in effect pending a final ruling on the request. Requests for restricted privileges will be considered per § 634.15.</P>

                <P>(4) If driving privileges are temporarily restored (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, for family hardship) pending resolution of charges, the period of revocation (after final authority determination) will still total the mandatory 12 months. The final date of the revocation will be adjusted to account for the period when the violator's privileges were temporarily restored, as this period does not count towards the revocation time.</P>
                <P>(c) For drunk driving or driving under the influence offenses, reliable evidence readily available will be presented promptly to an individual designated by the installation commander for review and authorization for immediate suspension of installation driving privileges.</P>
                <P>(1) The reviewer should be any officer to include GS-11 and above, designated in writing by the installation or garrison commander whose primary duties are not in the field of law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(2) Reliable evidence includes witness statements, military or civilian police report of apprehension, chemical test results if completed, refusal to consent to complete chemical testing, videotapes, statements by the apprehended individual, field sobriety or preliminary breath tests results, and other pertinent evidence. Immediate suspension should not be based solely on published lists of arrested persons, statements by parties not witnessing the apprehension, or telephone conversations or other information not supported by documented and reliable evidence.</P>
                <P>(3) Reviews normally will be accomplished within the first normal duty day following final assembly of evidence.</P>
                <P>(4) Installation commanders may authorize the installation law enforcement officer to conduct reviews and authorize suspensions in cases where the designated reviewer is not reasonably available and, in the judgment of the installation law enforcement officer, such immediate action is warranted. Air Force Security Forces personnel act in an advisory capacity to installation commanders. Review by the designated officer will follow as soon as practical in such cases. When a suspension notice is based on the law enforcement officer's review, there is no requirement for confirmation notice following subsequent review by the designated officer.</P>
                <P>(5) For active duty military personnel, final written notice of suspension for intoxicated driving will be provided to the individual's chain of command for immediate presentation to the individual. Air Force Security Forces provide a copy of the temporary suspension to the individual at the time of the incident or may provide a copy of the final determination at the time of the incident, as pre-determined by the final action authority.</P>

                <P>(6) For civilian personnel, written notice of suspension for intoxicated driving will normally be provided without delay via certified mail. Air Force Security Forces personnel provide a copy <PRTPAGE P="26"/>of the temporary suspension to the individual at the time of the incident or may provide a copy of the final determination at the time of the incident, as pre-determined by the final action authority. If the person is employed on the installation, such notice will be forwarded through the military or civilian supervisor. When the notice of suspension is forwarded through the supervisor, the person whose privileges are suspended will be required to provide written acknowledgment of receipt of the suspension notice.</P>
                <P>(7) Notices of suspension for intoxicated driving will include the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The fact that the suspension can be made a revocation under § 634.9(b).</P>
                <P>(ii) The right to request, in writing, a hearing before the installation commander or designee to determine if post driving privileges will be restored pending resolution of the charge; and that such request must be made within 14 calendar days of the final notice of suspension.</P>
                <P>(iii) The right of military personnel to be represented by counsel at his or her own expense and to present evidence and witnesses at his or her own expense. Installation commanders will determine the availability of any local active duty representatives requested.</P>
                <P>(iv) The right of Department of Defense civilian employees to have a personal representative present at the administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</P>
                <P>(v) Written acknowledgment of receipt to be signed by the individual whose privileges are to be suspended or revoked.</P>
                <P>(8) If a hearing is requested, it must take place within 14 calendar days of receipt of the request. The suspension for intoxicated driving will remain in effect until a decision has been made by the installation commander or designee, but will not exceed 14 calendar days after the hearing while awaiting the decision. If no decision has been made by that time, full driving privileges will be restored until such time as the accused is notified of a decision to continue the suspension.</P>
                <P>(9) Hearing on suspension actions under § 634.9(a) for drunk or impaired driving pending resolution of charges will cover only the following pertinent issues of whether—</P>
                <P>(i) The law enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</P>
                <P>(ii) The person was lawfully cited or apprehended for a driving under the influence offense.</P>
                <P>(iii) The person was lawfully requested to submit his or her blood, breath, or urine in order to determine the content of alcohol or other drugs, and was informed of the implied consent policy (consequences of refusal to take or complete the test).</P>
                <P>(iv) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result was .08 or higher blood alcohol content, or between .05 and .08 in violation of the law of the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is being operated if the jurisdiction imposes a suspension solely on the basis of the BAC level; or showed results indicating the presence of other drugs for an on-post apprehension or in violation of State laws for an off-post apprehension.</P>
                <P>(v) The testing methods were valid and reliable and the results accurately evaluated.</P>
                <P>(10) For revocation actions under § 634.9(b) (3) for intoxicated driving, the revocation is mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge. (Pleas of nolo contendere are considered equivalent to guilty pleas).</P>
                <P>(i) Revocations are effective as of the date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charges. Test refusal revocations will be in addition to any other revocation incurred during a hearing. Hearing authority will determine if revocations for multiple offenses will run consecutively or concurrently taking into consideration if offenses occurred on same occasion or different times, dates. The exception is that test refusal will be one year automatic revocation in addition to any other suspension.</P>

                <P>(ii) The notice that revocation is automatic may be placed in the suspension letter. If it does not appear in the suspension letter, a separate letter <PRTPAGE P="27"/>must be sent and revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice.</P>
                <P>(iii) Revocations cancel any full or restricted driving privileges that may have been restored during suspension and the resolution of the charges. Requests for restoration of full driving privileges are not authorized.</P>
                <P>(11) The Army Vehicle Registration System will be utilized to maintain infractions by individuals on Army installations.</P>

                <P>Army commanders will take appropriate action against intoxicated drivers. These actions may include the following:</P>
                <P>(a) A written reprimand, administrative in nature, will be issued to active duty Soldiers in the cases described in this paragraph (a). Any general officer, and any officer frocked to the grade of brigadier general, may issue this reprimand. Filing of the reprimand will be in accordance with the provisions of AR 600-37.</P>
                <P>(1) Conviction by courts-martial or civilian court or imposition of nonjudicial punishment for an offense of drunk or impaired driving either on or off the installation.</P>
                <P>(2) Refusal to take or failure to complete a lawfully requested test to measure alcohol or drug content of the blood, breath, or urine, either on or off the installation, when there is reasonable belief of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</P>
                <P>(3) Driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle on post when the blood alcohol content is 0.08 percent or higher, irrespective of other charges, or off post when the blood alcohol content is in violation of the law of the State involved.</P>
                <P>(4) Driving, or being in physical control of a motor vehicle, either on or off the installation, when lawfully conducted chemical tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs.</P>
                <P>(b) Review by the commander of the service records of active duty soldiers apprehended for offenses described in paragraph (a) of this section to determine if the following action(s) should be taken—</P>
                <P>(1) Administrative reduction per AR 600-8-19, or</P>
                <P>(2) Bar to reenlistment per AR 601-280, or</P>

                <SUBJECT>Alcohol and drug abuse programs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Commanders will refer military personnel suspected of drug or alcohol abuse for evaluation in the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) Behavior indicative of alcohol or drug abuse.</P>
                <P>(2) Continued inability to drive a motor vehicle safely because of alcohol or drug abuse.</P>
                <P>(b) The commander will ensure military personnel are referred to the installation alcohol and drug abuse program or other comparable facilities when they are convicted of, or receive an official administrative action for, any offense involving driving under the influence. A first offender may be referred to treatment if evidence of substance abuse exists in addition to the offense of intoxicated driving. The provisions of this paragraph do not limit the commander's prerogatives concerning other actions that may be taken against an offender under separate Service/Agency polices (Army, see AR 600-85. Marine Corps, see MCO P1700.24B).</P>
                <P>(c) Active duty Army personnel apprehended for drunk driving, on or off the installation, will be referred to the local Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) for evaluation within 14 calendar days to determine if the person is dependent on alcohol or other drugs which will result in enrollment in treatment in accordance with AR 600-85. A copy of all reports on military personnel and DOD civilian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving will be forwarded to the installation alcohol and drug abuse facility.</P>

                <P>(d) Active duty Navy personnel apprehended for drunk driving on or off the installation will be screened by the respective SARP facility within 14 calendar days to determine if the individual is dependent on alcohol or other drugs. Active duty Marines apprehended for intoxicated driving, on or off the installation, will be referred to <PRTPAGE P="28"/>interview by a Level II substance abuse counselor within 14 calendar days for evaluation and determination of the appropriate level of treatment required. Subsequent to this evaluation, the Marine will be assigned to the appropriate treatment programs as prescribed by MCO P1700.24B.</P>
                <P>(e) The Services/Agencies may develop preventive treatment and rehabilitative programs for civilian employees with alcohol-related problems.</P>
                <P>(f) Army supervisors of civilian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving will advise employees of ASAP services available. Civilian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving while on duty will be referred to the ASAP or comparable facility for evaluation in accordance with AR 600-85. Army commanders will ensure that sponsors encourage family members apprehended for drunk driving seek ASAP evaluation and assistance.</P>
                <P>(g) Navy and DLA civilian personnel charged with intoxicated driving will be referred to the Civilian Employee Assistance Program in accordance with 5 CFR part 792. Such referral does not exempt the employee from appropriate administrative or disciplinary actions under civilian personnel regulations.</P>
                <P>(h) Marine Corps civilian employees charged with intoxicated driving, on or off the installation, will be referred to the Employee Assistance Program as prescribed by MCO P1700.24B. Marine family members charged with intoxicated driving, on or off the installation, will be provided assistance as addressed in MCO P1700.24B. Such referral and assistance does not exempt the individual from appropriate administrative or disciplinary action under current civilian personnel regulations or State laws.</P>
                <P>(i) For the Army, DLA, and the Marine Corps, installation driving privileges of any person who refuses to submit to, or fails to complete, chemical testing for blood-alcohol content when apprehended for intoxicated driving, or convicted of intoxicated driving, will not be reinstated unless the person successfully completes either an alcohol education or treatment program sponsored by the installation, state, county, or municipality, or other program evaluated as acceptable by the installation commander.</P>
                <P>(j) Active duty Air Force personnel apprehended for drunk driving, on or off the installation, will be referred by their respective chain of command to the Air Force Substance Abuse office for evaluation in accordance with AFI 44-121/Alcohol Drug Abuse &amp; Treatment Program, and local policies within seven days.</P>
                <P>(k) Local installation commanders will determine if active duty Air Force personnel involved in any alcohol incident will immediately be subjected to a urinalysis for drug content. If consent is not given for the test, a command-directed test will be administered in accordance with local policies.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Restoration of driving privileges upon acquittal of intoxicated driving.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The suspension of driving privileges for military and civilian personnel shall be restored if a final disposition indicates a finding of not guilty, charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxicated driving, or where an equivalent determination is made in a nonjudicial proceeding. The following are exceptions to the rule in which suspensions will continue to be enforced.</P>
                <P>(a) The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.</P>
                <P>(b) The preliminary suspension resulted from a valid BAC test, (unless disposition of the charges was based on invalidity of the BAC test). In the case of a valid BAC test, the suspension will continue, pending completion of a hearing as specified in § 634.11. In such instances, the individual will be notified in writing that the suspension will continue and of the opportunity to request a hearing within 14 calendar days.</P>
                <P>(1) At the hearing, the arrest report, the commander's report of official disposition, information presented by the individual, and such other information as the hearing officer may deem appropriate will be considered.</P>

                <P>(2) If the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the individual was engaged in intoxicated driving, the revocation will be <PRTPAGE P="29"/>for 1 year from the date of the original preliminary suspension.</P>
                <P>(c) The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under a preliminary suspension or revocation.</P>
                <P>(d) An administrative determination has been made by the state or host nation licensing authority to suspend or revoke driving privileges.</P>

                <P>(b) Army requests for restricted driving privileges subsequent to suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges will be referred to the installation commander or designee, except for intoxicated driving cases, which must be referred to the General Court Martial Convening Authority. Withdrawal of restricted driving privileges is within the installation commander's discretion.</P>
                <P>(c) Probation or restricted driving privileges will not be granted to any person whose driver license or right to operate motor vehicles is under suspension or revocation by a state, Federal, or host nation licensing authority. Prior to application for probation or restricted driving privileges, a state, Federal, or host nation driver's license or right to operate motor vehicles must be reinstated. The burden of proof for reinstatement of driving privileges lies with the person applying for probation or restricted driving privileges. Revocations for test refusals shall remain.</P>
                <P>(d) The installation commander or designee may grant restricted driving privileges or probation on a case-by-case basis provided the person's state or host nation driver's license or right to operate motor vehicles remains valid to accommodate any of the following reasons:</P>
                <P>(1) Mission requirements.</P>
                <P>(2) Unusual personal or family hardships.</P>
                <P>(3) Delays exceeding 90 days, not attributed to the person concerned, in the formal disposition of an apprehension or charges that are the basis for any type of suspension or revocation.</P>
                <P>(4) When there is no reasonably available alternate means of transportation to officially assigned duties. In this instance, a limited exception can be granted for the sole purpose of driving directly to and from the place of duty.</P>
                <P>(e) The terms and limitations on a restricted driving privilege (for example, authorization to drive to and from place of employment or duty, or selected installation facilities such as hospital, commissary, and or other facilities) will be specified in writing and provided to the individual concerned. Persons found in violation of the restricted privilege are subject to revocation action as prescribed in § 634.9.</P>
                <P>(f) The conditions and terms of probation will be specified in writing and provided to the individual concerned. The original suspension or revocation term in its entirety may be activated to commence from the date of the violation of probation. In addition, separate action may be initiated based on the commission of any traffic, criminal, or military offense that constitutes a probation violation.</P>
                <P>(g) DOD employees and contractors, who can demonstrate that suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges would constructively remove them from employment, may be given a limiting suspension/revocation that restricts driving on the installation or activity (or in the overseas command) to the most direct route to and from their respective work sites (5 U.S.C. 2302(b) (10)). This is not to be construed as limiting the commander from suspension or revocation of on-duty driving privileges or seizure of OF 346, even if this action would constructively remove a person from employment in those instances in which the person's duty requires driving from place to place on the installation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reciprocal state-military action.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Commanders will recognize the interests of the states in matters of <PRTPAGE P="30"/>POV administration and driver licensing. Statutory authority may exist within some states or host nations for reciprocal suspension and revocation of driving privileges. See subpart D of this part for additional information on exchanging and obtaining information with civilian law enforcement agencies concerning infractions by Armed Service personnel off post. Installation commanders will honor the reciprocal authority and direct the installation law enforcement officer to pursue reciprocity with state or host nation licensing authorities. Upon receipt of written or other official law enforcement communication relative to the suspension/revocation of driving privileges, the receiving installation will terminate driving privileges as if violations occurred within its own jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(b) When imposing a suspension or revocation for an off-installation offense, the effective date should be the same as civil disposition, or the date that state or host-nation driving privileges are suspended or revoked. This effective date can be retroactive.</P>
                <P>(c) If statutory authority does not exist within the state or host nation for formal military reciprocity, the procedures below will be adopted:</P>
                <P>(1) Commanders will recognize official documentation of suspensions/revocations imposed by state or host nation authorities. Administrative actions (suspension/revocations, or if recognized, point assessment) for moving traffic violations off the installation should not be less than required for similar offenses on the installation. When notified by state or host nation authorities of a suspension or revocation, the person's OF 346 may also be suspended.</P>
                <P>(2) In CONUS, the host and issuing state licensing authority will be notified as soon as practical when a person's installation driving privileges are suspended or revoked for any period, and immediately for refusal to submit to a lawful BAC test. The notification will be sent to the appropriate state DMV(s) per reciprocal agreements. In the absence of electronic communication technology, the appropriate state DMV(s) will be notified by official certified mail. The notification will include the basis for the suspension/revocation and the BAC level if applicable.</P>
                <P>(d) OCONUS installation commanders must follow provisions of the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), the law of the host nation concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation, and other international agreements. To the extent an agreement concerning reciprocity may be permitted at a particular overseas installation, the commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude such an international agreement in accordance with applicable international agreements, DODD 5530.3, International Agreements, June 87, and other individual Service instructions.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Extensions of suspensions and revocations.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Driving in violation of a suspension or revocation imposed under this part will result in the original period of suspension or revocation being increased by 2 years. In addition, administrative action may be initiated based on the commission of any traffic, criminal, or military offenses, for example, active duty military personnel driving on the installation in violation of a lawful order.</P>
                <P>(b) For each subsequent determination within a 5-year period that revocation is authorized under § 634.9, military personnel, DOD civilians, contractors and NAF employees will be prohibited from obtaining or using an OF 346 for 6 months for each such incident. A determination whether DOD civilian personnel should be prohibited from obtaining or using an OF 346 will be made in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to civilian personnel. This does not preclude a commander from imposing such prohibition for a first offense, or for a longer period of time for a first or subsequent offense, or for such other reasons as may be authorized.</P>
                <P>(c) Commanders may extend a suspension or revocation of driving privileges on personnel until completion of an approved remedial driver training course or alcohol or drug counseling programs after proof is provided.</P>

                <P>(d) Commanders may extend a suspension or revocation of driving privileges on civilian personnel convicted of <PRTPAGE P="31"/>intoxicated driving on the installation until successful completion of a state or installation approved alcohol or drug rehabilitation program.</P>
                <P>(e) For Navy personnel for good cause, the appropriate authority may withdraw the restricted driving privilege and continue the suspension or revocation period (for example, driver at fault in the traffic accident, or driver cited for a moving violation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Registration policy.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Motor vehicles will be registered according to guidance in this part and in policies of each Service and DLA. A person who lives or works on an Army, DLA, Air Force, Navy, or Marine Corps installation, or Army National Guard of the U.S. (ARNGUS) facility, or often uses the facilities is required to register his or her vehicle. Also, individuals who access the installation for regular activities such as use of medical facilities and regular recurring activities on the installation should register their vehicles according to a standard operating procedure established by the installation commander. The person need not own the vehicle to register it, but must have a lease agreement, power of attorney, or notarized statement from the owner of the vehicle specifying the inclusive dates for which permission to use the vehicle has been granted.</P>
                <P>(b) Vehicles intended for construction and material handling, or used solely off the road, are usually not registered as motor vehicles. Installation commanders may require registration of off-road vehicles and bicycles under a separate local system.</P>
                <P>(c) Commanders can grant limited temporary registration for up to 30 days, pending permanent registration, or in other circumstances for longer terms.</P>
                <P>(d) Except for reasons of security, all installations and activities of the Services and DLA within the United States and its territories with a vehicle registration system will use and honor the DD Form 2220, (Department of Defense Registration Decal). Registration in overseas commands may be modified in accordance with international agreements or military necessity.</P>
                <P>(e) Army Installation commanders will establish local visitor identification for individuals who will be on installation for less than 30 days. The local policy will provide for use of temporary passes that establish a start and end date for which the pass is valid. Army installation commanders must refer to AR 190-16 Chapter 2 for guidance concerning installation access control. (Air Force, see AFI 31-204). Other Armed Services and DLA may develop and issue visitor passes locally.</P>
                <P>(f) The conditions in § 634.20 must be met to operate a POV on an Army and DLA Installation. Other Armed Services that do not require registration will enforce § 634.20 through traffic enforcement actions. Additionally, failure to comply with § 634.20 may result in administrative suspension or revocation of driving privileges.</P>

                <P>Personnel seeking to register their POVs on military installations within the United States or its territories and in overseas areas will comply with the following requirements. (Registration in overseas commands may be modified in accordance with international agreements or military necessity.)</P>

                <P>(a) Possess a valid state, overseas command, host nation or international drivers license (within appropriate classification), supported by DD Form 2, or other appropriate identification for DOD civilians, contractors and retirees. DA Form 1602, Civilian Identification Card, is limited for identification on Army installations only.<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Possess a certificate of state registration as required by the state in which the vehicle is registered.</P>
                <P>(c) Comply with the minimum requirements of the automobile insurance laws or regulations of the state or host nation. In overseas commands where host nation laws do not require minimum personal injury and property damage liability insurance, the major overseas commander will set reasonable liability insurance requirements for registration and/or operation of POVs within the confines of military installations and areas where the commander exercises jurisdiction. Prior to implementation, insurance requirements in host states or nations should be formally coordinated with the appropriate host agency.</P>
                <P>(d) Satisfactorily complete a safety and mechanical vehicle inspection by the state or jurisdiction in which the vehicle is licensed. If neither state nor local jurisdiction requires a periodic safety inspection, installation commanders may require and conduct an annual POV safety inspection; however, inspection facilities must be reasonably accessible to those requiring use. Inspections will meet minimum standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 49 CFR 570.1 through 570.10. Lights, turn signals, brake lights, horn, wipers, and pollution control devices and standards in areas where applicable, should be included in the inspection. Vehicles modified from factory standards and determined unsafe may be denied access and registration.</P>
                <P>(e) Possess current proof of compliance with local vehicle emission inspection if required by the state, and maintenance requirements.</P>
                <P>(f) Vehicles with elevated front or rear ends that have been modified in a mechanically unsafe manner are unsafe and will be denied registration. 49 CFR 570.8 states that springs shall not be extended above the vehicle manufacturer's design height.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Department of Defense Form 2220.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Use.</E> DD Form 2220 will be used to identify registered POVs on Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and DLA installations or facilities. The form is produced in single copy for conspicuous placement on the front of the vehicle only (windshield or bumper). If allowed by state laws, the decal is placed in the center by the rear view mirror or the lower portion of the driver's side windshield. The requirement to affix the DD Form 2220 to the front windshield or bumper of registered vehicles is waived for General Officers and Flag Officers of all Armed Services, Armed Service Secretaries, Political Appointees, Members of Congress, and the Diplomatic Corps.</P>
                <P>(1) Each Service and DLA will procure its own forms and installation and expiration tabs. For the Army, the basic decal will be ordered through publications channels and remain on the vehicle until the registered owner disposes of the vehicle, separates from active duty or other conditions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Air Force, DLA, and Army retirees may retain DD Form 2220. Army retirees are required to follow the same registration and VRS procedures as active duty personnel. Upon termination of affiliation with the service, the registered owner or authorized operator is responsible for removing the DD Form 2220 from the vehicle and surrender of the decal to the issuing office. Army installation commanders are responsible for the costs of procuring decals with the name of their installation and related expiration tabs. Air Force installations will use the installation tag (4″ by <FR>1/2</FR>″) to identify the Air Force Installation where the vehicle is registered. Air Force personnel may retain the DD Form 2220 upon reassignment, retirement, or separation provided the individual is still eligible for continued registration, the registration is updated in SFMIS, and the installation tab is changed accordingly. Position the decal directly under the DD Form 2220.</P>

                <P>(2) For other Armed Services and DLA, DD Form 2220 and installation and expiration tabs will be removed from POV's by the owner prior to departure from their current installation, retirement, or separation from military or government affiliation, termination of ownership, registration, liability insurance, or other conditions further identified by local policy.<PRTPAGE P="33"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Specifications.</E> (1) DD Form 2220 and installation and expiration tabs will consist of international blue borders and printing on a white background. Printer information will include the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Form title (Department of Defense Registered Vehicle).</P>
                <P>(ii) Alphanumeric individual form identification number.</P>
                <P>(iii) DOD seal.</P>
                <P>(2) Name of the installation will be specified on a separate tab abutting the decal. Each Service or DLA may choose optional color codes for the registrant. Army and installations having vehicle registration programs will use the following standard color scheme for the installation tab:</P>
                <P>(i) Blue-officers.</P>
                <P>(ii) Red-enlisted.</P>
                <P>(iii) Green DA civilian employees (including NAF employees).</P>
                <P>(iv) Black-contractor personnel and other civilians employed on the installation. White will be used for contract personnel on Air Force installations.</P>
                <P>(3) An expiration tab identifying the month and year (6-2004), the year (2000) or simply “00” will be abutted to right of the decal. For identification purposes, the date of expiration will be shown in bold block numbers on a lighter contrasting background such as traffic yellow, lime, or orange.</P>
                <P>(4) DD Form 2220 and any adjoining tabs will be theft resistant when applied to glass, metal, painted, or rubberized surfaces and manufactured so as to obliterate or self destruct when removal is attempted. Local policy guided by state or host nation laws will specify the exact placement of DD Form 2220.</P>
                <P>(5) For Navy and Marine Corps military personnel the grade insignia will be affixed on placards, approximately 5 inches by 8 inches in size, and placed on the driver's side dashboard. Placards should be removed from view when the vehicle is not located on a military installation.</P>

                <P>Installation commanders or their designated representatives will terminate POV registration or deny initial registration under the following conditions (decal and tabs will be removed from the vehicle when registration is terminated):</P>
                <P>(a) The owner fails to comply with the registration requirements.</P>
                <P>(b) The owner sells or disposes of the POV, is released from active duty, separated from the Service, or terminates civilian employment with a military Service or DOD agency. Army and Air Force personnel on a permanent change of station will retain the DD Form 2220 if the vehicle is moved to their new duty station.</P>
                <P>(c) The owner is other than an active duty military or civilian employee and discontinues regular operations of the POV on the installation.</P>
                <P>(d) The owner's state, overseas command, or host nation driver's license is suspended or revoked, or the installation driving privilege is revoked. Air Force does not require removal of the DD Form 2220 when driving privileges are suspended for an individual. When vehicle registration is terminated in conjunction with the revocation of installation driving privileges, the affected person must apply to re-register the POV after the revocation expires. Registration should not be terminated if other family members having installation driving privileges require use of the vehicle.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Traffic planning and codes.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision. A traffic supervision program includes traffic circulation planning and control of motor vehicle traffic; publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations; and investigation of motor vehicle accidents.</P>
                <P>(b) Installation commanders will develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most efficient use of primary and secondary roads. Circulation planning should be a major part of all long-range master planning at installations. The traffic circulation plan is developed by the installation law enforcement officer, engineer, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies. Highway engineering representatives from adjacent civil communities must be consulted to ensure the installation plan is compatible with the current and future circulation plan of the community. The plan should include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.</P>
                <P>(2) Effective control of traffic using planned direction, including measures for special events and adverse road or weather conditions.</P>
                <P>(3) Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.</P>
                <P>(4) Use of traffic control signs and devices.</P>
                <P>(5) Efficient use of available parking facilities.</P>
                <P>(6) Efficient use of mass transportation.</P>
                <P>(c) Traffic control studies will provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns, and points of congestion. The installation law enforcement officer and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data will help determine major and minor routes, location of traffic control devices, and conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.</P>
                <P>(d) The (Military) Surface Deployment and Distribution Command Transportation Engineering Agency (SDDCTEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. SDDCTEA traffic engineering services include—</P>
                <P>(1) Traffic studies of limited areas and situations.</P>
                <P>(2) Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations. (This can include long-range planning for future development of installation roads, public highways, and related facilities.)</P>
                <P>(3) Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.</P>
                <P>(e) Installation commanders should submit requests for traffic engineering services in accordance with applicable service or agency directives.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Installation traffic codes.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Installation or activity commanders will establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the installation. Commanders in overseas areas will establish a traffic code, under provisions of this part, to the extent military authority is empowered to regulate traffic on the installation under the applicable SOFA. Traffic codes will contain the rules of the road (parking violations, towing instructions, safety equipment, and other key provisions). These codes will, where possible, conform to the code of the State or host nation in which the installation is located. In addition, the development and publication of installation traffic codes will be based on the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Highway Safety Program Standards (23 U.S.C. 402).</P>
                <P>(2) Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances.</P>
                <P>(b) The installation traffic code will contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching, impounding, and inventorying of POVs. These provisions should be well publicized and contain the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Specific violations and conditions under which the POV will be impounded and towed.</P>
                <P>(2) Procedures to immediately notify the vehicle owner.</P>

                <P>(3) Procedures for towing and storing impounded vehicles.<PRTPAGE P="35"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) Actions to dispose of the vehicle after lawful impoundment.</P>
                <P>(5) Violators are responsible for all costs of towing, storage and impounding of vehicles for other than evidentiary reasons.</P>
                <P>(c) Installation traffic codes will also contain the provisions discussed as follows: (Army users, see AR 385-55).</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Motorcycles and mopeds.</E> For motorcycles and other self-propelled, open, two-wheel, three-wheel, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motorcycle-type engine, the following traffic rules apply:</P>
                <P>(i) Headlights will be on at all times when in operation.</P>
                <P>(ii) A rear view mirror will be attached to each side of the handlebars.</P>
                <P>(iii) Approved protective helmets, eye protection, hard-soled shoes, long trousers and brightly colored or reflective outer upper garment will be worn by operators and passengers when in operation.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Restraint systems.</E> (i) Restraint systems (seat belts) will be worn by all operators and passengers of U.S. Government vehicles on or off the installation.</P>
                <P>(ii) Restraint systems will be worn by all civilian personnel (family members, guests, and visitors) driving or riding in a POV on the installation.</P>
                <P>(iii) Restraint systems will be worn by all military service members and Reserve Component members on active Federal service driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.</P>
                <P>(iv) Infant/child restraint devices (car seats) will be required in POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 45 pounds in weight.</P>
                <P>(v) Restraint systems are required only in vehicles manufactured after model year 1966.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Driver distractions.</E> Vehicle operators on a DoD Installation and operators of Government owned vehicles shall not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device. The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hand-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited. Use of those devices impairs driving and masks or prevents recognition of emergency signals, alarms, announcements, the approach of vehicles, and human speech. DoD Component safety guidance should note the potential for driver distractions such as eating and drinking, operating radios, CD players, global positioning equipment, etc. Whenever possible this should only be done when the vehicle is safely parked.</P>
                <P>(d) Only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of on-post driving privileges, or other actions) will be initiated against service members for off-post violations of the installation traffic code.</P>
                <P>(e) In States where traffic law violations are State criminal offenses, such laws are made applicable under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 13 to military installations having concurrent or exclusive Federal jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(f) In those States where violations of traffic law are not considered criminal offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 U.S.C., DODD 5525.4, enclosure 1 expressly adopts the vehicular and pedestrian traffic laws of such States and makes these laws applicable to military installations having concurrent or exclusive Federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regulations for their installations. Persons found guilty of violating the vehicular and pedestrian traffic laws made applicable on the installation under provisions of that directive are subject to a fine as determined by the local magistrate or imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both, for each violation. In those States where traffic laws cannot be assimilated, an extract copy of this paragraph (f) and a copy of the delegation memorandum in DODD 5525.4, enclosure 1, will be posted in a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.</P>

                <P>(g) In those States where violations of traffic laws cannot be assimilated because the Federal Government's jurisdictional authority on the installation or parts of the installation is only proprietary, neither 18 U.S.C. 13 nor the delegation memorandum in DoDD <PRTPAGE P="36"/>5525.4, enclosure 1, will permit enforcement of the State's traffic laws in Federal courts. Law enforcement authorities on those military installations must rely on either administrative sanctions related to the installation driving privilege or enforcement of traffic laws by State law enforcement authorities.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Traffic law enforcement principles.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should emphasize voluntary compliance by drivers and can be achieved by the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.</P>
                <P>(2) Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with NHSPS and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways.</P>
                <P>(3) Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers and act promptly when driving behavior is improper or a defective vehicle is observed in operation.</P>
                <P>(4) Maintaining an aggressive program to detect and apprehend persons who drive while privileges are suspended or revoked.</P>
                <P>(5) Using sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue citations, or warn the offender.</P>
                <P>(b) Selective enforcement will be used when practical. Selective enforcement deters traffic violations and reduces accidents by the presence or suggested presence of law enforcement personnel at places where violations, congestion, or accidents frequently occur. Selective enforcement applies proper enforcement measures to traffic congestion and focuses on selected time periods, conditions, and violations that cause accidents. Law enforcement personnel use selective enforcement because that practice is the most effective use of resources.</P>
                <P>(c) Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include—</P>
                <P>(1) Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</P>
                <P>(2) Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement techniques.</P>
                <P>(3) Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards. (See § 634.34).</P>
                <P>(4) Denying installation driving privileges to persons whose use of alcohol or other drugs prevents safe operation of a motor vehicle.</P>
                <P>(d) Installation officials will formally evaluate traffic enforcement on a regular basis. That evaluation will examine procedures to determine if the following elements of the program are effective in reducing traffic accidents and deaths:</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Accidents requiring immediate reports.</E> The driver or owner of any vehicle involved in an accident, as described in § 634.28, on the installation, must immediately notify the installation law enforcement office. The operator of any Government vehicle involved in a similar accident off the installation must immediately notify the local civilian law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, as well as law enforcement personnel of the nearest military installation.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Investigation records.</E> Installation law enforcement officials will record traffic accident investigations on Service/DLA forms. Information will be released according to Service/DLA policy, the Privacy Act, and the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Army law enforcement officers.</E> These officers provide the local Safety Office copies of traffic accident investigation reports pertaining to accidents investigated by military police that resulted in a fatality, personal injury, or estimated damage to Government vehicles or property in excess of $1,000.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">POV accidents not addressed in § 634.28.</E> Guidance for reporting these cases is provided as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Drivers or owners of POVs will be required to submit a written report to the installation law enforcement office within 24 hours of an accident in the following cases, with all information listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) The accident occurs on the installation.</P>
                <P>(ii) The accident involves no personal injury.</P>
                <P>(iii) The accident involves only minor damage to the POV and the vehicle can be safely and normally driven from the scene under its own power.</P>

                <P>(2) Information in the written report cannot be used in criminal proceedings against the person submitting it unless it was originally categorized a hit and run and the violator is the person submitting the report. Rights advisement will be given prior to any criminal traffic statements provided by violators. <PRTPAGE P="38"/>Within the United States, the installation law enforcement official may require such reporting on Service forms or forms of the State jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(3) Reports required in paragraph (d) (1) of this section by the Army will include the following about the accident:</P>
                <P>(i) Location, date, and time.</P>
                <P>(ii) Identification of all drivers, pedestrians, and passengers involved.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use of traffic accident investigation report data.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Data derived from traffic accident investigation reports and from vehicle owner accident reports will be analyzed to determine probable causes of accidents. When frequent accidents occur at a location, the conditions at the location and the types of accidents (collision diagram) will be examined.</P>
                <P>(b) Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will indicate whether or not seat restraint devices were being used at the time of the accident.</P>
                <P>(c) When accidents warrant, an installation commander may establish a traffic accident review board. The board will consist of law enforcement, engineer, safety, medical, and legal personnel. The board will determine principal factors leading to the accident and recommend measures to reduce the number and severity of accidents on and off the installation. (The Air Force will use Traffic Safety Coordinating Groups. The Navy will use Traffic Safety Councils per OPNAVINST 5100.12 Series).</P>
                <P>(d) Data will be shared with the installation legal, engineer, safety, and transportation officers. The data will be used to inform and educate drivers and to conduct traffic engineering studies.</P>
                <P>(e) Army traffic accident investigation reports will be provided to Army Centralized Accident Investigation of Ground Accidents (CAIG) boards on request. The CAIG boards are under the control of the Commander, U.S. Army Safety Center, Fort Rucker, AL 36362-5363. These boards investigate Class A, on-duty, non-POV accidents and other selected accidents Army-wide (See AR 385-40). Local commanders provide additional board members as required to complete a timely and accurate investigation. Normally, additional board members are senior equipment operators, maintenance officer, and medical officers. However, specific qualifications of the additional board members may be dictated by the nature of the accident.</P>
                <P>(f) The CAIG program is not intended to interfere with, impede, or delay law enforcement agencies in the execution of regulatory responsibilities that apply to the investigation of accidents for a determination of criminal intent or criminal acts. Criminal investigations have priority.</P>
                <P>(g) Army law enforcement agencies will maintain close liaison and cooperation with CAIG boards. Such cooperation, particularly with respect to interviews of victims and witnesses and in collection and preservation of physical evidence, should support both the CAIG and law enforcement collateral investigations.</P>

                <P>(a) The most efficient use of existing on- and off-street parking space should be stressed on a nonreserved (first-come, first-served) basis.</P>
                <P>(b) Reserved parking facilities should be designated as parking by permit or numerically by category of eligible parkers. Designation of parking spaces by name, grade, rank, or title should be avoided.</P>

                <P>(c) Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on an installation. Strong enforcement of parking restrictions results in better use of available parking facilities and eliminates conditions causing traffic accidents.<PRTPAGE P="39"/>

                <P>(d) The “Denver boot” device is authorized for use as a technique to assist in the enforcement of parking violations where immobilization of the POV is necessary for safety. Under no circumstances should the device be used to punish or “teach a lesson” to violators. Booting should not be used if other reasonably effective but less restrictive means of enforcement (such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revocations, or suspensions of on-post driving privileges) are available. Procedures for booting must be developed as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Local standing operating procedures (SOPs) must be developed to control the discretion of enforcers and limit booting to specific offenses. SOPs should focus on specific reasons for booting, such as immobilization of unsafe, uninspected, or unregistered vehicles or compelling the presence of repeat offenders. All parking violations must be clearly outlined in the installation traffic code.</P>
                <P>(2) Drivers should be placed on notice that particular violations or multiple violations may result in booting. Also, drivers must be provided with a prompt hearing and an opportunity to obtain the release of their property.</P>
                <P>(3) To limit liability, drivers must be warned when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instructed how to have the boot removed without damaging the vehicle.</P>

                <P>(a) Most traffic violations occurring on DOD installations (within the UNITED STATES or its territories) should be referred to the proper U.S. Magistrate. (Army, see AR 190-29; DLA, see DLAI 5720.4; and Air Force, see AFI 51-905). However, violations are not referred when—</P>
                <P>(1) The operator is driving a Government vehicle at the time of the violation.</P>
                <P>(2) A Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter because the violation occurred in an area where the Federal Government has only proprietary legislative jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(3) Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.</P>
                <P>(4) A U.S. Magistrate is available but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the court and the U.S. Attorney refuses to process the case before a U.S. District Court. For the Navy, DUI and driving under the influence of drugs cases will be referred to the Federal Magistrate.</P>
                <P>(b) Installation commanders will establish administrative procedures for processing traffic violations.</P>
                <P>(1) All traffic violators on military installations will be issued either a DD Form 1408 (Armed Forces Traffic Ticket) or a DD Form 1805 (United States District Court Violation Notice), as appropriate. Unless specified otherwise by separate Service/DLA policy, only on-duty law enforcement personnel (including game wardens) designated by the installation law enforcement officer may issue these forms. Air Force individuals certified under the Parking Traffic Warden Program may issue DD Form 1408 in areas under their control.</P>
                <P>(2) A copy of all reports on military personnel and DOD civilian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving will be forwarded to the installation alcohol and drug abuse facility.</P>
                <P>(c) Installation commanders will establish procedures used for disposing of traffic violation cases through administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and Federal law.</P>
                <P>(d) DD Form 1805 will be used to refer violations of State traffic laws made applicable to the installation (Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. 13) and the delegation memorandum in DoDD 5525.4, enclosure 1, and other violations of Federal law) to the U.S. Magistrate. (Army users, see AR 190-29.)</P>
                <P>(1) A copy of DD Form 1805 and any traffic violation reports on military personnel and DOD civilian employees will be forwarded to the commander or supervisor of the violator. DA form 3975 may be used to forward the report.</P>
                <P>(2) Detailed instructions for properly completing DD Form 1805 are contained in separate Service policy directives.</P>

                <P>(3) The assimilation of State traffic laws as Federal offenses should be identified by a specific State code reference in the CODE SECTION block of the DD <PRTPAGE P="40"/>Form 1805 (or in a complaint filed with the U.S. Magistrate).</P>
                <P>(4) The Statement of Probable Cause on the DD Form 1805 will be used according to local staff judge advocate and U.S. Magistrate court policy. The Statement of Probable Cause is required by the Federal misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.</P>
                <P>(5) For cases referred to U.S. Magistrates, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) The installation law enforcement official will forward copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the U.S. District Court (Central Violation Bureau).</P>
                <P>(ii) The installation law enforcement office will file copy 3 (pink).</P>
                <P>(iii) Law enforcement personnel will provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.</P>
                <P>(e) When DD Form 1408 is used, one copy (including written warnings) will be forwarded through command channels to the service member's commander, to the commander of the military family member's sponsor, or to the civilian's supervisor or employer as the installation commander may establish.</P>
                <P>(1) Previous traffic violations committed by the offender and points assessed may be shown.</P>
                <P>(2) For violations that require a report of action taken, the DD Form 1408 will be returned to the office of record through the reviewing authority as the installation commander may establish.</P>
                <P>(3) When the report is received by the office of record, that office will enter the action on the violator's driving record.</P>

                <P>(1) If the percentage of alcohol in the person's blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the person is not under the influence of alcohol.</P>
                <P>(2) If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.08, presume the person may be impaired. This standard may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.</P>
                <P>(3) If the percentage is 0.08 or more, or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person was driving while intoxicated.</P>
                <P>(b) Percentages in paragraph (a) of this section are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. These presumptions will be considered with other evidence in determining intoxication.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Involuntary extraction of bodily fluids in traffic cases.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The procedures outlined in this section pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Extractions of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations are governed by the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Military Rule of Evidence 315 (2002) (MRE 315), and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches.</P>
                <P>(1) Air Force policy on nonconsensual extraction of blood samples is addressed in AFI 44-102.</P>
                <P>(2) Army and Marine Corps personnel should not undertake the nonconsensual extraction of body fluids for reasons other than a valid medical purpose without first obtaining the advice and concurrence of the installation staff judge advocate or his or her designee.</P>
                <P>(3) DLA policy on nonconsensual taking of blood samples is contained in DLAR 5700.7.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rule.</E> Involuntary bodily fluid extraction must be based on valid search and seizure authorization. An individual subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, as described in § 634.37, may nonetheless be subjected to an involuntary extraction of bodily fluids, including blood and urine, only in accordance with the following procedures:</P>

                <P>(1) An individual subject to the UCMJ who was driving a motor vehicle and suspected of being under the influence of an intoxicant may be subjected to a nonconsensual bodily fluid extraction to test for the presence of intoxicants only when there is a probable cause to believe that such an individual was driving or in control of a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant.<PRTPAGE P="43"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate obtained pursuant to MRE 315, is required prior to such nonconsensual extraction.</P>
                <P>(ii) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear indication that evidence of intoxication will be found and there is reason to believe that the delay necessary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought.</P>
                <P>(iii) Because warrantless searches are subject to close scrutiny by the courts, obtaining an authorization is highly preferable. Warrantless searches generally should be conducted only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate or legal officer, and attempts to obtain authorization from an appropriate official prove unsuccessful due to the unavailability of a commander or military magistrate.</P>
                <P>(2) If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful due to the unavailability of such officials, the commander of a medical facility is empowered by MRE 315, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the time the authorization is sought.</P>
                <P>(i) Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facility should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate or legal officer.</P>
                <P>(ii) The medical facility commander authorizing the extraction under MRE 315 need not be on duty as the attending physician at the facility where the extraction is to be performed and the actual extraction may be accomplished by other qualified medical personnel.</P>
                <P>(iii) The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individual in determining probable cause.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Role of medical personnel.</E> Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of, and not limited by, provisions defining medical care, such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AR 600-20, section IV. Extraction of blood will be accomplished by qualified medical personnel. (See MRE 312(g)).</P>
                <P>(1) In performing this duty, medical personnel are expected to use only that amount of force that is reasonable and necessary to administer the extraction.</P>
                <P>(2) Any force necessary to overcome an individual's resistance to the extraction normally will be provided by law enforcement personnel or by personnel acting under orders from the member's unit commander.</P>
                <P>(3) Life endangering force will not be used in an attempt to effect nonconsensual extractions.</P>
                <P>(4) All law enforcement and medical personnel will keep in mind the possibility that the individual may require medical attention for possible disease or injury.</P>
                <P>(d) Nonconsensual extractions of blood will be done in a manner that will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention. Medical personnel will determine the priority to be given involuntary blood extractions when other medical treatment is required.</P>
                <P>(e) Use of Army medical treatment facilities and personnel for blood alcohol testing has no relevance to whether or not the suspect is eligible for military medical treatment. The medical effort in such instances is in support of a valid military mission (law enforcement), not related to providing medical treatment to an individual.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Testing at the request of the apprehended person.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A person subject to tests under § 634.8 may request that an additional test be done privately. The person may choose a doctor, qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person to do the test. The person must pay the cost of the test. The test must be a chemical test approved by the State or host nation in an overseas command. All tests will be completed as soon as possible, with any delay being noted on the results.</P>

                <P>(b) If the person requests this test, the suspect is responsible for making all arrangements. If the suspect fails to or cannot obtain any additional test, the results of the tests that were done at the direction of a law enforcement official are not invalid and may still be used to support actions under separate <PRTPAGE P="44"/>Service regulations, UCMJ, and the U.S. Magistrate Court.</P>

                <P>In areas not under military control, civil authorities enforce traffic laws. Law enforcement authorities will establish a system to exchange information with civil authorities. Army and Air Force installation law enforcement authorities will establish a system to exchange information with civil authorities to enhance the chain of command's visibility of a soldier's and airman's off post traffic violations. These agreements will provide for the assessment of traffic points based on reports from state licensing authorities involving Army military personnel. The provisions of subpart E of this part and the VRS automated system provide for the collection of off post traffic incident reports and data. As provided in AR 190-45, civilian law enforcement agencies are considered routine users of Army law enforcement data and will be granted access to data when available from Army law enforcement systems of records. Off-installation traffic activities in overseas areas are governed by formal agreements with the host nation government. Procedures should be established to process reports received from civil authorities on serious traffic violations, accidents, and intoxicated driving incidents involving persons subject to this part. The exchange of information is limited to Army and Air Force military personnel. Provost marshals will not collect and use data concerning civilian employees, family members, and contract personnel except as allowed by state and Federal laws.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Point system procedures.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805 will serve as a basis for determining point assessment. For DD Form 1408, return endorsements will be required from commanders or supervisors.<PRTPAGE P="47"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation, the unit commander, designated supervisor, or person otherwise designated by the installation commander will conduct an inquiry. The commander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action. If a case involves judicial or nonjudicial actions, the final report of action taken will not be forwarded until final adjudication.</P>
                <P>(c) On receipt of the report of action taken (including action by a U.S. Magistrate Court on DD Form 1805), the installation law enforcement officer will assess the number of points appropriate for the offense, and record the traffic points or the suspension or revocation of driving privileges on the person's driving record. Except as specified otherwise in this part and other Service/DLA regulations, points will not be assessed or driving privileges suspended or revoked when the report of action taken indicates that neither disciplinary nor administrative action was taken.</P>
                <P>(d) Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropriate:</P>
                <P>(1) Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has acquired six traffic points within a 6-month period.</P>
                <P>(2) Counseling or driver improvement interview, by the unit commander, of any person who has acquired more than six but less than 12 traffic points within a 6-month period. This counseling or interview should produce recommendations to improve driver performance.</P>
                <P>(3) Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to have mental or physical limits that have had or may have an adverse affect on driving performance.</P>
                <P>(4) Attendance at remedial driver training to improve driving performance.</P>
                <P>(5) Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counseling, or treatment. This action is required for active military personnel in all cases in which alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.</P>
                <P>(e) An individual's driving privileges may be suspended or revoked as provided by this part regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.</P>
                <P>(f) Persons whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24 consecutive months) will be notified in writing through official channels (§ 634.11). Except for the mandatory minimum or maximum suspension or revocation periods prescribed by table 5-1 of this part, the installation commander will establish periods of suspension or revocation. Any revocation based on traffic points must be no less than 6 months. A longer period may be imposed on the basis of a person's overall driving record considering the frequency, flagrancy, severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training before driving privileges are reinstated.</P>
                <P>(g) Points assessed against a person will remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 consecutive months. The review of driver records to delete traffic points should be done routinely during records update while recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.</P>
                <P>(h) Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Record entries will remain posted on individual driving records for the following periods of time.</P>
                <P>(1) Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations—3 years.</P>
                <P>(2) Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations—5 years.</P>
                <P>(3) Mandatory revocations—7 years.</P>

                <P>Procedures will be established to ensure prompt notice to the installation law enforcement officer when a person <PRTPAGE P="48"/>assigned to or employed on the installation is being transferred to another installation, being released from military service, or ending employment.</P>
                <P>(a) If persons being transferred to a new installation have valid points or other entries on the driving records, the law enforcement officer will forward the records to the law enforcement officer of the gaining installation. Gaining installation law enforcement officers must coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any existing suspension or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons being transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in § 634.46 (g).</P>
                <P>(b) Driving records of military personnel being discharged or released from active duty will be retained on file for 2 years and then destroyed. In cases of immediate reenlistment, change of officer component or military or civilian retirement when vehicle registration is continued, the record will remain active.</P>
                <P>(c) Driving records of civilian personnel terminating employment will be retained on file for 2 years and then destroyed.</P>
                <P>(d) Driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other entries will be forwarded to the sponsor's gaining installation in the same manner as for service members. At the new installation, records will be analyzed and made available temporarily to the sponsor's unit commander or supervisor for review.</P>
                <P>(e) Driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges will be retained. Points accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or chargeable accidents will not be deleted from driver records except per § 634.46 (g) and (h).</P>
                <P>(f) Army users will comply with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section by mailing the individual's DA Form 3626 to the gaining installation provost marshal.</P>

                <P>This subpart provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:</P>
                <P>(a) The interests of the Services and DLA in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle traffic movement.</P>
                <P>(b) The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 634.49</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Standards for impoundment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) POVs should not be impounded unless the vehicles clearly interfere with ongoing operations or movement of traffic, threaten public safety or convenience, are involved in criminal activity, contain evidence of criminal activity, or are stolen or abandoned.</P>
                <P>(b) The impoundment of a POV would be inappropriate when reasonable alternatives to impoundment exist.</P>
                <P>(1) Attempts should be made to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed.</P>
                <P>(2) The vehicle may be moved a short distance to a legal parking area and temporarily secured until the owner is found.</P>
                <P>(3) Another responsible person may be allowed to drive or tow the POV with permission from the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. In this case, the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle will be informed that law enforcement personnel are not responsible for safeguarding the POV.</P>
                <P>(c) Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:</P>
                <P>(1) The POV is illegally parked—</P>
                <P>(i) On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked, and interferes with the orderly flow of traffic.</P>

                <P>(ii) On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a cross-walk, on a railroad track, in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway, so that the vehicle interferes <PRTPAGE P="49"/>with operations or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public. An example would be a vehicle parked within 15 feet of a fire hydrant or blocking a properly marked driveway of a fire station or aircraft-alert crew facility.</P>
                <P>(iii) When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place (installation theater, club, dining hall, hospital, and other facility).</P>
                <P>(iv) In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with proper signs.</P>
                <P>(2) The POV interferes with—</P>
                <P>(i) Street cleaning or snow removal operations and attempts to contact the owner have been unsuccessful.</P>
                <P>(ii) Emergency operations during a natural disaster or fire or must be removed from the disaster area during cleanup operations.</P>
                <P>(3) The POV has been used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.</P>
                <P>(4) The owner or person in charge has been apprehended and is unable or unwilling to arrange for custody or removal.</P>
                <P>(5) The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public roadways.</P>
                <P>(6) The POV is disabled by a traffic incident and the operator is either unavailable or physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.</P>
                <P>(7) Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.</P>

                <P>(a) Impounded POVs may be towed and stored by either the Services and DLA or a contracted wrecker service depending on availability of towing services and the local commander's preference.</P>
                <P>(b) The installation commander will designate an enclosed area on the installation that can be secured by lock and key for an impound lot to be used by the military or civilian wrecker service. An approved impoundment area belonging to the contracted wrecker service may also be used provided the area assures adequate accountability and security of towed vehicles. One set of keys to the enclosed area will be maintained by the installation law enforcement officer or designated individual.</P>
                <P>(c) Temporary impoundment and towing of POVs for violations of the installation traffic code or involvement in criminal activities will be accomplished under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 634.51</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Procedures for impoundment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Unattended POVs.</E> (1) DD Form 2504 (Abandoned Vehicle Notice) will be conspicuously placed on POVs considered unattended. This action will be documented by an entry in the installation law enforcement desk journal or blotter.</P>
                <P>(2) The owner will be allowed 3 days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle before impoundment action is initiated. If the vehicle has not been removed after 3 days, it will be removed by the installation towing service or the contracted wrecker service. If a contracted wrecker service is used, a DD Form 2505 (Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization) will be completed and issued to the contractor by the installation law enforcement office.</P>
                <P>(3) After the vehicle has been removed, the installation law enforcement officer or the contractor will complete DD Form 2506 (Vehicle Impoundment Report) as a record of the actions taken.</P>
                <P>(i) An inventory listing personal property will be done to protect the owner, law enforcement personnel, the contractor, and the commander.</P>
                <P>(ii) The contents of a closed container such as a suitcase inside the vehicle need not be inventoried. Such articles should be opened only if necessary to identify the owner of the vehicle or if the container might contain explosives or otherwise present a danger to the public. Merely listing the container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.</P>
                <P>(iii) Personal property must be placed in a secure area for safekeeping.</P>

                <P>(4) DD Form 2507 (Notice of Vehicle Impoundment) will be forwarded by certified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the impoundment action, and request information concerning <PRTPAGE P="50"/>the owner's intentions pertaining to the disposition of the vehicle.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.</E> (1) When the POV is to be held for evidentiary purposes, the vehicle should remain in the custody of the applicable Service or DLA until law enforcement purposes are served.</P>
                <P>(2) Recovered stolen POVs will be released to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(3) A POV held on request of other authorities will be retained in the custody of the applicable Service or DLA until the vehicle can be released to such authorities.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Search incident to impoundment based on criminal activity.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Search of a POV in conjunction with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:</P>
                <P>(a) The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. A property search related to an investigation of criminal activity should not be conducted without search authority unless the item to be seized is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in doubt, proper search authority should be obtained before searching.</P>
                <P>(b) The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during either a traffic or criminal incident, or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause exists to seize the vehicle. This situation could also arise during cases of intoxicated driving or traffic accidents in which the operator is present but incapacitated or otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. If danger exists to the police or public or if there is risk of loss or destruction of evidence, an investigative type search of the vehicle may be conducted without search authority.

                <SECTNO>§ 634.53</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Disposition of vehicles after impoundment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If a POV is impounded for evidentiary purposes, the vehicle can be held for as long as the evidentiary or law enforcement purpose exists. The vehicle must then be returned to the owner without delay unless directed otherwise by competent authority.</P>
                <P>(b) If the vehicle is unclaimed after 120 days from the date notification was mailed to the last known owner or the owner released the vehicle by properly completing DD Form 2505, the vehicle will be disposed of by one of the following procedures:</P>
                <P>(1) Release to the lienholder, if known.</P>
                <P>(2) Processed as abandoned property in accordance with DOD 4160.21-M.</P>
                <P>(i) Property may not be disposed of until diligent effort has been made to find the owner; or the heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the owner.</P>
                <P>(ii) The diligent effort to find one of those mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section shall begin not later than 7 days after the date on which the property comes into custody or control of the law enforcement agency.</P>
                <P>(iii) The period for which this effort is continued may not exceed 45 days.</P>
                <P>(iv) If the owner or those mentioned in § 634.52 are determined, but not found, the property may not be disposed of until the expiration of 45 days after the date when notice, giving the time and place of the intended sale or other disposition, has been sent by certified or registered mail to that person at his last known address.</P>
                <P>(v) When diligent effort to determine those mentioned in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section is unsuccessful, the property may be disposed of without delay, except that if it has a fair market value of more than $500, the law enforcement official may not dispose of the property until 45 days after the date it is received at the storage point.</P>
                <P>(c) All contracts for the disposal of abandoned vehicles must comply with 10 U.S.C. 2575.</P>

                <P>The proponent of this part is the Provost Marshal General. The proponent has the authority to approve exceptions or waivers to this Part that are consistent with controlling law and regulations. In distributing information on juvenile victims or subjects, the installation Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office will ensure that only individuals with a need to know of the personally identifiable information (PII) of a juvenile are provided the identifying information on the juvenile. For example, a community commander is authorized to receive pertinent information on juveniles under their jurisdiction. When a Law Enforcement Report identifying juvenile offenders must be provided to multiple commanders or supervisors, the FOIA Office must sanitize each report to withhold juvenile information not pertaining to that commander's area of responsibility.</P>

                <P>(a) Military police records are unclassified except when they contain national security information as defined in AR 380-5 (Available at <E T="03">http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r380_5.pdf</E>), Department of the Army Information Security Program.</P>
                <P>(b) Military police records will also be released to Federal, state, local or foreign law enforcement agencies as prescribed by 32 CFR part 505, The Army Privacy Program. Expanded markings will be applied to these records.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Special requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Certain PII is protected in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as implemented by 32 CFR part 310, DoD Privacy Program, 32 CFR part 505, The Army Privacy Program, and OMB guidance defining PII.</P>
                <P>(b) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3), when an Army activity asks an individual for his or her PII that will be maintained in a system of records, the activity must provide the individual with a Privacy Act Statement (PAS). A PAS notifies individuals of the authority, purpose, and use of the collection, whether the information is mandatory or voluntary, and the effects of not providing all or any part of the requested information.</P>

                <P>(c) Army law enforcement personnel performing official duties often require an individual's PII, including SSN, for identification purposes. This PII can be used to complete law enforcement reports and records. In addition to Executive Order 9397, as amended by Executive Order 13478, the solicitation of the SSN is authorized by paragraph 2.c.(2) of DoD Instruction 1000.30, “Reduction of Social Security Number (SSN) Use Within DoD” (available at <E T="03">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/100030p.pdf</E>). The purpose is to provide commanders and law enforcement officials with means by which information may accurately be identified. The SSN is used as an additional/alternate means of identification to facilitate filing and retrieval. The following procedures will be used for identification:</P>

                <P>(1) Retired military personnel are required to produce their Common Access Card or DD Form 2 (Ret) (U.S. Armed Forces of the United States <PRTPAGE P="54"/>General Convention Identification Card), or other government issued identification, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(2) Family members of sponsors will be requested to produce their DD Form 1173 (Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card). Information contained thereon (for example, the sponsor's SSN) will be used to verify and complete applicable sections of law enforcement reports and related forms.</P>
                <P>(3) Non-Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, including military family members and those whose status is unknown, will be advised of the provisions of the Privacy Act Statement when requested to disclose their PII, including SSN, as required.</P>

                <P>(d) Notwithstanding the requirement to furnish an individual with a PAS when his or her PII will be maintained in a system of records, AR 340-21, The Army Privacy Program, <E T="03">http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r340_21.pdf,</E> provides that records contained in SORN A0190-45, Military Police Reporting Program Records (MRRP), <E T="03">http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNsIndex/tabid/5915/Article/6066/a0190-45-opmg.aspx,</E> that fall within 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) are exempt from the requirement in 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) to provide a PAS.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Police intelligence/Criminal information.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The purpose of gathering police intelligence is to identify individuals or groups of individuals in an effort to anticipate, prevent, or monitor possible criminal activity. Police intelligence aids criminal investigators in developing and investigating criminal cases. 32 CFR part 633 designates the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) as having the primary responsibility to operate a criminal intelligence program. Criminal Intelligence will be reported through the Army Criminal Investigation and Criminal Intelligence (ACI2) System and other criminal intelligence products. The crimes listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(9) of this section, as well as the reportable incidents, behavioral threat indicators, and other matters of counterintelligence interest specified by AR 381-12, Threat Awareness and Reporting Program, (available at <E T="03">http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r381_12.pdf</E>) will be reported to the nearest Army counterintelligence office.</P>

                <P>(9) Unauthorized or intentional disclosure of classified info.</P>
                <P>(b) Information on persons and organizations not affiliated with DoD may not normally be acquired, reported, processed or stored. Situations justifying acquisition of this information include, but are not limited to—</P>
                <P>(1) Theft, destruction, or sabotage of weapons, ammunition, equipment facilities, or records belonging to DoD units or installations.</P>
                <P>(2) Protection of Army installations and activities from potential threat.</P>
                <P>(3) Information received from the FBI, state, local, or international law enforcement agencies which directly pertains to the law enforcement mission and activity of the installation Provost Marshal Office/Directorate of Emergency Services (PMO/DES), Army Command (ACOM), Army Service Component Command (ASCC) or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) PMO/DES, or that has a clearly identifiable military purpose and connection. A determination that specific information may not be collected, retained or disseminated by intelligence activities does not indicate that the information is automatically eligible for collection, retention, or dissemination under the provisions of this part.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Sex Offenders on US Army Installations.</E> Garrison Commander's responsibilities: Garrison Commanders will ensure that sex offenders, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section that reside or are employed on an Army Installation register with the installation PM/DES. This includes service members, civilian employees, accompanying dependent family members, and contractors subject to the incorporation of the sex offender registration requirement into the contract.</P>
                <P>(b) Sex offender is defined as:</P>

                <P>(1) Any person, including but not limited to a Service member, Service member's family member, Civilian employee, Civilian employee's family member, or contractor, who either is registered or required to register as a <PRTPAGE P="56"/>sex offender by any law, regulation or policy of the United States, the Department of Defense, the Army, a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, America Samoa, The Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, or a Federally recognized Indian tribe. This definition is not limited to persons convicted for felony sex offenses but includes all persons who are registered or required to register as a sex offender regardless of the classification of their offenses, including felonies, misdemeanors, and offenses not classified as a felony or misdemeanor.</P>

                <P>(2) The persons who are sex offenders as defined in paragraph (b)(1) include those convicted by a foreign government of an offense equivalent or closely analogous to a covered offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice as provided in AR 27-10, Military Justice (available at <E T="03">http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r27_10.pdf</E>), Chapter 24.” See 42 U.S.C. 16911(5)(B) and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, The National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, Final Guidelines, 73 FR 38030, 38050-1 (July 2, 2008) for guidelines and standards. Contact the servicing Office of the Staff Judge Advocate for assistance in interpreting or applying this provision.</P>

                <P>(c) Sex Offender Registration Requirements. Sex offenders, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must register with the installation PMO/DES within three working days of first arriving on an installation. Sex offenders must provide the installation PMO/DES with evidence of the qualifying conviction. The PMO/DES will enter the registering sex offender's conviction information on a Raw Data File as an information entry into the Army's Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) with the state the sex offender was convicted, date of conviction, and results of conviction, to include length of time required to register and any specific court ordered restrictions. Registration with the PMO/DES does not relieve sex offenders of their legal obligation to comply with applicable state and local registration requirements for the state in which they reside, work, or attend school (see, AR 190-47 (available at <E T="03">http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r190_47.pdf</E>), chapter 14 and AR 27-10 (available at <E T="03">http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r27_10.pdf</E>), chapter 24). Registration with the state is also required under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 U.S.C. 16901 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and implemented by AR 27-10 (Available at <E T="03">http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r27_10.pdf</E>), Military Justice, and DoDI 1325.7 (Available at <E T="03">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/132507p.pdf</E>). In addition, upon assignment, reassignment, or change of address, sex offenders will inform the installation PM/DES within three working days. Failure to comply with registration requirements is punishable under Federal or State law and/or under the UCMJ. “State” in this paragraph includes any jurisdiction listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in which a sex offender is required to register.</P>
                <P>(d) Installation PMOs and DESs will maintain and update a monthly roster of current sex offenders names and provide it to the Sexual Assault Review Board; the Army Command PM and DES and the garrison commander.</P>
                <P>(e) Installation PMs and DESs will complete the following procedures for all other sex offenders required to register on the installation—</P>
                <P>(1) Complete a Raw Data File as an information entry into ALERTS.</P>
                <P>(2) Ensure the sex offender produces either evidence of the qualifying conviction or the sex offender registration paperwork in order to complete the narrative with the state in which the sex offender was convicted, date of conviction, and results of conviction, to include length of time required to register and any specific court ordered restrictions.</P>
                <P>(f) DoD civilians, contractors, and family members that fail to register at the installation PMO/DES are subject to a range of administrative sanctions, including but not limited to a complete or limited bar to the installation and removal from military housing.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Collection of deoxyribonucleic acid.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Army Law Enforcement (LE) personnel will collect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) pursuant to DoDI 5505.14 (available at <E T="03">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/550514p.pdf</E>), DNA Collection Requirements for Criminal Investigations. Per this subpart, a sample of an individual's DNA is to allow for positive identification and to provide or generate evidence to solve crimes through database searches of potentially matching samples. DNA samples will not be collected from juveniles.</P>

                <P>(b) Army LE personnel will obtain a DNA sample from a civilian in their control at the point it is determined there is probable cause to believe the detained person violated a Federal statute equivalent to the offenses identified in DoDI 5505.11 (available at <E T="03">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/550511p.pdf</E>), Fingerprint Card and Final Disposition Report Submission Requirements, and 32 CFR part 310, Department of Defense Privacy Program, except for the listed violations that are exclusively military offenses. For the purposes of this rule, DNA shall be taken from all civilian drug offenders, except those who are arrested or detained for the offenses of simple possession and personal use.</P>
                <P>(1) When Army LE personnel make a probable cause determination concerning a civilian not in their control, Army LE personnel are not required to collect DNA samples. Likewise, Army LE personnel are not required to obtain DNA samples when another LE agency has, or will, obtain the DNA.</P>
                <P>(2) Army LE personnel will use the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) DNA kit which includes a DNA sample card and the USACIL DNA database collection eform. Army LE personnel will forward civilian DNA samples to the USACIL. Army LE personnel will document, in the appropriate case file, when civilian LE agencies handle any aspect of the DNA processing and whether the civilian LE agency forwarded the DNA sample to the FBI laboratory.</P>

Former Soldiers and civilians from whom DNA samples have been taken, but who were not convicted of any offense giving rise to the collection of DNA, do not submit requests to have their DNA record expunged through installation PMO/DES channels. To request expungement of DNA records for civilians pursuant to Sections 14132 of title 42, United States Code, the requestor or legal representative must submit a written request to: FBI, Laboratory Division, 2501 Investigation Parkway, Quantico, VA 22135, Attention: Federal Convicted Offender Program Manager.</P>

                <P>(3) A using organization may maintain information from military police records in their system of records, if approval is obtained from the originating law enforcement agency. This information may include reference to a military police record (for example, Law Enforcement Report number or date of offense), a summary of information contained in the record, or the entire military police record. When a user includes a military police record in its system of records, the originating law enforcement agency will delete portions from that record to protect special investigative techniques, maintain confidentiality, preclude compromise of an investigation, and protect other law enforcement interests.</P>

                <P>(3) Coordination will be completed with the local USACIDC activity to ensure that the release will not interfere with a criminal investigation in progress or affect final disposition of an investigation.</P>

                <P>(4) If it is determined that a portion of the report, or the report in its entirety will not be released, the request to include a copy of the Military Police Report or other military police records will be forwarded to the Director, USACRC, ATTN: CICR-FP, 27130 Telegraph Road, Quantico, VA 22134. The requestor will be informed that their <PRTPAGE P="59"/>request has been sent to the Director, USACRC, and provided the mailing address for the USACRC. When forwarding FOIA requests, the outside of the envelope will be clearly marked “FOIA REQUEST.”</P>
                <P>(5) A partial release of information by an installation FOIA Office is permissible when it is acceptable to the requester. (An example would be the redaction of a third party's social security number, home address, and telephone number, as permitted by law). If the requester agrees to the redaction of exempt information, such cases do not constitute a denial. If the requester insists on the entire report, a copy of the report and the request for release will be forwarded to the Director, USACRC. There is no requirement to coordinate such referrals at the installation level. The request will simply be forwarded to the Director, United States Army Crime Records Center (USACRC) for action.</P>
                <P>(6) Requests for military police records that have been forwarded to USACRC and are no longer on file at the installation PMO/DES will be forwarded to the Director, USACRC for processing.</P>

The burden of proof is on the individual to substantiate the request. Requests to delete a person's name from the title block will be granted only if it is determined that there is not probable cause to believe that the individual committed the offense for which he or she is listed as a subject. It is emphasized that the decision to list a person's name in the title block of a police report is an investigative determination that is independent of whether or not subsequent judicial, non-judicial or administrative action is taken against the individual.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Domestic violence.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Responding to incidents of domestic violence requires a coordinated effort by LE, medical, and social work personnel, to include sharing information and records as permitted by law and regulation. AR 608-18, Chapter 3, contains additional information about domestic violence and protective orders. AR 608-18, Glossary, Section II refers to domestic violence as including the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force or violence against a person or a violation of a lawful order issued for the protection of a person, who is:</P>
                <P>(1) A current or former spouse;</P>
                <P>(2) A person with whom the abuser shares a child in common; or</P>
                <P>(3) A current or former intimate partner with whom the abuser shares or has shared a common domicile.</P>
                <P>(b) All domestic violence incidents will be reported to the local installation PMO/DES.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Protection Orders.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A DD Form 2873, Military Protective Order (MPO) is a written lawful order issued by a commander that orders a Soldier to avoid contact with those persons identified in the order. MPOs may be used to facilitate a “cooling-off” period following domestic violence and sexual assault incidents, to include incidents involving children. The commander should provide a written copy of the order within 24 hours of its issuance to the person with whom the member is ordered not to have contact and to the installation LE activity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial notification.</E> In the event a MPO is issued against a Soldier and any individual involved in the order does not reside on a Army installation at any time during the duration of the MPO, the installation PMO/DES will notify the appropriate civilian authorities (local magistrate courts, family courts, and local police) of:</P>
                <P>(1) The issuance of the protective order;</P>
                <P>(2) The individuals involved in the order;</P>
                <P>(3) Any change made in a protective order;</P>
                <P>(4) The termination of the protective order.</P>
                <P>(c) A Civilian Protective Order (CPO) is an order issued by a judge, magistrate or other authorized civilian official, ordering an individual to avoid contact with his or her spouse or children. Pursuant to the Armed Forces Domestic Security Act, 10 U.S.C. 1561a, a CPO has the same force and effect on a military installation as such order has within the jurisdiction of the court that issued the order.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Establishing Memoranda of Understanding.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Coordination between military law enforcement personnel and local civilian law enforcement personnel is essential to improve information sharing, especially concerning investigations, arrests, and prosecutions involving military personnel. PM/DES or other law enforcement officials shall seek to establish formal Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with their civilian counterparts to establish or improve the flow of information between their agencies, especially in instances involving military personnel. MOUs can be used to clarify jurisdictional issues for the investigation of incidents, to define the mechanism whereby local law enforcement reports involving active duty service members will be forwarded to the appropriate installation law enforcement office, to encourage the local law enforcement agency to refer victims of domestic violence to the installation Family Advocacy office or victim advocate, and to foster cooperation and collaboration between the installation law enforcement agency and local civilian agencies.</P>

                <P>(b) Installation commanders are authorized to contract for local, state, or <PRTPAGE P="62"/>federal law enforcement services (enforcement of civil and criminal laws of the state) from civilian police departments. (Section 120 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1976). Section 120(a) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1976 authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to contract with States and their political subdivisions for the purpose of obtaining increased law enforcement services at water resource development projects under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army to meet needs during peak visitation periods.</P>
                <P>(c) MOUs will address the following issues at a minimum:</P>
                <P>(1) A general statement of the purpose of the MOU.</P>
                <P>(2) An explanation of jurisdictional issues that affect respective responsibilities to and investigating incidents occurring on and off the installation. This section should also address jurisdictional issues when a civilian order of protection is violated on military property (see 10 U.S.C. 1561a).</P>
                <P>(3) Procedures for responding to incidents that occur on the installation involving a civilian alleged offender.</P>
                <P>(4) Procedures for local law enforcement to immediately (within 4 hours) notify the installation law enforcement office of incidents/investigations involving service members.</P>
                <P>(5) Procedures for transmitting incident/investigation reports and other law enforcement information involving active duty service members from local civilian law enforcement agencies to the installation law enforcement office.</P>
                <P>(6) Notification that a Solider is required to register as a sex offender either as the result of military judicial proceedings or civilian judicial proceedings.</P>
                <P>(7) Procedures for transmitting civilian protection orders (CPOs) issued by civilian courts or magistrates involving active duty service members from local law enforcement agencies to the installation law enforcement office.</P>

                <P>(9) Procedures for transmitting military protection orders (MPOs) from the installation law enforcement office to the local civilian law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the area in which any person named in the order resides.</P>
                <P>(10) Designation of the title of the local law enforcement agency recipient of domestic violence and CPO information from the installation law enforcement agency.</P>
                <P>(11) Respective responsibilities for providing information to victims regarding installation resources when either the victim or the alleged offender is an active duty service member.</P>
                <P>(12) Sharing of information and facilities during the course of an investigation in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (see 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7)).</P>

USACIDC is the Army's eGuardian program manager.</P>

                <P>(b) eGuardian is the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) sensitive-but-unclassified web-based platform for reporting, and in some instances, sharing, suspicious activity and threat related information with other federal, state, tribal, and territorial law enforcement and force protection entities. Information entered into eGuardian by the Army may be either shared with all eGuardian participants or reported directly to the FBI. All information entered into eGuardian by the Army will comply with the policy framework for the system and any existing agency agreements, which incorporate privacy protections. Analysis of SARs will assist CRIMINTEL analysts and commanders in mitigating potential threats and vulnerabilities, and developing annual threat assessments.<PRTPAGE P="63"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) Any concerned soldier or citizen can submit a SAR to the nearest installation PMO/DES, CI or CID office. The receiving office will then be responsible for reviewing the information and determining whether it is appropriate for submission into eGuardian.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Military Police Investigators (MPI) and Department of the Army Civilian (DAC) detectives/investigators fulfill a special need for an investigative element within the military police to investigate many incidents, complaints, and matters not within U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) jurisdiction, but which cannot be resolved immediately through routine military police operations. Investigative personnel are assets of the installation or activity commander, under the supervision of the <PRTPAGE P="64"/>local provost marshal. USACIDC elements will provide investigative assistance in the form of professional expertise, laboratory examinations, polygraph examinations, or any other assistance requested which does not distract from the USACIDC mission of investigating serious crimes. A spirit of cooperation and close working relationship is essential between USACIDC and the provost marshal office in order to accomplish the mission and project a professional police image.</P>
                <P>(b) Creation of a formalized investigation program does not constitute the establishment of a dual “detective” force. The separation of investigative responsibilities is very distinct. The MPI Program is neither a career program nor a separate Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). Individuals in the MPI Program are specially selected, trained, and experienced military or civilian men and women performing traditional military police functions. Military personnel are identified by their additional skill identifiers (ASI V5) and may be employed in any assignment appropriate to their grade and MOS.</P>
                <P>(c) The provost marshal may authorize wearing of civilian clothing for the MPI investigative mission.</P>
                <P>(d) MPI and DAC detective/investigator personnel must be familiar with and meet the requirements of Army Regulation (AR) 190-14 (Carrying of Firearms and Use of Force for Law Enforcement and Security Duties).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use of MPI and DAC Detectives/Investigators.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Only those matters requiring investigative development will be referred to the MPI for investigation. Provost marshals will develop procedures to determine which incidents will be referred to the MPI for completion and which will be retained and completed by uniformed MP personnel. Except as otherwise provided, MPI and DAC detectives/investigators will normally be employed in the following investigations:</P>
                <P>(a) Offenses for which the maximum punishment listed in the Table of Maximum Punishment, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 2002 is confinement for 1 year or less. Provisions of the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act will also be considered when assigning cases to MPI. The same punishment criteria apply.</P>
                <P>(b) Property-related offenses when the value is less than $1,000 provided the property is not of a sensitive nature, such as government firearms, ammunition, night vision devices, or controlled substances.</P>
                <P>(c) Offenses involving use and/or possession of non-narcotic controlled substances when the amounts are indicative of personal use only. Military police will coordinate with the local USACIDC element in making determinations of “personal use”. MPI and DAC detectives/investigators may be employed in joint MPI/USACIDC drug suppression teams; however, the conduct of such operations and activities remain the responsibility of USACIDC. When employed under USACIDC supervision, MPI and DAC detectives/investigators may also be utilized to make controlled buys of suspected controlled substances.</P>
                <P>(d) Activities required for the security and protection of persons and property under Army control, to include support of Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards as prescribed in AR 190-24. If MPI detect a crime-conducive condition during the course of an investigation, the appropriate physical security activity will be promptly notified. Crime-conducive conditions will also be identified in military police reports.</P>
                <P>(e) Allegations against MP personnel, when not within the investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.</P>
                <P>(f) Offenses committed by juveniles, when not within the investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.</P>
                <P>(g) Gang or hate crime related activity, when not within the investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Military Police and the USACIDC.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The military police or the USACIDC are authorized to investigate allegations of criminal activity occurring on the installation. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to conflict with or otherwise undermine the delineation of investigative responsibilities between the military police and the USACIDC as set forth in AR 195-2.</P>
                <P>(b) When investigative responsibility is not clearly defined, and the matter cannot be resolved between military police investigations supervisors and USACIDC duty personnel, or between military police investigations supervisors and unit commanders, the provost marshal will be informed and will resolve the matter with the appropriate USACIDC activity commander/Special Agent in Charge (SAC) or unit commander.</P>
                <P>(c) The control and processing of a crime scene and the collection and preservation of the evidence are the exclusive responsibilities of the investigator or supervisor in charge of the crime scene when the military police have investigative responsibility. To prevent the possible loss or destruction of evidence, the investigator or supervisor in charge of the crime scene is authorized to exclude all personnel from the scene. The exercise of this authority in a particular case may be subject to the requirement to preserve human life and the requirement for continuing necessary operations and security. These should be determined in conjunction with the appropriate commander and, where applicable, local host country law enforcement authorities.</P>
                <P>(d) Unit commanders should consult with the installation provost marshal concerning all serious incidents. Examples of incidents appropriate for investigation at the unit level include simple assaults not requiring hospitalization and not involving a firearm, or wrongful damage to property of a value under $1,000. Other incidents should be immediately referred to the installation provost marshal.</P>
                <P>(e) The military police desk is the official point of contact for initial complaints and reports of offenses. The provisions of AR 190-45 are to be followed for all military police records, reports, and reporting.</P>
                <P>(1) When incidents are reported directly to a USACIDC field element, USACIDC may either direct the reporting person to the MP desk or report the incident to the MP desk themselves.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon receipt of the complaint or report of offense, the MP desk will dispatch an available patrol to the scene of the incident. The patrol will take appropriate measures to include locating the complainant, witnesses, suspects, and victims, apprehending offenders, securing the crime scene, rendering emergency assistance, determining and reporting to the MP desk, by the most expeditious means possible, the appropriate activity having investigative responsibility.</P>
                <P>(f) In those cases in which the USACIDC has an ongoing investigation (typically fraud and narcotics matters), they may delay notification to the military police to avoid compromising their investigation.</P>
                <P>(g) Procedures will be developed to ensure mutual cooperation and support between MPI, DAC detectives/investigators and USACIDC elements at each investigative level; however, MPI, DAC detectives/investigators and USACIDC personnel will remain under command and control of their respective commanders at all times.</P>
                <P>(1) With the concurrence of the commander concerned, MPI and DAC detectives/investigators may provide assistance to USACIDC whenever elements assume responsibility for an investigation from MPI.</P>
                <P>(2) When requested by a USACIDC region, district, or the special agent-in-charge of a resident agency, the provost marshal may provide MPI or DAC detective/investigator assistance to USACIDC on a case-by-case basis or for a specified time period.</P>
                <P>(3) With the concurrence of the appropriate USACIDC commander, CID personnel may be designated to assist MPI or DAC detectives/investigators on a case-by-case basis without assuming control of the investigation.</P>

                <P>(4) Modification of investigative responsibilities is authorized on a local basis if the resources of either USACIDC or the military police cannot <PRTPAGE P="66"/>fully support their investigative workload and suitable alternatives are not available. Such modifications will be by written agreement signed by the provost marshal and the supporting USACIDC commander. Agreements will be in effect for no more than two years unless sooner superseded by mutual agreement.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Police Intelligence.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The purpose of gathering police intelligence is to identify individuals or groups of individuals in an effort to anticipate, prevent, or monitor possible criminal activity. If police intelligence is developed to the point where it factually establishes a criminal offense, an investigation by the military police, (USACIDC) or other investigative agency will be initiated.</P>
                <P>(b) Police intelligence will be actively exchanged between Department of Defense (DOD) law enforcement agencies, military police, USACIDC, local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies. One tool under development by DOD for sharing police intelligence is the Joint Protection Enterprise Network (JPEN). JPEN provides users with the ability to post, retrieve, filter, and analyze real-world events. There are seven reporting criteria for JPEN:</P>
                <P>(1) Non-specific threats;</P>
                <P>(2) Surveillance;</P>

                <P>(a) DOD Directive 5505.9 and AR 190-53 provide policy for the wiretap, investigative monitoring and eavesdrop activities by DA personnel. The recording of telephone communications at MP operations desks is considered to be a form of command center communications monitoring which may be conducted to provide an uncontroversial record of emergency communications. This includes reports of emergencies, analysis of reported information, records of instructions, such as commands issued, warnings received, requests for assistance, and instructions as to the location of serious incidents.</P>
                <P>(b) The following procedures are applicable to the recording of emergency telephone and/or radio communications at MP operations desks within the 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Panama, and Guam.</P>
                <P>(1) All telephones connected to recording equipment will be conspicuously marked “For Official Use Only-connected to recording device” and access to use will be restricted to MP operations desk personnel.</P>
                <P>(2) The connection of voice-recording equipment or private-line service with the telecommunications network will be in accordance with applicable telephone company tariffs which permit direct electrical connection through telephone company recorder-connector equipment. An automatic audible-tone device is not required.</P>
                <P>(3) Official emergency telephone numbers for MP desks will be listed in appropriate command, activity, or installation telephone directories with a statement that emergency conversations will be recorded for accuracy of record purposes. Other forms of pre-warning are not required.</P>
                <P>(4) Recordings, which contain conversations described in this section, will be retained for a period of 60 days. Transcripts may be made for permanent files, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(5) The recording of telephone communications or radio transmissions by MP personnel for other than emergency purposes is prohibited. If an investigator requires the use of electronic surveillance equipment, assistance must be requested from the USACIDC. This policy is established pursuant to Department of Defense directives that limit such activity to the criminal investigative organizations of the Services and DOD.</P>
                <P>(6) Commanders having general courts-martial convening authority will issue written authorizations for the recording of emergency telephone communications at MP operations desks. The letter of authorization will contain specific authority for the type of equipment to be used, the phone numbers identified as emergency lines and instructions limiting recordings to calls received on the phones so designated. One copy of the authorization will be forwarded to the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG), 2800 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-2800.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This regulation sets forth the authority, policy, responsibility, and procedure for making military real estate, under the control of the Department of the Army, available for use by other military departments, Federal agencies, State and local governmental agencies, private organizations or individuals.</P>
                <P>(b) This regulation implements Department of Defense Directives and Instructions (4165 series), which include policies and procedures concerning use of military real estate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This regulation is applicable to Army military real estate, which includes land and improvements thereon and is also referred to as real property.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 643.3</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Authority to grant use of real estate.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3), provides that the Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.</P>
                <P>(b) One of the principal authorities for the use of military real estate for commercial purposes is title 10 U.S.C., section 2667, which authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA), whenever it is considered to be advantageous to the United States, to lease such real or personal property under Army control, which is not for the time needed for public use, upon such terms and conditions as the SA considers will promote the national defense or be in the public interest.</P>
                <P>(c) Grants under statutory authorities cited in this regulation of real property pertaining to river and harbor, water resource development and flood control projects, will be under the policies and general guidelines set forth in this regulation.</P>
                <P>(d) The SA may, under the general administrative powers vested in the office, authorize the use of real estate in the absence of statutory authority, in unusual circumstances, provided the property is not for the time being required for public use, the grant conveys no interest in the real estate and the proposed use will be of a direct benefit to the United States. Under this authority, the right to use real estate may also be granted to other military departments or Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(e) Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, an interest in real estate will not be granted unless authorized by law.</P>
                <P>(f) Other laws authorizing grants for non-Army use of real estate for various purposes and Table of Related Army Regulations are set forth in appendixes A and B, respectively.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Responsibilities of the Chief of Engineers (COE).</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) After it is determined that real estate located in the United States, Puerto Rico, American Virgin Islands and the Panama Canal Zone, is available for non-Army use, the COE, except as otherwise provided in this regulation, is charged with responsibility for arranging for the use of real estate within the scope of this regulation. In the performance of this function, the COE is authorized to obtain such technical assistance from the using service as may be deemed necessary.</P>

                <P>(b) COE has staff responsibility over real estate matters in Guam, American Samoa, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI), and in foreign countries.<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, determinations that real estate is available for non-Army use must be approved by the COE.</P>
                <P>(d) The authority of the COE to grant use of real estate will be delegated, to the extent feasible, to U.S. Army Division and District Engineers (DE).</P>

                <P>(e) The COE is responsible for the granting of temporary use of real estate reported excess to the General Services Administration (GSA), to the extent authorized by regulations issued pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 471, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and as provided in title 10 U.S.C., section 2667(f). The COE is also responsible for supervision and the issuance of instructions covering the granting of use of real estate within the scope of this regulation. Where Army or installation commanders are authorized to grant use of real estate, they are authorized to obtain technical assistance from the appropriate DE.</P>
                <P>(f) In reviewing Army requirements for real estate (AR 405-10), the COE will consider the availability and adequacy of other military or federally-owned real estate to satisfy Army requirements before leasing privately-owned real estate, or renewing existing leases.</P>

                <P>Except as otherwise provided herein, determinations of availability will be approved by the COE or higher authority. MACOMS and special staff agencies are responsible for determining the real estate which can be made available for non-Army use, specifying the authorized uses of the property which will not be incompatible with military requirements for the property, the length of the term and any restrictions to be imposed on the grantee's use. Upon approval of the determination of availability, the real estate grant will be issued by the DE or as otherwise provided in this regulation.</P>

                <P>A report of availability will be prepared by the installation commander or head of the special staff agency, when it is determined that for the time being the real estate is not required for Army use and can be made available, either concurrently with the Army, or exclusively, for use by another military department, by other Federal agencies, by State or local governmental agencies, private organizations or individuals. The installation commander's recommendation will be made as far in advance as possible so as to minimize the time lapse between the determination of availability and the date of use of the property by the grantee. Where real estate suitable for agricultural or grazing purposes is involved, the normal season for planting and grazing should be taken into consideration so that the property may be advertised in a timely manner. A copy of each report will be furnished to the appropriate DE for information. The report of availability will contain the information outlined in appendix C.</P>

                <P>The recommendation that real estate is determined available for non-Army use will be submitted by the installation commander to the major commander for approval, through the echelon of command. The major commander will approve such recommendation and submit it to the appropriate DE for action, except recommendations involving the following actions will be forwarded to the COE:</P>

                <P>Overseas commanders may authorize the use by another military department or a Federal agency of an installation or portion thereof located in designated overseas areas and in foreign countries when the real estate is not for the time needed for Army purposes or its concurrent use for other purposes will not interfere with the mission of the installation and such other use is not inconsistent with the agreement under which the property was acquired. Overseas commanders may also authorize any use of such property which is necessary in the accomplishment of the DA mission for which the property was acquired. All other proposed uses will be coordinated with the United States diplomatic mission in the country involved prior to submission to HQDA (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314, for approval.

                <P>When a military requirement arises for real estate which is being used under a grant of non-Army use, the <PRTPAGE P="75"/>withdrawal of availability will be approved at the same level of command as that required for determining the property available for non-Army use. The office responsible for effecting temporary use of the property should be promptly notified of the withdrawal of availability for non-Army use and the latest date the property will be required for military purposes. Termination of the use will be in accordance with the provisions of the grant unless military necessity requires other action. In order to avoid possible claims for damages and in the interest of good community relations and in furtherance of the Army's leasing program, the grantee will be allowed, when practicable, a reasonable time after notice of revocation, to vacate the premises, remove his property and, if required, restore the premises. In controversial cases, or where a claim for damages or litigation is anticipated, HQDA (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314, will be notified of the circumstances prior to sending notification of termination of the grant to the grantee.</P>

                <P>Commanders will provide general surveillance over areas made available for non-Army use and will advise the DE if and when there are any irregularities. Real estate which is being used for non-military purposes will be inspected at least once each year by the COE, or by his representative, to determine whether grantees or occupants are complyng with the terms of the instruments authorizing use and occupancy, except with respect to easements and licenses for rights-of-way for roads, streets, powerlines, pipelines, underground communication lines and similar facilities. The COE will make compliance inspections for such easements and licenses at least once during each 5-year period. However, the DE will check with installation commanders annually to assure that there are no situations which might need correction prior to the inspection. The installation commander will make interim inspections of all real estate being used for non-military purposes as are necessary for timely observation of the extent of compliance with grant provisions designed to protect and preserve the real estate for military requirements, and will furnish the appropriate DE a copy of a written report of the inspection reflecting findings and recommendations. In order that the grantee's operations not be unreasonably disrupted, the annual compliance inspection made by the DE will be coordinated with the installation commander so that, if feasible, only one inspection will be made. Where necessary, corrective action in accordance with applicable regulations will be taken for the enforcement of the terms of the grant by the responsible officer who granted the use. Overseas commanders are responsible for inspection of real estate under their jurisdiction and necessary corrective action.</P>

                <P>Installation Commanders will maintain constant surveillance over real estate under their jurisdiction to determine whether any of it is excess to requirements, or may be made available for other Army use, or may be made available for use for other than Army purposes and will process such determinations expeditiously in accordance with the provisions of this regulation. From time to time DOD, DA and GSA surveys will be made pursuant to Executive Order 11954, 7 January 1977, which enunciated a uniform policy for the Executive Branch of the Federal Government with respect to the identification of excess and under-utilized real estate (AR 405-70). Real estate for which is retained for future use will be a requirement which will be disposed of in accordance with AR 405-90. Real estate <PRTPAGE P="76"/>which the Army does not currently need but which is retained for future use will be made available to others for use either exclusively or concurrently with the Army. When an installation is in an inactive status, the presumption is that it is available for other military or Federal use or for leasing unless there are cogent reasons that such action should not be taken. The purpose of this rule is to put to beneficial use Federal property, which is not for the time required for its basic use, for the benefit of other Federal agencies, the local economy, or for the benefits accruing to the United States from the income and/or savings of maintenance, protection, repair, or restoration.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Policy—Competition.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The use of real estate under the control of DA for private purposes will be granted only after reasonable efforts have been made to obtain competition for its use, through advertising. Advertising is any method of public announcement intended to aid directly or indirectly in obtaining offers on a competitive basis. Advertising may be accomplished by circulating and posting notices and by paid advertising in newspapers and trade journals. The purpose of seeking competition is to afford all qualified persons equal opportunity to bid for the use of the property, to secure for the Government the benefits which flow from competition, and to prevent criticism that favoritism has been shown by officers or employees of the Government in making public property available for private use. Although the lease of Government real estate to civilians employed by the military departments or officers or enlisted personnel of the Armed Forces is not prohibited by law, it is essential that extreme care be exercised to avoid favoritism or the appearance of favoritism. Generally leases to Federal Government personnel will be granted only after competitive bid under the sealed bid method. The provisions of this paragraph do not affect the authority contained in AR 210-10 and 210-50 for furnishing quarters to civilian employees of DA. Also the provisions of this paragraph do not affect the use of Federal facilities by uniformed personnel as may be otherwise provided for. Other exceptions to the advertising policy are as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) Granting easements, leases and licenses to public agencies and public utilities.</P>
                <P>(b) Granting permits to other Federal agencies.</P>

                <P>(e) COE is authorized to grant a waiver of competition upon a determination that it will promote the national defense or will be in the public interest or upon a determination that competition is impracticable.</P>

                <P>Each lease will be for a period not exceeding five years unless the SA determines that a longer period will promote the national defense or will be in the public interest.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Consideration.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Unless otherwise authorized by this regulation or directed by the SA, the consideration for a lease of real estate will be the appraised fair market rental value. However, the value of the maintenance, protection, repair, or restoration by the lessee of the property leased, or of the entire unit or installation where a substantial part of it is leased, may be accepted as all or part of the consideration. The value of the maintenance, protection, repair or restoration, when added to the amount of the monetary payment to be made by the lessee, must equal the appraised fair market rental value of the property leased.</P>
                <P>(b) Buildings and space may be leased to a State or political subdivision thereof for public school purposes, limited to use for classrooms and closely related academic instructions, through high school level, at no monetary consideration. Where bare land is leased for construction of a school through high school level, the acreage will not exceed criteria established by the appropriate State authority or the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), the rental will be $1 for the term of the lease and any renewal thereof. Leases of bare land will be for a term of 25 years, with an option on tenant's part to renew for another term of 25 years. Real estate may also be leased for educational purposes to public educational institutions at a reduced rental, after consultation with the HEW, and taking into account any benefits accruing to the United States through the use of such property. In any event, the lessee will be required to assume the cost of maintenance, protection, repair, or restoration of the property leased and the administrative costs incident thereto.</P>

                <P>(c) Lease granted for agricultural, grazing, or haying purposes will have attached thereto the land-use regulations furnished by the installation commander specifying the items required to be performed by the lessee as part of the lease obligations. It is the policy of the DA that land leased for agricultural, grazing or haying purposes be returned to the Government in as good or better condition than when initially leased. The land-use regulations will include those activities of maintenance, protection, repair, or restoration of the property leased which the lessee will be required to perform as part or all of the consideration for <PRTPAGE P="81"/>the lease. Generally, an activity will qualify as an offset from rental if it is:</P>
                <P>(1) Performed on the leased premises, or when it constitutes a substantial part of the entire rental unit or installation,</P>
                <P>(2) Of direct benefit to the installation in its authorized current or mobilization mission, as distinguished from desired programs, or in furtherance of the Army's leasing program,</P>
                <P>(3) Generally related to the lessee's use of the leased property. Where all of the above criteria are met, the following activities may be authorized: Control of erosion, conservation of natural resources, and maintenance of the viability of the land for continuing leasing, such as mowing, weed control, seeding, fertilizing, mulching, crop rotation, selected cutting, and soil conservation measures such as terraces, check dams, wells, springs, ponds, title, or open channels or culverts for drainage, firebreaks, inside fencing and cattle guards. Maintenance, protection, repair or restoration of buildings, roads, perimeter fencing, and similar improvements are not authorized as offsets from rental unless the property is leased to and beneficially used by the lessee, or on a rental unit or installation in which the leased premises constitutes a substantial part or as otherwise approved by HQDA (DAEN-REM), Washington, DC 20314. Also, lessee may be required to perform activities in support of recreation and welfare, fish and wildlife, beautification, and esthetic programs and the cost of establishing and maintaining recreation, swimming and fishing areas, wildlife habitats, food plots, and similar activities when the following conditions have been met:</P>
                <P>(1) The activities to be offset are in furtherance of the installation natural resources plan as approved by the MACOM.</P>
                <P>(2) The overall plan for the term of the lease, has been approved by ASA (IL &amp; FM).</P>
                <P>(3) MACOM approval has been obtained for each lease when any activity to be offset exceeds $1,000.</P>
                <FP>Total of the offsets in any year will never exceed the annual rental.</FP>

                <P>Although the statutes authorizing grants of rights of way or easements do not make it mandatory that compensation be paid to the United States, such grants will reserve consideration in an amount equal to the fair market value as established by recognized appraisal practices.

                <P>In easement grants, grantees usually will be required to repair and restore damage done to Government land and improvements and to relocate or replace buildings and other needed facilities rendered useless or less useful by the exercise of the easement rights granted.

                <P>(a) Where the easement grant is to be made at fair market value to entities not entitled to grants of rights of way without charge, the charge for the grant will include the in-place fair market value of the improvements.</P>
                <P>(b) Where the proposed grantee is a State or local Government agency normally granted a right of way without charge under Army policy and the grantee's project is subsidized wholly by an agency of the Federal Government, no charge will be made for the improvements thus lost, since any charge made would not reflect a net return to the Government.</P>
                <P>(c) Where the proposed grantee is a State or local Government agency normally granted a right of way without charge under Army policy, and the grantee's project is not subsidized, or is subsidized only in part, the charge for such improvements removed or destroyed and not replaced will be the salvage value thereof.</P>

Exceptions to this policy will be real property and related services provided to an organization which is solely in the support of the installation's mission. (For example: Space assigned to a FAA air controller on an Army airfield; GAO activity auditing installation programs.) Proceeds which are in excess of the actual operating and maintenance costs of providing the service shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts unless otherwise authorized by law. Reimbursement for utilities and services furnished to the permittee is the responsibility of the officer having immeditate jurisdiction over the real estate. Where the use of real estate by a Federal agency under permit is authorized and the correspondence does not include information regarding charges to be made for the real estate, clarifying information will be obtained from HQDA (DAEN-REM), Washington, DC 20314.</P>

Reimbursement is the responsibility of the DE. Any other officer authorizing such use is responsible for notifying the DE of the non-Army use.</P>

                <P>MACOM may approve local agreements with other Army, DOD, and Reserve elements covering temporary use of existing Army Reserve facilities, <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the DA is reimbursed in proportionate share for the services furnished and that the cost of any alterations that may be desired will be borne by the military service concerned. Although no specific form is prescribed for those operational agreements, the agreements constitute interservice support agreements subject to joint AR 1-35/SECNAV INST 4000.20B/AFR 400.27. Nothing in such joint regulation disallows use of DE outgrants to supplement coverages of interservice support agreements when requested and approved in accordance with this regulation. The terms used in the interservice agreements and/or DE outgrants will be those acceptable to the commands concerned. Agreements, however, which provide for the exclusive use of such property by the Air Force or Navy Reserve, or which involve a transfer of funds between services for other than minor utility services, or which involve an increase in personnel strength, or other complications, will be routed to the appropriate DE for execution of a formal permit.</P>

                <P>Subpart A sets out basic procedures to be followed in planning and scheduling for the acquisition of lands in connection with Military and Civil Works projects. It is not intended to be taken as absolute, without modification, but more as a guide to insure all aspects involved and potential problems are fully considered in planning for the acquisition of additional lands. Proper planning in the initial stages of any project can and should eliminate unnecessary delays during the acquisition phase.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Sections 644.2 through 644.8 describe the authorities and procedures of the Corps of Engineers relating to real estate planning and project authorization for the acquisition of land and interests therein for all water resource projects.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> These sections are applicable to all Division and District Engineers having civil works real estate responsibilities.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">River and harbor and flood control projects</E>—(1) <E T="03">River and Harbor Projects.</E> The Act of Congress approved April 24, 1888 (33 U.S.C. 591) authorizes acquisition of land for river and harbor purposes. These include the construction, operation, maintenance and improvement of both natural and artificial waterways, the construction of locks and dams, dikes, bulkheads, jetties, revetment and other bank protection works, and spoil disposal dikes and retaining structures for construction and maintenance. Unless otherwise specified by Congress, local interests furnish, free of cost to the United States, all lands, easements and rights-of-way required for initial construction, operation and subsequent maintenance. A cash contribution may also be required if enhancement of land values results from disposal of spoil dredged from project areas (ER 1150-2-301 and EM 1120-2-101).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Flood control projects.</E> The Act of Congress approved March 1, 1917 (33 U.S.C. 701) authorizes acquisition of land for flood control purposes, and section 2 of the Act of Congress approved June 28, 1938, as amended (33 U.S.C. 701c-1), authorizes the acquisition of land and interests therein for dam and reservoir projects, channel improvements, and rectification projects for flood control at Federal expense. Dam, reservoir and lake projects are generally constructed entirely at the expense of the United States and are maintained and operated with the use of Federal funds. Local interests are not required to furnish lands, easements and rights-of-way for dam and reservoir projects, unless specifically authorized by law for small reservoirs which provide localized flood protection (EM 1120-2-101). For local flood protection projects, except channel improvement or channel rectification projects authorized by the Flood Control Acts of 1936, 1937 and 1938, local interests must provide, without cost to the United States, all necessary lands, easements, and rights-of-way. They must also hold and save the United States free from damages due to the construction, operation and maintenance of the project, except where such damages are due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its contractors, and maintain and operate all the works after completion, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army. Channel improvement and channel rectification projects authorized by the Acts of 1936, 1937 and 1938 are built entirely at Federal expense and no local cooperation is required. Exceptions to these rules are provided by law in the case of certain specific projects such as hurricane protection, shore protection, beach erosion control or other purposes. As in river and harbor projects, a cash contribution may also be required if enhancement of land values results from disposal of spoil dredged from project areas (ER 1150-2-301 and EM 1120-2-101).</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">The navigational servitude.</E> As a general rule the United States does not acquire interests in real estate which it already possesses or over which jurisdiction is or can be legally exercised. Irrespective of the ownership of the banks and bed of a stream below ordinary high water mark, and irrespective of western water rights under the prior <PRTPAGE P="92"/>appropriation doctrine, no further Federal interest is required for navigation projects in navigable streams below the ordinary high water limit. It is required, therefore, that the acquisition plan consider the extent of the navigational servitude.</P>
                  <P>(1) ER 1165-2-302 contains the practice and procedures regarding navigation.</P>
                  <P>(2) The navigational servitude affects abutting uplands, in that the special site value attributable to their location near a navigable stream is noncompensable. However, this has been partially changed by section 111 of Pub. L. 91-611. In all cases where real property is acquired by the United States for public use in connection with any improvements of rivers, harbors, canals or waterways of the United States, the compensation to be paid shall be the fair market value of such real property based upon all uses to which such real property may reasonably be put, including its highest and best use, any of which uses may be dependent upon access to or utilization of such navigable waters. In cases of partial acquisitions of real property, no depreciation in the value of any remaining real property shall be recognized, and no compensation shall be paid for any severance to the remaining real property which results from loss of or reduction of access from the remaining real property to the navigable waters because of the acquisition of real property or the purposes for which the real property is acquired.</P>

                  <P>(3) Injury to private property within or abutting non-navigable streams is compensable if inflicted in the course of an exercise of the navigation power limited to the navigable mainstream. <E T="03">U.S.</E> v. <E T="03">Kansas City Life Ins. Co.,</E> 339 U.S. 799 (1950), <E T="03">U.S.</E> v <E T="03">Cress,</E> 243 U.S. 316 (1917).</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Buildings.</E> Buildings for human occupancy, as well as other structures which would interfere with the operation of the project, or which would be substantially damaged by inundation, are prohibited below the guide acquisition line unless otherwise specifically approved by the Chief of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Estates.</E> Standard estates for acquisition of land or interests therein are contained in subpart C. Non-standard estates should be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 for approval.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Land to be acquired in fee.</E> All lands necessary for permanent structures, construction areas, public access areas and fish and wildlife purposes will be acquired in fee. No interests need be acquired in areas subject to the Government's right of navigational servitude. Spoil disposal areas may be acquired in fee upon approval of HQDA (DAEN-REA-P).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Lands over which easements are to be acquired.</E> (1) Permanent easements are required for channel improvements, navigation pools, navigation aids, and spoil disposal areas for future maintenance. Requirements for navigation aids should be coordinated by the District Engineer with the local Coast Guard District Commander.</P>
                  <P>(2) Temporary easements may be acquired for temporary disposal of spoil, and temporary construction and borrow areas.</P>
                  <P>(3) In navigation-only projects, the right to permanently flood should be acquired in all lands located within the navigation pool and the right to occasionally flood should be acquired in lands above the pool. However, when the area to be occasionally flooded above the navigation pool consists of a narrow band of land, the right to permanently flood may be taken therein, to avoid acquisition of two different estates from the same ownership, and/or to reduce overall costs of acquisition.</P>

                      <E T="04">Authority:</E> The provisions of this Part 8 issued under Sec. 7, 32 Stat. 389, sec. 14, 53 Stat. 1197; 43 U.S.C. 421, 389.
                    </P>
                    <P>8.0 <E T="03">Acquisition of lands for reservoir projects.</E> Insofar as permitted by law, it is the policy of the Departments of the Interior and of the Army to acquire, as a part of reservoir project construction, adequate interest in lands necessary for the realization of optimum values for all purposes including additional land areas to assure full realization of optimum present and future outdoor recreational and fish and wildlife potentials of each reservoir.</P>
                    <P>8.1 <E T="03">Lands for reservoir construction and operation.</E> The fee title will be acquired to the following:</P>
                    <P>(a) Lands necessary for permanent structures.</P>
                    <P>(b) Lands below the maximum flowage line of the reservoir including lands below a selected freeboard where necessary to safeguard against the effects of saturation, wave action, and bank erosion and to permit induced surcharge operation.</P>
                    <P>(c) Lands needed to provide for public access to the maximum flowage line as described in paragraph 1b, or for operation and maintenance of the project.</P>
                    <P>8.2 <E T="03">Additional lands for correlative purposes.</E> The fee title will be acquired for the following:</P>
                    <P>(a) Such lands as are needed to meet present and future requirements for fish and wildlife as determined pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.</P>
                    <P>(b) Such lands as are needed to meet present and future public requirements for outdoor recreation, as may be authorized by Congress.</P>
                    <P>8.3 <E T="03">Easements.</E> Easements in lieu of fee title may be taken only for lands that meet all of the following conditions:</P>
                    <P>(a) Lands lying above the storage pool.</P>
                    <P>(b) Lands in remote portions of the project area.</P>
                    <P>(c) Lands determined to be of no substantial value for protection or enhancement of fish and wildlife resources, or for public outdoor recreation.</P>
                    <P>(d) It is to the financial advantage of the Government to take easements in lieu of fee title.</P>
                    <P>8.4 <E T="03">Blocking out.</E> Blocking out will be accomplished in accordance with sound real estate practices, for example, on minor sectional subdivision lines; and normally, land will not be acquired to avoid severance damage if the owner will waive such damage.</P>
                    <P>8.5 <E T="03">Mineral rights.</E> Mineral, oil and gas rights will not be acquired except where the development thereof would interfere with project purposes, but mineral rights not acquired will be subordinated to the Government's right to regulate their development in a manner that will not interfere with the primary purposes of the project, including public access.</P>
                    <P>8.6 <E T="03">Buildings.</E> Buildings for human occupancy as well as other structures which would interfere with the operation of the project for any project purpose will be prohibited on reservoir project lands.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Application of joint policy by Corps of Engineers.</E> In order to assure that the water and land areas of reservoirs constructed by the Corps are available to the public, the lands which provide access along the shore of the reservoir will be supplemented at selected locations for concentrated public use. Where projects have either recreation or fish and wildlife, or both, as project purposes, additional lands will be acquired as set out in the authorization and specified in design memoranda. The policy contemplates that the United States own in fee a continuous area of land around the reservoir above the water level to insure ready access along the shore. However, certain exceptions have been adopted, as set forth hereinafter. Under the Joint Policy the Corps will take an adequate interest in lands, including areas required for public access, to accomplish all of the authorized purposes of the project and thereby obtain maximum public benefits therefrom. The statements in the policy which define the land interests to be acquired in particular areas are guidelines in application of policy.</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Land to be acquired in fee.</E> (i) Lands necessary for the dam site, construction areas and permanent structures.</P>

                  <P>(ii) The lands below a guide contour line (guide acquisition line) established <PRTPAGE P="94"/>with a reasonable freeboard allowance above the top pool elevation for storing water for flood control, navigation, power, irrigation, and other purposes, referred to in this paragraph as the “full pool” elevation. In nonurban areas generally, this freeboard allowance will be established to include allowances for induced surcharge operations plus a reasonable additional freeboard to provide for adverse effects of saturation, wave action and bank erosion. Factors such as estimated frequency of occurrence, probable accuracy of estimates, and relocation costs, will be taken into consideration. Where this freeboard does not provide a minimum of 300 feet horizontally from the conservation pool, defined as the top of all planned storage not devoted exclusively to flood control, then the guide acquisition line will be increased to that extent. In the vicinity of urban communities or other areas of highly concentrated developments, the total freeboard allowance between the full pool elevation and the acquisition line may be greater than prescribed for nonurban areas generally, and shall be sufficient to assure that major hazards to life or unusually severe property damages would not result from floods up to the magnitude of the standard project flood. In such circumstances, however, consideration may be given to easements rather than fee acquisition for select sections if found to be in the public interest. However, when the project design provides a high level spillway, the crest of which for economy of construction is substantially higher than the storage elevation required to regulate the reservoir design flood, the upper level of fee acquisition will normally be at least equal to the top elevation of spillway gates or crest elevation of ungated spillway, and may exceed this elevation if necessary to conform with other criteria prescribed herein.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Lands to be acquired for public use, being those reflected in the Recreation Resources Appendix of the Phase I General Design Memorandum (ER 1120-2-400). The Phase I General Design Memorandum is required to be prepared and submitted for approval prior to submission of the Real Estate Design Memorandum.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Lands required for operation and maintenance of the project for:</P>
                  <P>(A) Frequently used operational areas.</P>
                  <P>(B) Clearing and disposition of debris.</P>
                  <P>(C) Maintenance, repair, and restoration.</P>
                  <P>(D) Anticipated erosion.</P>
                  <P>(E) Safeguarding public health, and malaria and mosquito control.</P>
                  <P>(F) Sanitation.</P>

                  <P>(v) Lands specifically authorized by the Congress for recreation and fish and wildlife purpose as defined by the Federal Water Project Recreation Act (Pub. L. 89-72) and Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-624, 16. U.S.C. 661 <E T="03">et seq</E>).</P>
                  <P>(A) All lands to be acquired for fish and wildlife purposes, either mitigation enhancement lands or estates therein required for other project purposes, will be presented in such a way as to distinguish clearly all such lands under each of the separate authorities involved. Specific guidance on fish and wildlife resources is contained in ER 1120-2-400 and ER 1120-2-404.</P>
                  <P>(B) The purpose of Pub. L. 89-72 is to provide a uniform policy with respect to recreation and fish and wildlife benefits and costs of Federal multiple-purpose water resource projects, and for other purposes.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Pub. L. 89-72, as amended by section 77 of Pub. L. 93-251, does, however, create a unique provision relating to local participation in the recreation and fish and wildlife developments in water resource projects. Provisions of that Act, as amended, must be adhered to and contracts for administration of project lands and cost-sharing shall follow the amendments contained in section 77 of Pub. L. 93-251.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Section 3(b) of Pub. L. 89-72 further provides that, notwithstanding the absence of an indication of intent as specified above, lands may be provided in project planning which would preserve the recreation and fish and wildlife potential of the project for <E T="03">subsequent</E> development by local interests. The act prescribes that local interests must within 10 years after initial operation of the project enter into agreements specified above. In the event such agreements are not obtained, the <PRTPAGE P="95"/>proposed facilities cannot be constructed and the Corps may utilize the lands acquired for any lawful purpose within the Corps' jurisdiction or may offer said land for sale to its immediate prior owner or his immediate heirs at its appraised fair market value at the time of disposal. In the event that an agreement with the prior owner or his heirs cannot be reached in 90 days, disposal of the property will ensue pursuant to usual disposal procedures.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The provisions of Pub. L. 89-72, as amended, are construed to apply to planning for projects authorized in 1965 or thereafter. Accordingly, all planning for future projects must be coordinated with local interests as defined in the law and all design memoranda relating to land acquisition or development of recreation or fish and wildlife areas must clearly set forth the potential of the project for such development and the intent of local interests in fulfilling the requirements of this law.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Public Law 89-72, as amended, does not impose a requirement for local participation in all recreation and fish and wildlife areas. Development of recreation areas and planning for fish and wildlife areas will be in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Chapter and related regulations.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Lands for resource preservation and/or enhancement in fulfillment of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852) and Executive Order 11514 will be those approved in the authorizing document and/or those approved in the Recreation Resources Appendix of the General Design memorandum.</P>
                  <P>(vii) Uneconomic remnants required to be purchased in fee under section 301(9) of Pub. L. 91-646.</P>
                  <P>(viii) Recommendations may be made in the Real Estate Design Memorandum to eliminate lands from acquisition located within the approved guide acquisition line but above the guide contour line which are highly developed or devoted to public uses such as parks, golf courses, cemeteries, etc. Also, where for reasons of steep terrain, presence of highways and railroads, severe severance, or for other reasons, sound real estate practice indicates requirement for some adjustments in the area above the guide contour line, recommendations for such adjustments will be included in the real estate design memorandum, or will be subsequently submitted with proposed final real property acquisition lines, for approval of the Division Engineer in accordance with § 644.7.</P>
                  <P>(ix) Lands which will be covered by any sediment delta that is expected to form as the result of aggradation of streams draining into the reservoir. The estimate of this area shall be based upon the probable sediment inflow for a period at least equal to the economic life of the project.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Lands over which easements are to be Acquired.</E> (i) Lands in reservoir areas of flood-control-only projects, which do not provide conservation pools, except as required for public access.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Lands required for a relatively short time for temporary structures or for use during the construction period only.</P>

                  <P>(iii) The Joint Policy of 1962 provides that flowage easements <E T="03">may</E> be acquired in reservoir projects if <E T="03">all</E> four conditions of Section 8-3 of the Joint Policy are met. For the purposes of land acquisition, to distinguish between fee and flowage easement “remote portions of the project area” as referred to in Section 8-3 of the Joint Policy are defined as those lands lying upstream from the conservation pool (the top elevation of all storage other than that devoted exclusively to flood control use) on the main stream and all significant tributaries thereof.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Lands downstream from the dam and required only for operational purposes.</P>
                  <P>(v) In flood control projects which do not have conservation pools, the right to occasionally flood should be acquired in all lands, except that the right to permanently flood should be acquired in those lands which may be subjected to permanent flooding, as in the case of a trash pool.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Levees in lieu of acquisition.</E> Where construction of levees or flood walls and necessary associated facilities for protection of lands and properties located within potential flowage limits of a reservoir is proposed in lieu of acquisition of fee title or easements over <PRTPAGE P="96"/>such properties, the protective structures shall meet the following minimum functional requirements:</P>
                  <P>(i) In urban communities or other areas of highly concentrated developments where overtopping of levees would result in major hazards to life or unusually severe property damage under anticipated future conditions, levee grades and designs shall be adequate to withstand without failure the occurrence of the standard project flood, assuming the reservoir is filled to highest level that is reasonably likely to prevail at the beginning of such a flood.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under circumstances where it can be reasonably shown that possible overtopping of protective levees or flood walls as proposed would not result in unusual hazards to life or major property damage, levee grades shall be as high as economically practicable in consideration of apparent risks and costs involved, and flowage easements or other appropriate assurances from local interests shall be obtained insofar as necessary to protect the Government in the event the protective structures are overtopped.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Mineral acquisition practices.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> The procedure of the Corps of Engineers in acquiring the necessary land or interests therein to accommodate projects authorized by the Congress is to permit the reservation of the minerals in the land, unless the reservation is inimical to the operation of the project. In all cases wherein a reservation is permitted, the mineral interests are subordinated to the primary project purposes, including public access and preservation of environmental quality.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The multiplicity of ownerships in mineral interests, the variety of minerals and the different methods of mineral exploration, recovery and production make it impracticable to define in advance specific guidelines concerning the reservation of mineral interests and their subordination to primary project purposes in any given project. The initial planning documents, real estate design memoranda, and master plans will fully discuss and consider the extent of acquisition and/or reservation of mineral interests.</P>
                  <P>(2) Generally fee title to all subsurface interests will be acquired in areas required for all structures, areas required for project operations and public use including access, and in areas where the value of the subsurface interests is nominal. Reservation of coal, oil, gas and other minerals will be permitted whenever any aspect of mineral development will not interfere with project purposes. The reservation of mineral rights will be predicated upon the Government's right to so regulate their development as to eliminate any interference with project purposes and to minimize any adverse impact on the environment including aesthetic values.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of minerals.</E> (1) When it has been determined that the reservation of minerals will not interfere with the purposes of the project, the minerals will be subordinated in accordance with the following guidelines:</P>
                  <P>(i) The estate providing for the subordination will not be utilized unless approved by HQDA (DAEN-REA).</P>
                  <P>(ii) Any subordination agreement, together with additional regulations incorporated by reference, must clearly define:</P>
                  <P>(A) The rights and obligations of the Government and the mineral owner, operator, and/or lessee.</P>
                  <P>(B) The control to be exercised over site development for mining purposes.</P>
                  <P>(C) Required land reclamation or restoration.</P>
                  <P>(D) Restrictions against pollution and degradation of project environment and aesthetics.</P>
                  <P>(E) Provisions for compliance inspection by the Government of all site development and mining activities over which the Government has control under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(2) After execution of a subordination agreement as provided above, the District Engineer will develop a program for the surveillance of mineral activities at each project.</P>

                  <P>(3) The representatives of the Division and District Engineers are to be fully informed concerning the rights and responsibilities of the Government and the mineral owner and/or operator <PRTPAGE P="97"/>under the terms of the estates acquired for the subordination of minerals, and will periodically inspect all mining activities to insure compliance with the terms of the subordination agreement and any plan incorporated by reference into such agreement.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Off-project mineral activity.</E> In connection with all drainage basins, where there is present or potential mineral activity upstream from a project or nearby lands outside the project limits, the District Engineer will:</P>
                  <P>(1) Establish and maintain liaison with Federal and State agencies having responsibility for the regulation of mineral activities and the control of environment in order to prevent adverse effects of mining on the project.</P>
                  <P>(2) Institute a system for monitoring adverse effects on the project such as sedimentation and acid drainage.</P>
                  <P>(3) Take steps to insure that Corps personnel in charge of the project are familiar with State and Federal laws governing the control of mineral recovery and the environment, as well as the Federal or State agencies responsible for the enforcement of such laws.</P>
                  <P>(4) Division and District Engineers are requested to use the Refuse Act of 1899 and any other legal remedies that may be appropriate in a particular situation in order to protect the interests of the United States and preserve the integrity of the project.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Feasibility Reports and Design Memoranda.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Feasibility investigations and reports.</E> Survey investigations and reports are the studies and reports, specifically authorized by Congress and made by Division and District Engineers as assigned by the Chief of Engineers, to determine the scope, justification, and degree of Federal interest in protection and development of harbors, waterways, shores and beaches, and river basins. For water resource projects the reports include determination of needs of alternative plans of protection and development to be considered for recommendation to Congress for authorization as Federal projects. Survey reports should clearly specify real estate requirements, both immediate and prospective, and the responsibilities of Federal and non-Federal agencies relative thereto. The real estate estimates in the reports should be recent enough to be meaningful for the purpose intended. Documentation regarding the estimates, such as when and by whom made, nature and extent of field investigation, search for comparable sales and similar factual material, shall be maintained.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Phase I and Phase II General Design Memoranda.</E> (1) The General Design Memorandum (GDM) is a report on an authorized project. Its form and content are set forth in ER 1110-2-1150. It includes a real estate section, which consists of a general discussion of real estate requirements for the project, recommendations as to estates to be acquired, a gross appraisal of the necessary land and interests therein, and other features considered desirable to present all major real estate problems and to recommend solutions. Subject to the availability of data, minerals in the project area should be covered in the manner set forth in § 644.5. Detailed sales data are not necessary, but may be included if it is anticipated that recommendations will be made for early acquisition of interior tracts.</P>
                  <P>(2) Real Estate personnel will prepare the real estate section of the GDM. The requirements for current real estate estimates and necessary documentation thereof contained in § 644.6(a) are also applicable to this paragraph.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Real Estate Design Memoranda.</E> (1) Following approval of the Phase I GDM, a Real Estate Design Memorandum (REDM) will be prepared by the Division or District Engineer. Approval of the REDM shall be in accordance with ER 1110-2-1150, para 21b(2)(j). No land shall be acquired for the project without approval of the initial REDM except (i) in the case of an advance land acquisition situation, (ii) acquisition for local cooperation project, or (iii) when a letter-type REDM has been submitted. The REDM will include the following in the order set forth below:</P>

                  <P>(A) A statement that this REDM is tentative in nature for planning purposes only and that both the final real property acquisition lines and the estimate of value are subject to change even after approval of this REDM.<PRTPAGE P="98"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(B) Project authorization, designation, location and date of approval of GDM Phase I, including the Recreation Resources Appendix (App A, ER 1110-2-1150).</P>
                  <P>(C) General description of the area and estimated total acreage. The total acreage will be broken down as to fee and easement areas. The fee will be further broken down to indicate, separately, the estimated acreage required for the various authorized project purposes.</P>
                  <P>(D) If any Government-owned land is within the area, indicate the Government's estate, degree of interest required for project purposes, and views of the local representative of the controlling agency as to use for project purposes (see Act of July 26, 1956 (70 Stat. 656) with respect to national forest land).</P>
                  <P>(E) Appraisal information containing a general statement as to character, present use and highest and best use of the land, local economic conditions which may affect the trend of real estate values in the community and the gross estimate of value for the area to be acquired under the REDM. The gross appraisal on which this estimate is based should be forwarded concurrently to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314.</P>
                  <P>(F) Information necessary to ascertain responsibility under Pub. L. 91-646 including but not limited to the following:</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The number of persons, farms and businesses to be displaced.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) An estimate of all costs, including contingencies to be incurred as a result of compliance with Pub. L. 91-646. Part 641 of this subchapter sets out the items to be considered in estimating these costs.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Information regarding the availability of replacement housing.</P>
                  <P>(G) Estimated cost to the United States of lands, easements, and rights-of-way necessary for acquisition by the United States for:</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Access roads to project area. A statement will be included as to whether existing public roads will be utilized within the purview of 33 U.S.C. 701r-1 or new rights-of-way for access roads will be acquired, with the estimated cost of such new rights-of-way. The proposed plan of access during construction will be fully described.</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Relocation of highways, roads, railroads, pipelines, and utilities (ER 1180-1-1, Section 73). Statement will be included as to whether the Government or the owner(s) will acquire new rights-of-way, if any, necessary for the various relocations.</P>
                  <P>(H) Number of structures and facilities which will come within the purview of section 111 of the Act of Congress approved July 3, 1958 (Pub. L. 85-500), and a preliminary estimate of Government costs (ER 1180-1-1, Section 73).</P>
                  <P>(I) A study, in accordance with § 644.5, of present or anticipated mineral activity in the vicinity of the project which may affect the operation thereof. A recommendation including cost estimate, if applicable, regarding the acquisition of the minerals should also be included in this section of the REDM.</P>
                  <P>(J) A discussion of standing timber and other vegetative cover in proposed recreation areas and other areas above the conservation pool which have recreation or scenic value. Recommendations should be made as to the significance of such timber and cover and as to whether reservation of standing timber should be permitted in the various parts of the fee area.</P>

                  <P>(K) A map(s) showing the area which is the subject of the REDM, indicating the acquisition guide line, contour line, the tentative blocked out fee line, multipurpose pool, and lands in which the acquisition of easements is recommended. The map(s) will show, where appropriate, the dam site, construction area, borrow areas, spoil areas, public access areas, fish and wildlife areas, and recreation areas. In addition, the appropriate map(s) will have outlined thereon the items of construction or major project features. Access roads and railroad rights-of-way required for these areas will also be shown. Chapter 3 of ER 405-1-12 relates to the preparation of maps. With respect to a project where it is planned to submit several REDMs covering portions of the project, the initial REDM will contain a map showing the entire project, with the information shown thereon as indicated above, insofar as this information covering the entire <PRTPAGE P="99"/>project is then available. All subsequent REDMs will contain the same type of map, on which will be shown the area(s) on which REDMs have been previously submitted with each such area keyed to the number of its REDM. Maps shall be of sufficient scale to be legible and to permit ready interpretation of pertinent features.</P>
                  <P>(L) An aerial mosaic, if available, to provide a pictorial support to the rest of the report concerning involved problems.</P>
                  <P>(M) Discussion relating to the acquisition or relocation of towns and cemeteries within the project area (ER 1180-1-1, Section 73).</P>
                  <P>(N) A realistic estimate of administrative costs, giving due recognition to existing and foreseeable conditions. To assure direct relationship between costs and estimates, the breakdown of these estimates will conform to the prescribed acquisition activity cost items as set forth under Real Estate Schedule/Cost and Performance, ENG Form 4564, or any further breakdown which the District Engineer may consider desirable. Included as a minimum requirement will be: Estimated administrative costs for mapping, surveying, and boundary monumentation, appraising, title evidence, negotiating and closing direct purchases, condemnation, and relocation assistance.</P>

                  <P>(O) Summary of project real estate costs, total all project real estate costs by category, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, land cost, improvements, severance, Pub. L. 91-646 costs, relocations, minerals, contingencies, administrative costs, etc.</P>
                  <P>(P) Schedule of acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(Q) Discussion and recommendations concerning the nonstandard estates proposed for acquisition and the real property boundary lines.</P>
                  <P>(R) The extent of the existing navigational servitude (ER 1165-2-302).</P>
                  <P>(S) The REDMs will be assigned a single basic number for each project; succeeding REDMs will be given alphabetical suffixes to the basic assigned number—for example, REDM Nos. 5, 5A, 5B, etc. Copies of the letter of transmittal and indorsements thereon will be inserted in the front of each copy of the REDM. A cover sheet will list chronologically all REDMs (including supplements thereto and brief letter-type memoranda) previously submitted, and will show dates submitted by the District Engineer and, if approved, dates of approval thereof.</P>
                  <P>(2) Upon approval of each REDM, the Division or District Engineer may, subject to the availability of funds, proceed with the acquisition of land and/or interests therein. The REDM, as approved, will constitute the overall real estate plan for acquisition of the area covered by the REDM. Whenever changes in the approved REDM are required, a supplementary REDM describing the proposed changes and setting forth the reasons therefor will be submitted. Approval of a supplemental REDM is required before acquisition can proceed in the area in which the changes are proposed.</P>
                  <P>(3) Prior to the approval of the REDM, Division and District Engineers should, subject to the availability of funds, proceed with preliminary real estate work, in the same manner as set out in § 644.30. No action will be taken to solicit an offer from a landowner for the purchase of his land until the acquisition has been approved and subject to availability of funds and compliance with the applicable provisions of Pub. L. 91-646.</P>
                  <P>(4) An REDM is not required for projects authorized by the Congress subject to the condition that local interests furnish without cost to the United States the necessary lands, easements, and rights-of-way. However, the GDM should include a statement enumerating the requirements of local cooperation, the name of the local interests proposing to fulfill said requirements, an estimate of land costs, and any other information pertinent thereto.</P>
                  <P>(5) Number and content of Real Estate Design Memorandum.</P>
                  <P>(i) With respect to reservoir projects involving an extensive real estate program, it is considered preferable that more than one REDM be prepared so that each will cover a segment or group of segments, making up the total project, consistent with the planned schedule of acquisition.</P>

                  <P>(ii) For those projects, requiring two or more REDMs to cover the project area, each REDM will include all contiguous lands for each public access <PRTPAGE P="100"/>point and recreational site proposed within the area covered by that REDM. Noncontiguous areas planned for these purposes that are located beyond the limits of the REDM involved will be omitted therefrom. This procedure does not apply to areas authorized for fish and wildlife purposes. Lands authorized specifically for fish and wildlife purposes may be included either in a conventional REDM, along with other project lands or be submitted as a separate REDM, depending on convenience in preparation and size of the area. However, in either event, whenever practicable, the entire area proposed for this purpose should be covered in one REDM, as a unit.</P>
                  <P>(iii) For smaller projects, not involving an extensive real estate program, all real estate requirements, including those for public access, fish and wildlife, and recreation, may be covered in a single REDM.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Blocking out.</E> The following are guidelines to be observed to the extent possible in preparing the REDM. These guidelines will be adhered to by the Division Engineer in his approval of the final real estate acquisition lines.</P>
                  <P>(1) Close blocking out will be accomplished in accordance with sound real estate practices.</P>
                  <P>(2) For land acquired in fee, the blocked out final real estate acquisition line will be established in such manner as to minimize costs and cause the least disruption in the use of the remainder of the ownership.</P>
                  <P>(3) Severance damages will be avoided to the extent possible consistent with real estate requirements for the project. In accordance with section 301 of Pub. L. 91-646, if the acquisition of part of a tract will render the remainder an uneconomic unit, an offer must be made to purchase the entire tract.</P>
                  <P>(4) It is conceivable that, in certain instances, acquisition of an easement will result in an uneconomic remainder and this requires application of section 301 of Pub. L. 91-646, as in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(5) A remnant without access need not be acquired if:</P>
                  <P>(i) The owner desires to retain the property and releases the Government from damages for lack of access, and</P>
                  <P>(ii) The obtaining of such release in lieu of acquisition is concurred in, in writing, by the local road authority, and the local road authority is released from damages due to loss of access.</P>
                  <P>(6) For lands to be acquired in fee or easements, close tangent will be used, generally following the acquisition line.</P>
                  <P>(7) When small portions of additional properties, not otherwise needed for the project, are within the acquisition line, they may be omitted if to do so will not materially affect the operation and maintenance of the project as determined by operational elements.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Acquisition lines.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Tentative acquisition lines.</E> As indicated in § 644.6(c)(1)(iii)(K), tentative acquisition lines are shown on maps which are part of the REDM. However, at that time, the lines will, to some extent, be irregular and located without full regard to their effect upon fringe tracts. It will, therefore, be necessary to establish final acquisition lines, in accordance with sound real estate practices. Accordingly, fringe tracts will not be acquired until the final acquisition lines are approved by the Division Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission.</E> As soon as possible after authority has been granted to acquire the land and/or interest therein, the District Engineer will complete appraisals covering the fringe tracts. Thereupon, a map showing proposed final acquistion lines will be submitted to the Division Engineer, accompanied by justification and reasons therefor. This submission may be for an entire project or by segments or units. However, if the final map is submitted on a segment or unit basis, each segment or unit must be complete in itself and not be dependent on another segment or unit not submitted for approval.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval.</E> The Division Engineer is authorized to approve final acquisition lines, but shall not delegate this responsibility to District Engineers. This authority is subject to the following:</P>

                  <P>(1) Except for the addition or deletion of individial ownerships, or portions thereof, on the basis of the criteria contained in § 644.6(d), approval of any changes in the overall plan will be in compliance with ER 1110-2-1150.<PRTPAGE P="101"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(2) Estates in individual tracts may be changed if consistent with the overall plan. Approval, however, will be required from HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) if the estates are non-standard.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Planning and scheduling real estate activities.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Normal scheduling.</E> (1) The objective of a planned program is to provide for the early acquistion of land to avoid enhancement in land prices and a minimum of inconvenience to the property owners. Also, it is essential that there be adequate planning of the land acquisition program to insure that there is no interference with unacquired properties as a result of construction activities.</P>
                  <P>(2) It is essential that adequate funds be programmed on ENG Form 2213, Advance Engineering and Design Planning Schedule (PB-2B), to proceed with real estate planning; preparation of Real Estate Design Memoranda; determination of final project boundaries; and preliminary real estate work to the point where land acquisition can be started as soon as construction funds become available.</P>
                  <P>(3) Surveys and boundary monumentation and/or marking shall be completed prior to acquistion.</P>
                  <P>(4) Funds will be programmed for acquisition of lands for the construction area and/or other areas initially required within the first year, and for acquisition of lands for the other features of the project as rapidly as necessary real estate data can be assembled. For projects with major impoundment features and with scheduled construction periods of more than two years, funds will be programmed at a uniform level so that total real estate requirements will be covered by accepted offers to sell or declarations of taking filed in court by the end of two-thirds of the overall construction period.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Public information.</E> (1) The real estate activities of the Corps are extremely sensitive, since they disrupt the lives of individuals and take their homes, farms and businesses. Therefore, the importance of keeping landowners and others having an interest in the land informed of the land acquisition program is emphasized. In order to avoid false rumors and to permit the affected owners to formulate plans for the future, information concerning the land acquisition program, procedures with respect thereto, and the specific effect on the individual properties, will be furnished to the affected owners at the outset of the project.</P>

                  <P>(2) Section 302 of Pub. L. 86-645 (33 U.S.C. 597) is quoted, in part, for guidance:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>Within six months after the date that Congress authorizes construction of a water resource development project under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army, the Corps of Engineers shall make reasonable effort to advise owners and occupants in and adjacent to the project area as to the probable timing for the acquisition of lands for the project and for incidental rights-of-way, relocations, and any other requirements affecting owners and occupants. Within a reasonable time after initial appropriations are made for land acquisition or construction, including relocations, the Corps of Engineers shall conduct public meetings at locations convenient to owners and tenants to be displaced by the project in order to advise them of the proposed plans for acquisition and to afford them an opportunity to comment. To carry out the provisions of this section, the Chief of Engineers shall issue regulations to provide, among other things, dissemination of the following information to those affected: (1) Factors considered in making the appraisals; (2) desire to purchase property without going to court; (3) legal right to submit to condemnation proceedings; (4) Payments for moving expenses or other losses not covered by appraised market value; (5) occupancy during construction; (6) removal of improvements; (7) payments required from occupants of Government-acquired land; (8) withdrawals by owners of deposits made in court by Government; and (9) use of land by owner when easement is acquired.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  

                  <P>(3) Within a reasonable time after initial appropriations are made for land acquisition or construction, including relocations, Division and District Engineers will conduct meetings with landowners. The United States Senators of the state or states and Members of the House of Representatives of the district or districts in which the project is located should be invited to attend. Normally, the public meetings should be scheduled prior to the commencement of the land acquisition program. The agenda for the meetings will include not only the nine specific items listed in section 302, Pub. L. 86-645, but all other items of a nature <PRTPAGE P="102"/>that will assist landowners and tenants in understanding all of the Corps' real estate procedures such as, but not limited to: Acquisition schedules, the type of land interests to be acquired under the Joint Policy, approximate acquisition lines, management of the project, etc. In addition to the foregoing, pamphlets containing this information and the information brochure explaining the benefits to landowners under Pub. L. 91-646 will be given wide distribution at approximately the same time the landowners meeting program is initiated, and copies will be furnished to the appropriate United States Senators and Members of the House of Representatives.</P>
                  <P>(4) Inquiries, comments of landowners and tenants, and problems developed at the landowners meetings should be recorded or, at least, a detailed written resume made. HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) should be informed as to the outcome of these meetings. Effective follow-up to supply any information not available at the meeting, or to consider any particular problems presented, is essential to realize the full advantage of the public relations program.</P>
                  <P>(5) The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to all water resource development projects, including all local cooperation projects for which real estate is to be acquired in whole or in part by local interests. Initial information as to such projects for which real estate acquisition is exclusively a local interest responsibility may be given, within six months after project authorization, by either the local interest or Federal Government, through the media best adaptable under the circumstances. Advice should be given as to the timing of acquisition of the lands and lesser interests, and also as to the extent to which acquisition will be accomplished by the local interests. After appropriations, the local interests should be encouraged to sponsor and conduct a landowners meeting with attendance by Corps of Engineers representatives. If there is a joint responsibility for real estate acquisition, the local interests should explain the scheduled requirement for possession of the lands involved and their acquisition procedures, and the Corps of Engineers representatives should explain the procedures followed when lands are condemned by the Federal Government on behalf of local interests, and the authority for each action.</P>
                  <P>(6) If local interests refuse to call a landowners meeting, the District Engineer should call such a meeting, to explain the general construction features of the project, to inform the landowners and tenants that local interests are obligated to acquire the necessary lands, to state that we cannot explain the exact procedures which will be followed by local interests, but to explain the procedures followed when lands are condemned by the Federal Government on behalf of local interests. If only a very few landowners and tenants are involved, local interests may hold their meeting in the District Engineer's office or at a location more convenient to the landowners and tenants. While this would not be a formal meeting, the same type of information would be furnished. Here, also the District Engineer should call such a meeting if local interests refuse to do so.</P>
                  <P>(7) To summarize, public (landowners) meetings are required by section 302 of Pub. L. 86-645. This requirement applies to local cooperation projects as well as to the large Federal water resources development projects. The meetings will be held by Division/District Engineers, to comply with the law, if local interests refuse to call meetings at which information would normally be furnished jointly by the local interests and by the Corps of Engineers representatives.</P>
                  <P>(8) Real Estate personnel and the Public Affairs Officers of the Division and District Engineers should cooperate closely in planning vigorous public relations programs as contemplated in this paragraph and through the press, radio, and television.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Land acquisition funds for land acquisition in advance of project construction.</E> (1) A Land Acquisition Fund in the amount of $2 million was established as a part of the appropriations contained in the Public Works for Water, Pollution Control, and Power Development and Atomic Energy Commission Appropriation Act, 1971 (Pub. L. 91-439). Comments of the House Appropriations Committee in establishing <PRTPAGE P="103"/>the Fund are contained in House Committee Report No. 91-1219, 91st Congress, 1st Session, as follows:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>New land acquisition fund. The committee has approved the budget proposal to allocate $2 million to establish a fund for land acquisition, in advance of project construction, to alleviate severe hardship cases and to avoid price escalation. The proposal has been approved with the understanding that prior committee approval will be obtained for initial purchases in each project area and that use of the fund shall be confined to those projects on which planning has progressed to the point that the damsite has been finalized, and it is known with certainty the lands to be acquired for the project.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <FP>This fund was increased to $3 million by the Public Works for Water and Power Development and Atomic Energy Commission Appropriation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 92-405).</FP>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Expenditures from the Fund are applicable to <E T="03">authorized</E> water resource development projects for which land acquisition is a Federal responsibility.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Guidelines for utilization of the Fund for Advance Land Acquisitions.</E> (i) The Fund will be used to acquire private and non-Federal publicly-owned properties at authorized water resource development projects on which planning has progressed to the point that the damsite has been finalized and it is established with certainty that the individual properties will be required for the project.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Only those individual properties will be considered for acquisition where it can be shown that advance acquisition of the properties will alleviate severe hardship to the landowner and/or will avoid unusual land price escalation. Unusual price escalation cases involve those individually owned properties where it can be demonstrated that the land value will materially escalate, prior to commencement of the land acquisition program for the project from future appropriations for land acquisition or construction, because of imminent actions which will change the highest and best use of land, such as zoning actions, planned construction on the land and other changes in real estate market factors which will materially escalate land values. Normal land escalation occurring to all properties in general within a project will not be considered as a basis for acquisition. Hardship cases include, but are not necessarily limited to, cases involving the following:</P>
                  <P>(A) The landowner has a valid contract to purchase a replacement property and failure to dispose of his property inside the project will force him to default the contract, forfeit his deposit, or otherwise lose the benefits of the contract, and other replacement property is not available within the same area under similar terms;</P>
                  <P>(B) The property owner is forced to relocate from the area due to his employment or other circumstances beyond his control, and the Government's project has so affected the sale of properties within the project area as to make a sale to another private party at a fair and reasonable price extremely difficult; and</P>
                  <P>(C) Illness of the owner or other members of his family, or other personal hardship makes his relocation from the area necessary and the Government's project has so affected the sale of properties within the project area as to make a sale to another private party at a fair and reasonable price extremely difficult.</P>
                  <P>(D) As indicated above, these examples are not intended to exclude other cases where, in the exercise of sound judgment, actual hardship is found to exist.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Individual tract ownerships recommended for advance acquisition by Division and District Engineers and approved by OCE will be acquired by direct purchase or through the filing of condemnation proceedings, in accordance with normal procedures.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> Individual tract ownerships which Division and District Engineers consider are hardship cases or involve unusual price escalation, within the guidelines set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section should be recommended to OCE for acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(i) Full justification must be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-CWB) WASH DC 20314 in support of the recommendation to acquire the individual ownerships.</P>

                  <P>(ii) If the recommendation is approved, action will be taken by OCE to <PRTPAGE P="104"/>obtain approval of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Upon receipt of Committee approvals, the Division Engineer will be authorized to proceed with the acquisition action if sufficient funds are available from the Land Acquisition Fund.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Appropriate records will be maintained by District or Division Engineers of allocations made from the Fund which are used for approved acquisition cases. These funds will be accounted for under a designated account number.</P>
                  <P>(iv) When appropriations for land acquisition or construction of the Federal project are specifically made by the Congress, the initial allowance of funds to the project will be reduced by the amount previously allotted from the Land Acquisition Fund in order to replenish the Fund for use at other projects.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Acquisition for State or local interests—Resettlement sites.</E> (1) Section 209 of Pub. L. 90-483 (82 Stat. 745) enacted August 13, 1968, provides that the Secretary of the Army may, prior to the approval of title by the Attorney General, acquire, enter upon, and take possession of lands or interests in lands by purchase, donation, condemnation or otherwise, whenever any State, or any agency or instrumentality of a State or local Government, or any nonprofit incorporated body organized or chartered under the law of the State, or any nonprofit association, shall undertake to secure any lands or interests therein as a site for the resettlement of families, individuals, and business concerns displaced by a river and harbor improvement, flood control or other duly authorized water resource project, and</P>
                  <P>(i) It is determined by the Secretary of the Army that the State or local interest is unable to acquire the necessary land, or unable to acquire it with sufficient promptness, and</P>
                  <P>(ii) The Governor of the State in which the site is located has requested such acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Cost of acquisition.</E> The Act also provides that:</P>
                  <P>(i) All expenses of acquisition accomplished under the authority of the Act, including any award that may be made in a condemnation proceeding, the cost of title evidence, appraisals and any other costs incident to such acquisition, shall be paid by the State, agency, instrumentality or nonprofit body.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The State, agency, instrumentality or nonprofit body may repay such amount from any funds made available to it by any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality, other than the Department of the Army.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Pending such payment, the Secretary of the Army may expend from any funds appropriated for the project such sums as may be necessary to carry out section 209, Pub. L. 90-483.</P>
                  <P>(iv) To secure such payment, the State, agency, instrumentality or nonprofit body may be required to execute a proper bond before acquisition is commenced.</P>
                  <P>(v) Any sums paid by a State, agency, instrumentality or nonprofit body under section 209 shall be credited to the appropriation for the project.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Determinations required before application of section 209.</E> No acquisition by the Department of the Army may be undertaken under this section until the Secretary of the Army has determined, after consultation with appropriate Federal, State and local government agencies, that:</P>
                  <P>(i) The development of a site is necessary in order to alleviate hardships to displaced persons;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The location of the site is suitable for development in relation to present or potential sources of employment; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) A plan for development of the site has been approved by appropriate local government authorities in the area or community in which the site is located.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Action by District or Division Engineer.</E> When the District Engineer is of the opinion that section 209 may be applicable to a given situation, after consultation with State and State agency officials, the Governor of the State should be advised of the pertinent provisions of the law and the assistance that can be rendered by the Secretary of the Army under the terms and conditions of the law at the request of the Governor. If planning towards resettlement is undertaken by a State, agency, instrumentality or nonprofit body, the District Engineer will keep advised of <PRTPAGE P="105"/>the progress of such local planning and will furnish guidelines and consultation to the local interests during development of the plan.</P>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Implementation of the Plan of Resettlement.</E> When the final plan has been developed and approved by the appropriate Federal, State and local governmental agencies (which will include information showing that the site is necessary to alleviate hardships to displaced persons and suitable for development in relation to present or potential sources of employment), a showing has been made that the State is unable to acquire the necessary lands or interests therein or is unable to acquire the lands with sufficient promptness, the Governor has executed a request that the Secretary of the Army acquire the lands under the terms and conditions of the Act, and the State or agency of the State has executed a proper bond in an amount deemed necessary to cover total expenditures to be made by the Army for the land acquisition, the District Engineer should submit to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 a brief Real Estate Design Memorandum covering the land to be acquired under the plan. The REDM should be accompanied by the final approved plan and the information listed above in order that the Secretary may make the determinations as required by section 209(b) of Pub. L. 90-483. No action will be taken by the District Engineer to acquire the land, proposed for acquisition in the plan and the REDM, until receipt of authority from DAEN-REA-P to proceed with the acquisition. A complete record will be maintained of all land and administrative costs incident to the acquisition as a basis for a request for reimbursement to the State and/or the State agency or agencies. Upon authorization to the District Engineer to proceed with land acquisitions of the site, normal Corps land acquisitions procedures will be followed.</P>
                  <P>(6) <E T="03">Conveyance of the site to the State or State agency or agencies.</E> In accordance with section 209(c) of Pub. L. 90-483, upon completion of the acquisition of the site, a proper deed will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 for execution by the Secretary of the Army, for conveyance of the land to the State or State agency, as appropriate. Evidence must be submitted that the terms and conditions of the deed have the approval of the Governor and the agency to which conveyance is to be made. The deed will not be delivered until reimbursement has been made to the United States for the land and administrative costs expended by the District Engineer incident to the acquisition of the site.</P>

Commanders and site boards should be informed of any available lands, including marginal lands in civil works projects and available lands under the control of other departments and agencies, suitable for the desired purpose. The using service will request the Chief of Engineers or the appropriate Division or District Engineer to prepare a Real Estate Planning Report or Real Estate Summary, making reference to the prior Site Selection Report if one was prepared.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Real Estate Planning Reports.</E> (1) A Real Estate Planning Report (REPR), as shown in Figure 2-1 in ER 405-1-12, will be prepared by the Division or District Engineer for all major fee and easement projects other than Reserve Component projects and extinguishment of grazing privileges on Federal lands. The request for such REPR may be initiated by any command or echelon of the Army or Air Force (or by the Washington Headquarters or field operations offices of DOE for a Real Estate Design Memorandum). Certain items contained in Figure 2-1 (ER 405-1-12) relate only to Department of the Air Force land acquisition programs for runways and approach zones and are not applicable to other projects. Such items will be omitted from REPRs where not applicable. When forwarding the REPR, a copy of the Reviewing Appraiser Comment, concerning the estimated land values assigned therein, should be included as an inclosure to the transmittal letter.</P>
                  <P>(2) On Department of the Air Force projects where estimated cost is not in excess of $25,000, brief REPRs are to be prepared for issuance of directives by the approprate Air Force Regional Civil Engineer (AFRCE). Such reports need not be submitted to the Chief of Engineers except in those cases in which the major command submits a copy to Headquarters, USAF. This report should contain adequate information on the items listed in the following outline but need not be limited thereto:</P>
                  <P>(i) Requirement for the property.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Cost estimate of the property with indication of the method used in arriving at the estimate.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Summary sheet showing the acreages, interests to be acquired, improvements and estimated costs, including the administrative costs of acquiring the real property and all costs in connection with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-646).</P>
                  <P>(iv) Map showing property to be acquired, ownerships, and relation to existing installation, where appropriate.</P>
                  <P>(v) In reports covering the acquisition of runway clearance easements, a profile, topographic, and obstruction drawing should be furnished.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Discussions of any peculiar or unusual problems anticipated in connection with the proposed acquisition including relocation assistance required by Pub. L. 91-646.</P>
                  <P>(vii) Recommendations of the office preparing the report.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Planning Documents for Reserve Component Acquisitions.</E> Figure 2-2 in ER 405-1-12 is a sample of an REPR for use in acquisition of land for the U.S. Army Reserve Program. This report omits some items which appear in the usual planning report but includes other items particularly applicable to U.S. Army Reserve sites.<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Real Estate Planning Report.</E> The REPR for Reserve Component acquisitions should contain the following:</P>
                  <P>(i) A list of all sites inspected with reasons for rejection of the other sites.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Description of physical characteristics of the site.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Type and extent of grading and drainage required.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Soil and foundation conditions with classification of overburden materials (to be determined by test borings only if conditions indicate this necessity).</P>
                  <P>(v) Availability of adequate access, water supply, electricity, gas for space heating, sewage disposal, drainage conditions, and telephone services. Where it is necessary to construct or extend streets, water, sewer, or other utility facilities to serve the selected site, a written commitment will be obtained from the municipal authorities assuring the United States that the municipality will perform such work without cost to the United States, or indicating the proportionate share of the costs the municipality will bear. This commitment will be made a part of the REPR.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Cost estimates of supporting facilities and any unusual building foundations, itemized to the degree practicable to indicate items, quantities, sizes, unit prices and totals.</P>
                  <P>(vii) A preliminary site plan, showing existing conditions and proposed layout, to insure adequacy of the site for its intended ultimate use.</P>
                  <P>(viii) A formal legal commitment in the form of a resolution or other instrument authorizing a long-term, nominal-rental lease or a donation, together with a reference to the authority to grant the lease or make the donation, in instances where land is owned by a State, county, city or other political subdivision.</P>
                  <P>(ix) A draft of the proposed lease in terms acceptable to the lessor, taking into consideration the requirements in DOD Directive 4165.16.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Agreements for Joint National Guard-Army Reserve Center.</E> Title 10, U.S.C., 2231 through 2238, DOD Directives 1225.2 and 1225.5, and AR 140-478 contain policy and directions for the establishment of this type of training facility. The Division or District Engineer will participate in negotiation of the joint-use agreement and preparation of the necessary instruments, in coordination with local Army Reserve and National Guard representatives. A copy of the agreement so negotiated will be attached to each copy of the REPR prior to its distribution for review. DOD Directive 1225.2 provides in part: “The agreement shall remain in full force and effect for the fixed term of years which represents the estimated useful life of the facility.” This provision has generally been interpreted as fixing the use term at 25 years, although the probably useful life of a well-maintained armory type structure is much longer. The DOD provision states a minimum requirement; however, it does not preclude the Army from securing a longer period of use. In order to secure a use term more commensurate with the Government investment, joint-use agreements, at a minimum, will be set up on a 25-year basis, with the option on the part of the Government to renew for an additional 25-year period under the same terms and conditions.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Real Estate Summary.</E> Considerable time, effort and funds can be saved if REPRs are foregone in those cases involving acquisition of property for U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard use by transfer from another military department or the General Services Administration. The Real Estate document in support of such proposed acquisitions will be a Real Estate Summary which will contain the following elements only:</P>
                  <P>(i) Authority for request.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Acreage and estate.</P>

                  <P>(vii) Justification for use of the property as provided by the Command. Proposed construction (if any) should be included.</P>
                  <P>(viii) Engineering Feasibility Study (if construction is planned).</P>

                  <P>(ix) Draft Acquisition Report is required for clearance under title 10 <PRTPAGE P="108"/>U.S.C. 2662 if <E T="03">estimated</E> gross fair market value is over $50,000 for acquisition by transfer from another military department.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Lease Planning Reports.</E> Reference is made to AR 405-10 and AFR 87-1, concerning requests for leasehold acquisitions. A Lease Planning Report will be submitted upon request of the Chief of Engineers or the using service. Figure 2-3 in ER 405-1-12 is a sample of a Lease Planning Report.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Grazing Land Reports.</E> (1) When Federal grazing lands are a part of a project and it is proposed to cancel, or to prevent the use of, grazing privileges thereon, under authority contained in the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1942, as amended (43 U.S.C. 315q), the REPR will be utilized with appropriate changes. The report will disclose each of the ranch units comprising grazing privileges, indicating, in tabulated form, the name of each operator, acreage owned in fee, acreage of State-owned land held under lease, acreage of railroad land held under lease, acreage of other privately owned land held under lease, acreage under Federal grazing permits or licenses, total acreage in ranch unit, total carrying capacity of ranch unit, and actual number of stock being carried on each ranch unit; whether project will be classified as a permanent or temporary installation; other acquisition problems, such as mining and water rights or claims, which may be encountered; and a project map indicating project boundaries, Federal and State-owned lands, and location of mining and water rights or claims.</P>
                  <P>(2) The cost estimate will be prepared in accordance with subpart B.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Distribution and approval of planning reports</E>—(1) <E T="03">Army projects.</E> Upon completion of a fee and/or easement planning report or a Lease Planning Report, the report will be processed as outlined in AR 405-10. Information will be included in the transmittal letter concerning status of environmental assessment or impact statement.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Air Force projects.</E> (i) Upon the completion, review and approval of a fee and/or easement planning report, the District Engineer will forward copies of the planning report to the Division Engineer who will forward the original and one copy with appropriate recommendations to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314. Simultaneously with this action, the Division Engineer will furnish the Major Air Command with six copies of the planning report for review, approval, and subsequent transmittal to Headquarters, USAF.</P>
                  <P>(ii) After preparation, review and approval, the District Engineer will submit the Lease Planning Report, wherein the estimated annual rental is in excess of $25,000, to the Division Engineer. Upon review and approval, the Division Engineer will forward the original and a copy, with appropriate recommendations, to DAEN-REA-L. Simultaneously with this action, the Division Engineer will furnish the Major Air Command with two copies of the report. The Chief of Engineers will review the report and forward the original to Headquarters, USAF, with appropriate recommendations.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">DOE projects.</E> Upon completion of a fee and/or easement real estate design memorandum and review and approval by the District Engineer and, in turn, the Division Engineer, a copy of the report will be submitted to the appropriate DOE office for review and approval. When notice of approval is received, the District Engineer will transmit, through the Division Engineer, the original and two copies of the REDM, with recommendations, and evidence of approval by the DOE field office, to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314. Upon review and approval, the Chief of Engineers will transmit the original and one copy of the REDM to Headquarters, DOE, for approval and further action.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Withdrawal of Public Domain for Defense Purposes.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) The Act of Congress approved February 28, 1958 (Pub. L. 85-337, 72 Stat. 27) provides that all withdrawals and reservations of public domain land, water, or land and water, or restrictions on use of areas in the Continental Shelf, aggregating an area of more than 5,000 acres for any one defense project, shall be by Act of Congress. Upon receipt of a request for withdrawal or reservation of lands of the public domain or for restrictions on exploration and exploitation in the Continental Shelf, and in order that the Chief of Engineers may present the project to higher authority for approval and submission to the Congress, if approved, the District Engineer will prepare and submit, through the Division Engineer, to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314 a Real Estate Planning Report, including the following items.</P>
                  <P>(1) A copy of the request from the Army or the using service.</P>
                  <P>(2) Complete information relative to the eight items specified in section 3 of Pub. L. 85-337 (43 U.S.C. 156).</P>
                  <P>(3) If the proposed withdrawal constitutes an expansion of an existing installation, pertinent data relative to the lands constituting the existing installation.</P>
                  <P>(4) Information relative to outstanding mineral, grazing, water and other rights.</P>
                  <P>(5) A statement as to the estimated cost:</P>
                  <P>(i) Of extinguishing such rights; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Of suspending the exercise of such rights on a leasehold (annual rental) basis.</P>
                  <P>(6) Map(s) indicating the exterior boundaries of the project; excepted areas, if any; location of mineral rights, water rights, and other resources discussed in the report.</P>
                  <P>(b) The District Engineer will also prepare and include a draft of application for withdrawal covering the eight items specified in section 3 of Pub. L. 85-337.</P>
                  <P>(c) Upon receipt of the REPR and draft of application for withdrawal, the Chief of Engineers will prepare a Real Estate Directive.</P>
                  <P>(d) The REPR, draft of application for withdrawal, and Real Estate Directive will be transmitted through the Chief of Staff and the appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Army to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs and Logistics) for approval of the acquisition and for coordination with the Department of the Interior (Bureau of Land Management). Upon receipt of approval from the ASD (MRA&amp;L), the Chief of Engineers will dispatch the application to the Department of the Interior and will draft the necessary legislation for processing through normal legislative channels.</P>
                  <P>(e) It has been determined that the words “in the aggregate” in section 2 of Pub. L. 85-337 shall be interpreted as applying only to withdrawals of land since enactment of Pub. L. 85-337. For example, if 4,500 acres of public land had been withdrawn prior to enactment of Pub. L. 85-337 and the new application for withdrawal covers 1,000 acres, the requirements of Pub. L. 85-337 do not have to be satisfied. If the new application covering 1,000 acres is honored and the withdrawal completed and a later requirement for 4,500 acres of public lands developed, the requirements of Pub. L. 85-337 would have to be satisfied.</P>
                  <P>(f) Pub. L. 85-337 and the above instructions do not relate to the use of public lands under permit.</P>
                  <P>(g) In Department of Air Force cases, the District Engineer will continue to prepare such REPR's and to furnish such other services as are requested by the Major Air Commands.</P>

                  <P>(h) When the REPR contains a proposal for the acquisition of minerals, the local office of the Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior, will be furnished with a copy of <PRTPAGE P="110"/>the Mineral Section of the planning report, which will indicate the number and types of claims, areas involved, and the gross appraisal. Accompanying this Mineral Section will be a request that the Bureau of Land Management place an item in the next available budget for the funds required for the validation of the mineral claims involved. A copy of the Mineral Section, together with a copy of the request to the local office of the Bureau of Land Management, will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314 for coordination with the Director, Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.</P>

                  <P>(a) As stated in AR 405-10 and AFR 87-1, no real estate or interests therein will be acquired until there is legislative authorization for the acquisition (41 U.S.C. 14) and an appropriation available for the purpose.</P>
                  <P>(b) AR 405-10 and AFR 87-1 also outline the clearances which must be made within the Departments of the Army and the Air Force, with the Department of Defense, and with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives before acquisition may proceed. The Chief of Engineers is responsible for initiating all clearance actions as to Army acquisitions. The Director of Engineering and Services (AF/PRE) and the Director of Planning, Programming and Analysis (AF/RDXI), as to industrial installations, of Headquarters, USAF, are responsible for initiating all clearance actions as to Air Force acquisitions.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Authority to issue Real Estate Directives.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Where there is legislative authorization, an appropriation is available, and necessary clearances have been obtained, the formal Real Estate Directive (designating the land to be acquired, the estate to be acquired, and the amount of funds available for the acquisition) will be issued by the head of the interested department or agency, or his designee.</P>
                  <P>(a) Authority to issue all Department of the Army Real Estate Directives is vested in the Chief of Engineers. The Chief of Engineers has been delegated authority from the Secretary of the Army, and has redelegated to Division and District Engineers authority, to approve:</P>
                  <P>(1) Acquisition of permits from other Government departments and agencies, excepting the use of space in the National Capital Region.</P>
                  <P>(2) The making of minor boundary changes in approved projects to avoid severance damages, by including or excluding small tracts of land which will not decrease the usefulness of the project for the purpose for which being acquired.</P>

                  <P>(b) The delegated authority referred to in paragraph (a) of this section was redelegated to Division and District Engineers, provided it can be accomplished without the allotment of additional funds: <E T="03">And provided,</E> That there is an existing Real Estate Directive. When there is a change in scope (area and/or funds), recommendation will be made to the Chief of Engineers for amendment of the directive.</P>
                  <P>(c) The Chief of Engineers has been delegated authority to approve for the Secretary of the Army leasehold acquisitions, including renewals and extensions, and space assignments from the General Services Administration, where the estimated annual rental for any single project is not in excess of $50,000 and the acquisition is not controversial, unusual, or inconsistent with Department of the Army policies, excepting the acquisition by lease of industrial and commercial facilities; projects requiring a certificate of necessity in accordance with the Act of Congress approved June 30, 1932, as amended (40 U.S.C. 278a); and space in the National Capital Region. This authority has been redelegated to the Division Engineer where the annual rental does not exceed $25,000.</P>
                  <P>(d) Authority to issue all Department of the Air Force Real Estate Directives is vested in the Real Property Division, Directorate of Engineering and Services, HQ, USAF. Major Air Commands and Air Force Regional Civil Engineers may issue Real Estate Directives for acquisitions not exceeding $50,000 in cost.</P>

                  <P>(1) Division Engineers will assign numbers to Real Estate Directives <PRTPAGE P="111"/>issued by Air Force Regional Civil Engineers. The numbers will be in a consecutive series for each Division and will be preceded by a symbol identifying the Division to which the directive is issued.</P>
                  <P>(2) All revisions to Real Estate Directives will be designated as amendments to the basic Real Estate Directive and will be appropriately numbered.</P>
                  <P>(3) Division Engineers will forward the original and one copy of each Directive, and each amendment thereto to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314.</P>
                  <P>(4) Commanders of Major Air Commands will approve requests for leases, lease renewals, and space assignments from the General Services Administration, where the estimated cost of the project does not exceed $50,000 per annum, and subject to any necessary clearances, excepting, however, the leasehold acquisitions listed in AFR 87-1.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Preliminary real estate work.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Preliminary real estate work is defined as that action taken with regard to the individual ownerships leading up to, but not including, solicitation of offers from landowners. It includes preparation or procurement of tract ownership data (ENG Form 900—Tract Ownership Data, where its use is considered desirable), legal descriptions and mapping, title evidence, and individual tract appraisals. At this stage of the acquisition program, it will be necessary to make some contact with landowners, tenants, or other interested persons; for example, the appraiser's discussion of the property with the owner, his agent, or other representative (Pub. L. 91-646, sec. 301(2)). In any such contacts, information should be confined to the fact that acquisition of the real property is being considered; no acquisition action can be taken until funds are made available; and, after acquisition is approved, as much advance notice as possible will be given to all interested parties. Supply of ENG Form 900 may be requisitioned from the OCE Publications Depot in the prescribed manner.</P>
                  <P>(b) Preliminary real estate work on Army projects will be conducted as soon as design has progressed to the point at which the exact land needed has been firmly determined, or as soon as the District Engineer has determined that it is practicable to proceed.</P>
                  <P>(c) Preliminary real estate work on Air Force projects will be conducted upon request of Headquarters, USAF, or Major Air Command installations, and at the request of any of those persons designated for industrial acquisitions.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) Subpart B describes the general procedures and standards <PRTPAGE P="112"/>governing all appraisal work undertaken in connection with the real estate responsibilities of the Corps of Engineers.</P>
                <P>(2) These guidelines are to promote and encourage the utilization of uniform appraisal methods, standards, and techniques. Their use should result in the most effective solutions to the many appraisal problems with which the Corps of Engineers is confronted in the implementation of its real estate programs involving acquisition, disposal, and management of all kinds of real property. They are to encourage the appraiser to include in his appraisal process sufficient factual data and other supporting information to develop sound, unbiased, and independent market value estimates; promote appraisal reporting techniques that reflect acceptable judicial concepts, intelligent and convincing reasoning; and provide a sound basis for negotiations and valid testimony in court.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Provisions of this subpart are applicable to the Office of the Chief of Engineers and all field operating agencies having real estate responsibilities.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures and standards.</E> (1) In acquiring, disposing, and managing real estate, or any interest therein, it is the practice of the Department of the Army to impartially protect the interests of all concerned.</P>
                <P>(2) The fair market value of the pertinent real estate interest in each parcel or tract of real property being acquired, disposed of or managed will be developed by a competent appraiser preparing an adequate appraisal report indicating sound estimates of values of each estate required. The appraisal may be prepared by either a staff employee or by a self-employed contract appraiser; however, each must have demonstrated the ability to exercise good judgment and must have had adequate experience in estimating the market value of the particular type of property involved. The qualifications and selection of staff appraisers will be based on the Civil Service Standards for the GS-1171 Series. A contract appraiser must also meet the experience requirements set forth in the Civil Service Standards.</P>
                <P>(3) It is the practice of the Chief of Engineers to engage the services of competent appraisers and consultants to augment staff capabilities in the appraisal of various real estate interests to be acquired, disposed of or managed by the Corps. Preference will be given to local appraisers and consultants, if qualified, and the costs of their services will be paid by the Government. Any appraiser having an interest in the property being appraised or any relationship, family or business, to the owner thereof, will be disqualified from appraising that particular tract.</P>
                <P>(4) Normally, only one appraisal per ownership or tract will be obtained. However, in cases involving controversial appraisal problems or precedent setting patterns of value in first priority areas of large projects, more than one appraisal of the same property may be obtained if considered necessary by the Division or District Engineer. If negotiations with the owners have reached an impasse and it appears that the filing of condemnation proceedings will be necessary to acquire the land or interest therein, the joint Corps of Engineers-Department of Justice policy provides that in fee takings, where the value of the property is between $50,000 and $100,000 only one appraisal need be provided to the Department of Justice so long as it is a contract appraisal; two appraisals will be provided for values exceeding $100,000. In the filing of condemnation proceedings for easement takings in excess of $50,000 two appraisals will be required. At least one of the two appraisals must be made by a contract appraiser. More often than not, both will be by contract appraisers.</P>
                <P>(5) Each appraisal report will be carefully reviewed and acted upon by a qualified reviewing appraiser.</P>

                <P>(6) It is essential that negotiations for any required real estate interests be conducted on the basis of an approved appraisal that reflects current fair market value. Any appraisal report with an effective date of six months or more prior to initiation of negotiations with the landowner or the date of filing of a condemnation action is considered outdated and should be reviewed and brought up to date to reflect current market conditions.<PRTPAGE P="113"/>
                </P>
                <P>(7) The appraiser may be called upon, in condemnation proceedings or otherwise, to establish the validity and competence of his estimates. He must familiarize himself with basic rules of trial evidence so that his testimony will be admissible and of probative value. Since, as a witness, he must be prepared to offer convincing testimony, his report should contain an analysis of all factual data upon which his estimates are based.</P>
                <P>(8) Local representatives of the Department of Justice are available for consultation in matters pertaining to acquisitions and legal principles involved in valuation problems.</P>
                <P>(9) Appraised valuations and the supporting appraisal reports, for acquisition or disposal purposes, are privileged information and the appraiser should not divulge his findings and opinions to anyone except authorized officials of the Government. Section 301(3), Pub. L. 91-646, January 2, 1971, dictates that written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount of the estimate of just compensation, shall be furnished the property owner. This does not mean that the appraisal report or any part of it should be given to the landowner, but only a summary of the amount and methods of appraisal.</P>
                <P>(10) The appraiser is usually the first personal contact the owner has with a representative of the Government. The owner is generally the prime source of information pertaining to the history, condition, management, and operation of the property. It has always been the Corps' practice for the appraiser to contact and consult with the owner of a property prior to and during the inspection of the tract. Section 301(2), Pub. L. 91-646, January 2, 1971, dictates that “* * * the owner shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his inspection of the property.” Before the appraiser makes his first visit to the property, he must make every effort to contact the owner and invite him or his designated agent or representative to accompany him on his actual field inspection. If personal contact is not possible, a registered letter should be sent to the owner. The appraisal report should reflect when and how the owner or his representative was contacted, whether or not he accompanied the appraiser, and any other pertinent comments.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Definition of market value.</E> “Under established law the criterion for just compensation is the fair market value of the property at the time of the taking. ‘Fair market value’ is defined as the amount in cash, or on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which in all probability the property would be sold by a knowledgeable owner willing but not obligated to sell to a knowledgeable purchaser who desired but is not obligated to buy. In ascertaining that figure, consideration should be given to all matters that might be brought forward and reasonably be given substantial weight in bargaining by persons of ordinary prudence, but no consideration whatever should be given to matters not affecting market value. The cash or on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, requirement is important and numerous courts have noted this factor.” (Source: “Uniform Appraisal Standards For Federal Land Acquisitions,” Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, Washington, DC, 1973.) This definition is considered to be consistent with another definition approved by the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers which sets out market value “as the highest price estimated in terms of money which a property will bring if exposed for sale in the open market, allowing a reasonable time to find a purchaser who buys with knowledge of all the uses to which it is adapted and for which it is capable of being used.”</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of appraisal procedures.</E> (1) The appraisal of real estate is the estimation of the fair market value of a specified interest in a particular ownership of property, and the appraisal profession has developed certain basic appraisal techniques and procedures. There are three approaches to value which have become standardized—the cost approach; the market approach; and the income approach.</P>

                <P>(2) In the COST APPROACH, the appraiser estimates the cost of reproduction of the buildings and land improvements. A deduction is made for depreciation due to physical deterioration, and also for functional and economic obsolescence. The value of the land is <PRTPAGE P="114"/>then estimated by comparison with sales of similar unimproved tracts and added to the depreciated value of the improvements. This procedure is also referred to as the Summation Approach. This approach is always applicable in the valuation of publicly owned structures such as schools, fire houses, etc.</P>
                <P>(3) In the MARKET APPROACH, the appraiser compares the subject property on an overall basis with similar properties which have recently sold. Adjustments are made for all factors of dissimilarity. All known sales are considered, but the appraiser selects only those which are verified to be good “arms length transactions” and considered to be most similar to the property appraised. After these sales are analyzed and adjusted to the subject, this data is then correlated into a final estimate of value as indicated by the market.</P>
                <P>(4) In the INCOME APPROACH, the appraiser estimates the probable gross and net income to be expected from the rental of the property, adjusts for the quality and durability of this income stream, and processes this income into a value estimate by use of an appropriate capitalization rate.</P>
                <P>(5) The appraiser then correlates the indicated value estimates from the three approaches into a final estimated market value. Consideration is given to the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Normally, the most weight is given to the approach commonly used by the typical purchasers of the type of property appraised. In almost all routine appraisals the market approach is most applicable.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Importance of the appraisal function.</E> The measure of success or failure in any real estate transaction is inseparably bound up in the matter of price. The heart of the real estate business is the price estimate or appraisal. The importance of sound appraisals for the Department of the Army cannot be over-emphasized. The courts have established basic rules governing exercise of the power of eminent domain.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Appraisal is an “Estimate.”</E> The market value of any real estate interest is not a matter of exact determination, and the appraiser does not “establish” or “determine” the value. An appraisal is an “estimate” of current value based upon and supported by an analysis of all the factors, physical, economic, and social which influence the present and future benefits to be derived from the ownership of the property appraised.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">The appraisal format.</E> In order to establish a degree of uniformity throughout the Corps as to an appraisal format, all staff appraisers and contract appraisers will follow the outline as set forth in the “Uniform Appraisal Standards For Federal Land Acquisition” and § 644.42.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Preface.</E> The appraisal report is an important document which serves as a material aid in the acquisition of required real estate interests. It is also an indispensable factor in justifying expenditures of public funds. It is essential that the report indicates conclusively that the appraiser has considered and analyzed all available data and used logical reasoning and judgment in developing his value conclusions.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of reports.</E> (1) It is the Corps' practice that all appraisal reports will be prepared in narrative form. The report will include, as a minimum, all essential data which will disclose the purpose, the scope of the problem and the principal techniques and approaches employed. The report should contain all the pertinent supporting data required to sustain the appraiser's final conclusion of market value.</P>
                <P>(2) The use of preprinted narrative sales data sheets is authorized. Care should be exercised to properly relate each sale to subject in the narrative. Use of individual forms is also authorized for tabular exercises, such as the “cost approach.” In every instance the narrative should reflect the appraiser's reasoning.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Narrative report format.</E> (1) The following report format is taken verbatim from “Uniform Appraisal Standards For Federal Land Acquisitions,” published by the Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, 1973.

                <P>(2) The following exceptions are made to the above format:</P>
                <P>(i) Estate, either a copy of the estate appraised should be included in the report or by reference in the report to the appropriate estate.</P>
                <P>(ii) Legal description must be included in the appraisal report, either in the body or as an exhibit.</P>
                <P>(3) Photographs of important buildings and unusual land conditions are considered an integral part of each appraisal report. Judgment should be exercised in conserving time and expense, and several small buildings can often be covered in one photograph. The use of color film and photographs is encouraged, especially wherein development cost either “in-house” or by outside firms is reasonable.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Brief appraisals.</E> (1) Brief narrative appraisal reports, of a one-to-four page composition, are authorized for use in many instances wherein the evaluation or per annum rental value does not exceed $3,600. The use of this type of report is encouraged and authorized for:</P>
                <P>(i) Family housing appraisals,</P>
                <P>(ii) Inleasing of privately-owned quarters and outleasing of government-owned quarters to civilian tenants,</P>

                <P>(vii) Other minor interests in real property.</P>
                <P>(2) Appraisals exceeding $2,000 per annum rental are subject to the Economy Act, and the fee value must be shown if improvements are included. A brief or short form-type of appraisal is adequate.</P>
                <P>(3) All appraisals will be supported by at least three comparable sales or rentals of similar properties. A narrative discussion of each will be included. In bulk acquisition projects the use of prepared sales data sheets is authorized and encouraged. Each sale or rental must be discussed and compared to the subject property within the narrative of the report.</P>
                <P>(4) Brief narrative appraisals will be reviewed under the same requirements as normal appraisal reports.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Preparation.</E> (1) The gross appraisal sections of real estate design memoranda and planning reports are subject to minute scrutiny by higher authority in the Department of Defense and by Congressional Committees. It is essential that they be meticulously prepared to reflect actual market conditions and unit prices.</P>

                <P>(2) Each gross appraisal will be supported by detailed analyses of an adequate number of typical comparable sales. Each index sale will be analyzed to show various land classifications <PRTPAGE P="117"/>and values, building contribution estimates and other relevant information. The sales prices should be verified by someone having knowledge of the transaction.</P>
                <P>(3) Where letter-type or brief real estate design memoranda on civil works projects are submitted, comparable sales data will be presented in one of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(i) Be submitted within the report in a brief manner, with at least three truly comparable sales discussed in narrative form and comparisons shown to the subject lands covered by the memorandum.</P>
                <P>(ii) Be referenced to the last real estate design memorandum issued on the same project and if values have changed in the interim, additional sales data submitted to support the changes. If the last design memorandum is over a year old, new supporting data must be submitted.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Fee appraisals.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions and procedures.</E> (1) The complete and unrestricted ownership of all the rights to the full use and enjoyment of a parcel of real estate is called the “fee simple estate.” An appraisal of this interest is referred to as “Fee Value.”</P>
                <P>(2) Most fee appraisals require the use of all three of the standard appraisal approaches.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Appraisals of the fair market value of the free and clear fee title to the subject property is necessary in the greatest majority of the Corps of Engineers' real estate responsibilities be it acquisition (full or partial), disposal, inleasing, outleasing, rentals, etc. In almost every case the monetary value of the required estate and interest is based on the fee value of the property; therefore, the Corps' greatest appraisal requirement is for fee appraisals.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Approaches.</E> (1) It is recommended that whenever possible all three of the standard appraisal approaches, Cost-Market-Income, be used in a fee appraisal. However, if due to the type of property, is is not practical, beneficial, or necessary to use a particular approach, the appraiser is required to indicate in his report that consideration was given to its use and discuss why it was not used.</P>
                <P>(2) In the Cost Approach it is extremely important that the appraiser document all items of costs for development, construction, utilities, etc. It also is extremely important that he fully consider all forms of depreciation such as physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, economic obsolescence, etc., and justify his methods and factors used in developing his depreciation factors.</P>
                <P>(3) The Market Approach or Comparative method of appraisal is the most direct approach to a market value estimate and is preferred above all others. It is basically an application of the principle of substitution wherein the sales of similar type properties are analyzed to develop a price at which an equally desirable and similar property can be obtained. It involves the collection and analyzing of current sales of comparable properties and comparing these sales to the subject property. Since no two properties are identical, the appraiser must make adjustments for differences between the two. Adjustments may be by a dollar amount (per unit, per acre, or lump sum) or on a percentage basis. Full support and justification must be given for each amount. Adjustments may be shown either by a tabular analysis or by a narrative discussion.</P>
                <P>(4) The market value of an income-producing property is quite often governed by the net income it will produce. The fair market value may be estimated by developing the expected net income and processing it into a value estimate by use of an appropriate capitalization rate. The keynote of this approach lies in the sound development of a proper rate. The appraiser must have a basic knowledge of the principle and techniques involved and must be certain that he has adequate data to develop this rate and properly process the income into a fair market value.</P>

                <P>(5) It is most important that the valuation estimates developed by all of the approaches used are correlated into one conclusive value. In those cases where there is a substantial spread among values, the appraiser is cautioned to recheck all his data and figures for accuracy. The cost figures and <PRTPAGE P="118"/>depreciation factors should be checked in the Cost Approach; the sales data should be further documented and analyzed in the Market Approach; and the Income Method may require a recheck of the soundness of the capitalization rate.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Partial takings.</E> (1) A substantial number of acquisitions require only portions of an ownership necessitating a “partial taking.” In these cases the appraiser is required to estimate the value of the whole ownership before the taking; the value of the remainder—the difference being the value of the part taken. Many times the remainder is of less value after the taking, indicating a “severance damage.” The appraiser is usually required to allocate the total taking value between the value of the part acquired and the severance damage to the remainder by reason of the taking.</P>
                <P>(2) In order to promote uniformity in the reporting format, the following example of the “before” and “after” method is presented for guidance:</P>

                <P>(3) The appraisal of the property before the taking must be a complete narrative-type appraisal containing adequate market data to support the total value. The report then must also include a full appraisal on the remainder portion of the property consisting of a full description of the residue immediately after the taking and a complete set of market data and sales other than those used in the “before” evaluation. If the remainder parcel has diminished in value as a result of the taking, the appraiser must have adequate support and justification for the reduction in value.</P>
                <P>(4) In the case of partial takings, consideration must also be given to offsetting benefits applicable to the remaining property. A combination of legal interpretation of the law and judicial decisions with regard to such benefits must be used in determining whether offsetting benefits are applicable. Reference is made to paragraph A-9 and A-10 in the “Uniform Appraisal Standards For Federal Land Acquisitions.”</P>
                <P>(5) Paragraph A-13 of the “Uniform Appraisal Standards” is also referenced in connection with guidance regarding “navigation servitude.”</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Appraisal Certificate.</E> (1) No appraisal report will be considered acceptable without appropriate certification by the appraiser responsible for the contents of the report and the conclusion of values. The certification can be in the front or the back of the report, consistent with Division or District policy.</P>

                <P>(2) An appropriate certification shall be substantially in accordance with the following: I certify that I have carefully examined the property described herein and that the estimates as developed in the report represent my unbiased opinion and judgment. I further certify that I have no interest, past, present or prospective, in the subject property which would affect my opinion and that the present fair market value of the (<E T="03">insert estate appraisal</E>) is subject only to all the assumptions and limitations as specifically set forth. (Date and signature of appraiser.)</P>

                <SUBJECT>Rental value.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> (1) The fair rental value of the property is the amount which, in a competitive market, a well-informed and willing lessee would pay and which a well-informed and willing lessor would accept for the temporary use and enjoyment of the property.</P>
                <P>(2) Appraisals to establish fair rental values will be made in accordance with acceptable standards of appraisal applicable to the particular type of property and in accordance with general appraisal practices and procedures heretofore described in relating to all appraisal work. The preparation of time-consuming and lengthy appraisal reports should be kept to a minimum, particularly with regard to rental properties of low value. A brief summary of the essential facts will be sufficient to support leases by the Government of building space or unimproved land where the net rental value is not in excess of $3,600 per annum.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> All provisions of this subpart are applicable to “inleasing” of <PRTPAGE P="119"/>real property for use of the Government, and equally applicable to “outleasing” of Government-owned real property. Section 644.45(l) Government Quarters, is normally applicable only to “outleasing” of quarters to civilian employees. The provisions are, however, also considered valid considerations in appraising “inleases,” wherein privately-owned housing is being rented for occupancy by military personnel in lieu of quarters allowances.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Services.</E> In the absence of an agreement or contract, a lessor is not bound to furnish any utilities or building services of any kind, and such services may not be acquired under the power of eminent domain. It is, therefore, necessary for the appraiser to include in his report as separate items the estimated cost of all customary services that may be required to permit the normal use and occupancy of the property.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Market value of fee.</E> (1) Where temporary use of an entire building or other independent unit of an ownership is proposed, the appraisal will ordinarily report both the market value of the fee title and the fair annual rental value. However, no appraisal of fair market value of fee title is required in any case where assessed value, supported by statement of the assessor and ENG Form 869-R (15% Valuation Certificate), can be used for compliance with existing law, Section 322 of the Act of June 30, 1932 (40 U.S.C. 278a), known as the “Economy Act.” Fee value is not required for land only leases, as the Economy Act is not applicable.</P>
                <P>(2) An exception to the above procedure is in regard to the appraisal of family housing units. As an alternative, the appraiser can support his rental valuation by use of comparable rentals and a statement that the lease value does not exceed 15% of the fair market value.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Lease of minor portions of buildings.</E> Where appraisals are required to establish rental value of a minor portion of a building, it will not be necessary to estimate the fee value of the entire property, provided that the net annual rental does not exceed $2,000. A sound rental value can ordinarily be estimated by comparison with established rentals in subject property and in adjacent similar properties in the community. However, care should be exercised to insure the reasonableness of the reported comparable rental values. The appraiser's report must include sufficient data on these current rentals to support adequately the rental estimate for the subject space.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Unexpired lease.</E> Where the premises to be acquired are occupied by tenants under leases which cannot be terminated at will by the landlord, the appraiser's report will set forth in detail the terms of the existing leases and will show the value of the tenant's interest. The value of the tenant's interest is based on the fair rental value (economic rent) of the part of the property occupied by the tenant for the unexpired term of the lease, or for the term condemned, whichever is shorter, less the rent which the tenant is obligated to pay (contract rent) under the existing lease. The difference between the economic and contract rent is known as “bonus rent.”</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Bonus value.</E> Wherein a “bonus rent” is reflected as being the difference between economic and contract rent, a full narrative discussion will be included in the report. It is of paramount importance that the present economic rental be supported by the rental market data. The “bonus value” is the present worth of the discounted bonus rent.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Rental appraisal report.</E> The appraisal report will contain adequate facts and discussions relative to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Land description, showing street frontages and lot depths.</P>
                <P>(2) Adequate description of improvements and furnishings, including type of construction, total floor space, floor load for storage space, number of rentable rooms, or income-producing space, nonproductive or public space, total cubic content, and reproduction cost of improvements less depreciation.</P>
                <P>(3) Assessed valuation and lawful ratio to market value, if the annual rental value exceeds $2,000.</P>

                <P>(4) Analysis and discussions of current rentals of similar properties and rental history of the property appraised.<PRTPAGE P="120"/>
                </P>
                <P>(5) Discussion of the appraisal process and rental rates applicable to the terms of the proposed lease, particularly as to any differential in the rate of return applicable to customary long term rentals.</P>
                <P>(6) Statement showing distribution of appraised annual rental as allocated to fixed charges and fair rate of return on land, buildings, and any furnishings or equipment that are included in the proposed taking.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Special purpose properties.</E> Appraisals to estimate the rental value of hotels, clubs, hospitals, and other highly specialized properties will include full information on the income capacity of the property under average competent management and under accepted standards of operation for the particular type of property involved. The appraisal reports will, among other things, contain an analysis and discussion of the following items:</P>
                <P>(1) Financial history of property, including indebtedness, the actual past income or earnings of the property based upon audit reports for the past five years or longer, and any unaudited current months of the fiscal year. In the absence of audits, corporate statements may be furnished if properly certified.</P>
                <P>(2) Discussion of the past operation and management methods with comments relative to any excessive or insufficient charges appearing in the financial statements obtained.</P>
                <P>(3) Appraiser's estimate of the stabilized income of the property.</P>
                <P>(4) Appraiser's estimate of profits available for typical lessee-operator.</P>
                <P>(5) Recommendations of the appraiser as to the relative merits of acquiring fee title to the property as against acquiring a leasehold interest.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Farms and rural properties.</E> Appraisals to estimate the rental value of farms and other types of rural properties will report the present market value of the fee title, the fair annual rental value, and any direct damage to growing crops, standing timber, or improvements to be removed or destroyed. The damage will be reported separately from the rental value in order to permit the reflection of the damage in the primary rental term.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Industrial installations.</E> (1) Appraisal reports will be obtained to support all leases of industrial installations or portions thereof. It is important that appraisals of operating industrial installations be prepared by specially qualified appraisers or consultants intimately familiar with the particular processes and production capabilities and related factors having any bearing on the value of a particular plant.</P>
                <P>(2) The appraisers selected to estimate the rental value should be fully informed as to all known prospective lessees and the amount of any bids, or offers made for the use of the property, and as to all terms, conditions, and limitations under which the property will be made available for use or operation.</P>

                <P>(3) The appraisal reports will include a detailed inventory setting forth all physical factors pertaining to the land, buildings, machinery, and equipment and an adequate discussion of all local factors influencing the profitable use of the facility. Data pertinent to the prevailing rentals for other Government and privately-owned industrial plants and warehouses considered reasonably similar to the facilities to be leased will also be included. The conclusions of the appraiser as to other matters of importance to the Department of the Army in its leasing operations will likewise be presented. The appraiser should bear in mind that idle manufacturing plants, and all industrial properties, as a general rule, are valuable only to the extent and degree that they are usable in actual production. It is also a generally accepted economic fact that the plant and fixed equipment (real estate) is the production factor for which a return can ordinarily be realized after the cost of all other factors in production has been provided. Military necessity has required the construction of many plants which are designed for special purposes and which may tend to defeat the ordinary approaches to the market rental value problem. In the absence of comparable rentals of similar properties or other reliable comparative guides to value for temporary use, market rental <PRTPAGE P="121"/>value should be estimated with particular consideration to the following methods:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Reasonable return on estimated fair value.</E> For this purpose “fair value” is defined as the prudent cost of reproduction less depreciation of only that portion of the property that is readily adaptable or capable of competition with alternative properties which may be available to or constructed by the proposed lessees. Items of equipment and any portions of a plant that do not directly contribute to the specific use may be eliminated from consideration and the rental return estimated only on items and space actually adaptable for use in the proposed enterprise. The appraiser is particularly concerned with any competitive disadvantages or penalties accruing to subject property by comparison with the alternatives available to prospective users. The rental estimate should therefore be appropriately modified with respect to adequate allowances for amortization of necessary alterations to be made by the lessee. Other operating disadvantages that might tend, from the competitive viewpoint, to result in increased operating cost or other penalties that might in any way be brought forward in negotiations to establish an acceptable rental price must also be considered.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Ratio of plant costs to productive capacity.</E> In many lines of industrial enterprise, it may be possible to obtain comparable operating experience ratios with reference to relation of average annual real estate costs or plant investment charges to the gross annual production. The difficulties of estimating production levels and obtaining sufficiently accurate data as to actual operating experience are fully appreciated. Suggested sources of such information are annual statements of prospective lessees and their competitors. It is believed that this approach to the appraisal problem is fundamentally sound, particularly so when there is an indicated demand for the full capacity of an industrial plant as originally designed, and that this method will serve as a reasonable check and balance against return on “fair value.” It should also be very helpful as a guide to the rate of capitalization in the “fair value” approach to the rental problem.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Taxes.</E> The appraisal will not be influenced by the fact that the Government is not presently required to pay taxes on the property.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Savings.</E> When appropriate, the estimated savings in maintenance, protection, repair and restoration, if any, will be obtained by the Management and Disposal Branch from the using service or other competent authority and furnished to the appraiser preparing the appraisal report.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Government quarters.</E> (1) Rental schedules for Government quarters furnished to civilian employees will be supported by written appraisal reports reflecting adequate coverage of the following items:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Construction details.</E> Physical description of quarters will include the general grade of construction work, materials and decorations, number of rooms, floor space, porches, garages, general appearance and condition.</P>

Typical rental rates will be compiled, analyzed and tabulated, and subject properties identified and described in the same manner as prescribed above for Government quarters.

I am not now a tenant residing in such quarters nor do I have any intention of becoming a tenant therein.”</P>
                <P>(2) Reappraisals of rental quarters are required every fifth year subsequent to previous appraisal. Rental rates will be adjusted annually between appraisals by application of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, and as further required in accordance with Transmittal Memorandum No. 2, OMB Circular A-45, revised October 30, 1974.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Easements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> An easement is a property right of specified use and enjoyment falling short of fee ownership. It follows that the value of an easement is less than the market value of fee title to the same portion of property (exclusive of severance damages to residual portions).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Measure of value.</E> The measure of compensation for an easement is the amount by which market value of the ownership is diminished by the imposition of the easement. This should be developed by use of the “before” and “after” method of appraisal, the difference being the value of the taking.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Flowage easements.</E> (1) The appraisal of flowage easements will not be undertaken until flood frequency surveys have been completed and approved by proper authority. The flood frequency data will be made available to the appraisers with the definite understanding that it is to be accepted as one of the controlling factors in estimating the market value of the easements. The appraiser's certificate should be qualified to include the assumption that the frequency data is correct and that he has no responsibility therefore.</P>
                <P>(2) The market value of fee simple title to each property over which a flowage easement is required will first be appraised in the usual manner. This estimate will be followed by appraisal of the market value of the property after imposition of the easement. The market value of the easement is then computed on the basis of the amount the market value of fee title is reduced by imposition of the easement. The appraiser will give full consideration to all factors having a bearing on the reduction in value of the parcel on which the easement is to be imposed. Each appraisal report will include complete information as to estimated flood frequency pertaining to each parcel appraised.</P>

                <P>(3) The appraiser's major problem in appraising tracts having considerable value is the development of his value estimate after the imposition of the easement. The market data approach to value is limited in this phase of the appraisal to index sales of land reflecting the “use adaptability” of lands to a less profitable purpose. Typical of such change in highest and best use are the conversion of row crop land and orchard land to pasture and forestry. Likewise, the cost approach to value is applicable only to land improvements <PRTPAGE P="123"/>and structures to be removed or destroyed. It is, therefore, considered essential that flowage easement appraisals reflect, in adequate detail, changes in utility by the development and use of the earnings approach to value before and after imposition in all cases involving lands capable of producing income. The ratios thus developed in “before” and “after” values for income producing lands should prove to be helpful in developing appropriate ratios for nonproductive lands.</P>
                <P>(4) In those instances where the type of land, topography, flood frequency and duration data clearly indicate that a minimal change in value (not to exceed $100) will result from exercise of the required rights, a brief appraisal is authorized. The appraisal report will contain as a minimum a complete statement of pertinent facts, including information regarding flood frequency and duration data pertaining to the property appraised. In the event condemnation is required to acquire the necessary rights, an acceptable “before” and “after” appraisal will be prepared prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings.</P>
                <P>(5) A tract map showing each contour level of varying flood frequency will be made a part of each appraisal report. This map should facilitate review of the appraisals and serve as an aid to the negotiator in his contacts.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Other easements.</E> It is recognized that many other types of easements, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, road, pipeline, restrictive, borrow, transmission line, flight, spoil, etc. are to be appraised. In all instances, the measure of value is still the same, the amount by which the market value of the ownership is diminished by the imposition.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Appraisal of other interests.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Minerals.</E> (1) In all cases, the value of the subsurface will be included or accounted for in the appraisal report in such manner that negotiations may be readily conducted to acquire or extinguish subsurface rights if they are outstanding in third parties or if it develops that the vendors desire to reserve them. In those instances where minerals are held separately in large blocks underlying several individual surface tracts, a statement to this effect should be included and the plan for appraising the mineral estate identified. Unless the person who is appraising the surface has had training and experience in appraising minerals, the subsurface appraisal should be made separately by an appraiser qualified to perform this service. Since the removal of certain minerals may destroy the usefulness of the surface, care should be exercised to avoid duplication of value.</P>
                <P>(2) In the event that subsurface valuation is unfamiliar to the Division or District requiring same, HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314 should be contacted for advice and recommendations. Mineral valuation engineers within the Corps may be utilized on a cost reimburseable basis for furnishing gross or tract appraisals.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Timber.</E> (1) Where the land being appraised has only young trees or timber not of merchantable size, the value thereof will be included with the value of the land. If the timber is of merchantable size, a timber cruise will be made by a professional forester and the timber classified in the appraisal according to species, type, range of size, quantity, unit value, and total value. A discussion of logging, haulage, and market conditions will be given. The total value of timber shall be the amount by which the timber enhances the market value of the bare land.</P>
                <P>(2) Extreme care must be exercised in the use of separate timber estimates for appraising timber land, so as to avoid “doubling up.” Where a timber cruise or estimate is used, comparable sales of recently timbered land should be used to support the remaining land value. Where such sales are not available, care must be utilized to extract the timber value from sales of timber land. The optimum situation would be to have sales that were also cruised; however, this does not often happen.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Growing crops.</E> (1) Crop appraisals will not ordinarily be necessary except in those cases where the Division or District has determined that possession of the cropland is necessary prior to the normal harvest period. Where the Division or District Engineer has determined that the landowner or his tenant cannot be permitted to harvest <PRTPAGE P="124"/>the crops, they will be appraised as separate property items.</P>
                <P>(2) The crop appraisal will identify the crops by type, number of acres, estimated yield per acre taking into account all hazards, the unit value, gross market value at maturity based upon current local prices for the commodities less cost of bringing to maturity, harvest, and delivering to available markets. The expected harvest period will be reported, together with other pertinent information, in order to indicate an approximate date when the cropland may be available for construction purposes.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of Government-owned property.</E> (1) An appraisal will be made, when required, to justify the consideration reserved in all leases, licenses and easements, except those specifically mentioned in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The appraisal will be made in accordance with acceptable standards applicable to the particular type of property and the use to be made thereof in the proposed grant, and in accordance with the general appraisal practices and standards heretofore outlined in this chapter. Ordinarily the appraisals of property involving substantial improvements will include, in addition to complete coverage of all factors influencing the use of the property appraised, complete information as to the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Data of acquisition and completion of Government construction.</P>
                <P>(ii) Complete cost data as to original purchase price and Government construction.</P>
                <P>(iii) Detailed discussion of the predominant uses to which the property is adaptable.</P>
                <P>(iv) Competitive position of the property with respect to availability of privately-owned properties for similar use.</P>
                <P>(v) Estimate of market value of fee title.</P>
                <P>(vi) Estimate of annual rental value assuming unrestricted use over a reasonable period of time.</P>
                <P>(vii) Estimate of annual rental value under proposed Government restrictions.</P>

                <P>(2) Time consuming and lengthy appraisal reports should be avoided in the case of low value grants involving Government-owned property. The consideration in such cases may be substantiated by a simplified appraisal report by a qualified appraiser setting forth only such facts as are required to validate his conclusions as to value. In such instances, a physical inspection of the property may be waived where the appraiser is sufficiently familiar with the property under appraisals and local market conditions to prepare a reasonable value estimate of the estate to be appraised. When a property is not physically inspected, it will be so noted in the appraisal report. The decision concerning the necessity for a physical inspection of the property and analyzing local market conditions will rest with the appraiser signing the appraisal certificate since he is personally responsible for the value conclusion developed in the appraisal report. A low value grant for the purpose of this paragraph is defined as any grant for which the fair market rental value (before applying any offset in rental for estimated savings in maintenance, protection, repair and restoration) does not exceed the following:

                <P>(3) The following are exempt from the above requirements:</P>
                <P>(i) Leases for land on which to construct new credit union facilities, under long-term leases. See DOD Directive No. 1000.10 for formula.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Review and approval.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (1) Upon completion of an appraisal, the signed report is to be reviewed by a reviewing appraiser to assure that the information and data developed by the appraiser substantiates the estimated valuation. The review function also serves as a means of resolving differences that might be found in two or more individual appraisals of a single property. The reviewing appraiser is also responsible for maintaining consistency in appraisals for the various properties in a project.</P>

                <P>(2) A review of all real estate appraisals is considered of vital importance to <PRTPAGE P="125"/>the successful operation of the real estate mission of the Corps of Engineers. It is essential that each and every appraisal be given an independent review and check by a thoroughly qualified reviewing appraiser. This will insure that the appraisal represents relative concurrence as to value of not less than two real estate appraisers professionally qualified by previous experience in appraising the particular type of property involved. The reviewing appraiser should familiarize himself with the property to the extent that he can adequately present and support his opinion when called upon to do so.</P>
                <P>(3) The review action will be documented by a separate narrative memorandum signed and dated by the authorized reviewing appraiser. Such review memorandum will indicate, but not be limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Date and nature of physical inspection of the subject property.</P>
                <P>(ii) Statement relative to reviewer's knowledge of comparable sales used.</P>
                <P>(iii) Reviewer's opinion as to the appraiser's valuation.</P>
                <P>(iv) Other pertinent data, if any, relative to the property or comparable sales that the reviewer feels would lend additional credence to value estimate.</P>
                <P>(v) Reviewer's certification of approval, disapproval, or recommendation.</P>
                <P>(4) If more than one appraisal is obtained for an ownership, all should be reviewed by the same reviewing appraiser. The reviewer can cover all appraisals in one review memorandum, or write individual reviews.</P>
                <P>(5) No alterations or additions will be made to a signed appraisal report by anyone other than the appraiser who signed the report. A reviewer cannot change the value reflected or approve an amount other than the appraiser's final conclusion of value. His alternative is disapproval.</P>
                <P>(6) A reviewing appraiser may not review other appraisal reports covering a property that he has himself previously appraised. In this instance the reports must be assigned to another reviewer or be forwarded to the next level of review for appropriate action.</P>
                <P>(7) Appraisal reports obtained by the Department of Justice and submitted for Corps review are to be treated in the same manner as those obtained by the Corps.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Delegation.</E> (1) Division Engineers have been authorized to approve or take action as appropriate on all real estate appraisal reports made for the purpose of purchase, disposal, or any use of real property in which the estimated fair market value (of the part to be acquired, if a partial taking) does not exceed $250,000, or the estimated fair market rental value does not exceed $150,000 per annum.</P>
                <P>(2) Division Engineers have been authorized further, at their discretion, to redelegate any part of this authority, up to $150,000, to District Engineers.</P>
                <P>(3) All appraisals exceeding $250,000 will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314 for final review, approval, and/or appropriate action. Each report will be thoroughly reviewed at all levels, including the Project, District and Division.</P>
                <P>(4) A copy of all those reports between $100,000 and $250,000 will be forwarded to DAEN-REE for post review and retention.</P>
                <P>(5) In addition to those reports which exceed the delegated authority, DAEN-REE will review and take appropriate action on complex, difficult and controversial appraisals. Where more than one appraisal has been made within either of these categories, a copy of each appraisal report should be submitted for review regardless of variances in opinions of value. At times, the Division Engineers may receive specific instructions as to appraisals which may require final approval of DAEN-REE. Also, from time to time, DAEN-REE may call for and review typical appraisals prepared by individual appraisers.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reconciliation of appraisal reports.</E> In the event that a reviewing appraiser does not agree with the value conclusion of the appraiser, the following steps should be taken:</P>
                <P>(1) Attempt to reconcile differences with the appriser in a face-to-face meeting. The reviewing appraiser should present his additional evidence of value to the appraiser and discuss the report weaknesses, if any.</P>

                <P>(2) In the event reconciliation and approval are not possible, the reviewer <PRTPAGE P="126"/>must then forward the report and review certificate to higher authority for resolution and request that another appraisal be obtained.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualifications of reviewing appraisers.</E> (1) A reviewing appraiser should have a minimum of five years experience in the field of real estate appraising. He should also have taken and successfully completed two or more appraisal courses offered by professional appraisal organizations. His experience record should indicate that he has thorough knowledge of all the standard appraisal techniques and approaches and has the ability to analyze the market and all pertinent data which affects value.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon selection and appointment by the District Engineer of qualified staff personnel to act as reviewing appraisers, a copy of their qualifications and experience records, along with a copy of the appointing orders, will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Code of ethics.</E> Under no circumstances will an appraiser be directed to make an appraisal at any predetermined amount or to change his opinion of value on any property appraised. It is recognized that the review function will develop some differences of opinion. However, where those differences cannot be resolved on a higher ethical basis, predicated upon sound reasoning and adequate data properly analyzed and applied, an additional appraisal will be obtained.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Contracts.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Appraisal reports.</E> (1) Within their contract authority, Division and District Engineers may contract with recognized appraisal firms, corporations and individuals for necessary appraisal reports on a lump sum basis. Following the award of any appraisal contract in excess of $5,000 a copy of such contract will be forwarded by the issuing office direct to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314, immediately upon execution.</P>
                <P>(2) Requests from Division and District Engineers to the Chief of Engineers for names of appraisers qualified to make particularly complex appraisals are invited.</P>
                <P>(3) Division and District Engineers will develop and maintain current lists of qualified appraisal firms, corporations and individuals, from which contractor selection will be made. These lists should be appropriately grouped or rated in accordance with special qualifications and experience in connection with various and specific types of appraisal problems.</P>
                <P>(4) Prior to receipt of proposals and negotiations with appraisers, a target fee (Government estimate) will be developed with due consideration to the relative skill and ability required in solving the appraisal problem and the appraiser's time and expense required for preparing the desired reports.</P>
                <P>(5) In the negotiation of appraisal contracts the following items are to be considered:</P>
                <P>(i) The appraisal of real estate is a recognized profession governed by a code of ethics prohibiting competition in obtaining appraisal assignments. All negotiations for proposals will be conducted on an individual basis, with adequately qualified appraisal firms, corporations or individuals competent to deliver the required appraisal reports on schedule.</P>
                <P>(ii) In view of the technical nature of appraisals, Division and District Engineers shall give consideration to designating qualified member(s) of their real estate staffs as contracting officer's representative(s) with full responsibility for all cost estimates involved in contracting for appraisal services and reports. Such contracting officer's representative(s) may also, in the designation of the contracting officer, be utilized to conduct negotiations with the prospective contractors, serve as ordering officer pursuant to the contracts, certify invoices and act in any other capacity within their authority as contracting officer's representative(s).</P>
                <P>(6) A copy of the narrative, detailed record of contract negotiations will be forwarded to DAEN-REE, along with the contract as specified above.</P>

                <P>(7) In contracting for appraisal reports, contract forms as set forth in Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR) (chapter I of this title) and ER 1180-1-1 (Engineer Contract Instructions) will be used. An outline of the qualifications of the appraiser employed to perform the contemplated <PRTPAGE P="127"/>services shall be included in the contract assembly.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Expert appraisal services.</E> Employment of qualified real estate appraisers and consultants may be effected utilizing the pertinent provisions of ASPR and ER 1180-1-1.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Obtaining appraisal reports by purchase order.</E> (1) Division and District Engineers are urged to utilize an authorized type of purchase order, such as DD Form 1155, in lieu of long-form contract, provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) It is in the best interest of the Government, cost wise, not to issue the long-form contract.</P>
                <P>(ii) The contractor has performed satisfactorily on at least one contract within the prior three fiscal years.</P>
                <P>(iii) The total order, by such purchase orders, from the contractor does not exceed $10,000 for the project during the current fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(iv) The order is accompanied by a brief history of negotiation signed by both the contractor and the contracting officer's representative(s).</P>
                <P>(2) Care should be exercised to insure that the above provisions are used only to order supplementary reports, single appraisals, and other “one-time” reports needed.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Sections 644.61 through 644.72 describe the procedures relating to the procurement of title evidence, title clearance, and closings for the acquisition of real estate and interests therein for all land acquisition programs administered by the Chief of Engineers. Exceptions in connection with the acquisition of properties under the Homeowners Assistance Program are set forth in subpart E.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> These sections are applicable to all Division and District Engineers having real estate responsibility.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Guidelines.</E> (1) The satisfactory progress of land acquisition programs necessitates the prompt procurement of title evidence and prompt title clearance. One of the following types of title evidence should be obtained, after considering the cost of the several types and other factors mentioned below. To effect these objectives, careful planning is essential, including a determination of the most acceptable and available type of title evidence and the source from which such title evidence may be procured. The Chief of Engineers is responsible for procuring all title evidence, including title evidence needed for lands which are acquired by condemnation proceedings. The early procurement and examination of the title evidence and title clearance will expedite payment to landowners from whom offers are obtained or against whom condemnation proceedings are filed.</P>
                  <P>(2) Insured certificates of title or policies of title insurance shall be obtained wherever possible. This is on the theory that the Government is buying title searching service as well as the title evidence itself and is avoiding the time and cost of examining abstracts of title, generally voluminous in nature.</P>

                  <P>(3) Where it is not possible to obtain certificates of title or title insurance, <PRTPAGE P="128"/>abstracts of title may be obtained, as a last resort.</P>
                  <P>(4) As used in these sections, an abstract of title is a synopsis or digest of all instruments of record affecting the title to a specific parcel of land. It neither guarantees nor insures the title. A certificate of title is a contract whereby a title company certifies that title to a specific parcel of land is good and unencumbered of record in a named person excepting only such defects and encumbrances as are shown therein. The liability of the company is limited to an amount specified in the certificate. A title insurance policy is a contract which insures that the owner or mortgagee will not suffer any loss or damage by reason of defects in the title to the property, or liens or encumbrances thereon existing at the date of the policy, except those defects, liens, or encumbrances which the policy specifically excepts. Liability thereunder is not limited to matters of record but extends to matters beyond the record.</P>
                  <P>(5) The Directory of the American Land Title Association may be obtained upon request to the Association at 1828 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036, or to any major title insurance company. This Directory lists, by States, the abstract and title companies which provide title insurance. These companies are acceptable to the Attorney General. Requests for furnishing title certificates or title insurance should be made to the major title insurance companies in addition to local abstractors and title companies.</P>
                  <P>(6) From past experience, it is considered that the procurement of certificates of title or title insurance is more economical than abstracts of title and the use of these types of title evidence expedites payment to landowners. In the majority of the States either certificates of title or title insurance are obtainable and the premium for issuance of such certificates or policies is based on a schedule of fees approved by the State Insurance Commission or some similar State agency. The premium fixed by such schedules, in most cases, includes the charge for title examination (preliminary certificate of title or preliminary binders) and the charge for insurance (final certificates of title or title guarantee policy) and any variance from the prescribed fees is considered a violation of the Sate law or regulation. Most State Insurance Commissions have recognized and approved the forms of certificates of title and title insurance policies prescribed by the Attorney General and have authorized their use in lieu of owners' policies. Division and District Engineers should familiarize themselves with the State title insurance laws and regulations. If prices quoted by all possible sources seem exorbitant, the matter should be referred to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 for action.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 644.62</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Title evidence.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Acceptable Types of Title Evidence.</E> (1) Certificates of title are acceptable title evidence. Certificates of title must be in a form acceptable to the Attorney General. An acceptable form of certificate of title which has been approved by the Attorney General has been issued by the Chief of Engineers as ENG Form 903, Certificate of Title.</P>
                  <P>(i) In contracting for certificates of title, ENG Form 1016, Specifications for Furnishing and Delivering Certificates of Title Owner's Title Guarantee (Insurance) Policies and Continuations Thereof, will be used.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Any title or abstract company approved by the Department of Justice and authorized and qualified to issue certificates of title in the State where the land is located will be acceptable to furnish certificates of title (Department of Justice “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States, 1970.”) In those few jurisdictions where bar associations or other public or professional bodies hold that the issuance of certificates of title is the issuance of title opinions and therefore the practice of law and where title companies as corporations cannot engage in the practice of law, insured certificates of title may be procured from attorneys, acceptable to the Lands Division of the Department of Justice, acting as agents for title companies. The procedure for the selection of attorneys is set forth in § 644.63(b).</P>

                  <P>(iii) Certificates of title will be based on a search of all records affecting the title to the land and be unqualified as <PRTPAGE P="129"/>to the period of search. In the event that it is not practicable to obtain certificates of title, unqualified as to the period of search, all pertinent facts will be referred to the Department of Justice for consideration and approval.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Certificates of title or title insurance policies shall not limit the liability of the title company to a sum less than 50 percent of the reasonable value of the property. If property is acquired by donation or exchange, the value will be determined by the Corps of Engineers. However, as to acquisitions valued at more than $50,000, the liability of the title company may be limited to 50 percent of the first $50,000 and 25 percent of that portion of the value in excess of that amount. This limitation on the general rule has been approved by the Department of Justice. The appropriate ENG Forms for specifications for supplying title evidence may be amended, if that limited liability can be obtained. A certificate of title or title insurance policy by one title company for a single acquisition valued at more than 25 percent of the admitted assets (after deducting existing liabilities secured or unsecured and excluding any trust or escrow funds) of the issuing company is not acceptable.</P>
                  <P>(v) Generally, it is not necessary to obtain a final certificate of title when land is acquired by condemnation proceedings. However, it may be necessary that an intermediate certificate of title be obtained setting forth the limitation of liability of the title company. Division and District Engineers will be governed by the requirements of the local United States Attorney as to the necessity of obtaining an intermediate or final certificate of title.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Certificates of title, whether preliminary, intermediate, or final, will be procured in sufficient numbers to satisfy the needs of the District involved. Normally an original and two signed copies of each certificate of title will suffice.</P>
                  <P>(vii) The specifications may be supplemented to require the title company to have a local representative stationed convenient to the project office, when, because of the nature of the project (anticipated complexities of title; high purchase prices, or other reasons), it is considered advisable that a local representative be available to perform preclosing interim title searches on request of the Contracting Officer.</P>
                  <P>(viii) The title company's local representative must be authorized to pass on the sufficiency of the proposed deed to the United States; to give final approval of curative material furnished to satisfy title objections set forth in certificates of title; and to testify in court relative to the status of title, if called upon to do so.</P>
                  <P>(2) Title guarantee or title insurance policies are acceptable title evidence.</P>
                  <P>(i) Interim binders on owner's title guarantee or title insurance policies supplemented by an owner's title guarantee policy or title insurance policy in the forms approved by the Attorney General (ENG Form 1014), Interim Binder on Owner's Title Guarantee (Insurance) Policy, and ENG Form 1015, Owner's Title Guarantee (Insurance) Policy will be acceptable as evidence of title only in acquisition in those States where certificates of title may not be issued. ENG Form 3893-R is the form of endorsement for use with the title insurance policies when changes or corrections become necessary. No other substantial variation in the form of interim binder or the form of title guarantee or title insurance policy will be acceptable without prior approval of the Attorney General.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Companies contracting to issue such interim binders or preliminary reports and title guarantee or title insurance policies must have authority under the laws of the State of their incorporation and their charter to issue the same. They must also be financially sound and be willing and able to issue such binders and policies for all tracts for the amount of liability as set forth above.</P>
                  <P>(iii) In contracting for title guarantee or title insurance policies, ENG Form 1016, Specifications for Furnishing and Delivering Certificate of Title Owner's Title Guarantee (Insurance) Policies and Continuations Thereof, will be used.</P>

                  <P>(iv) The interim binder or preliminary report must disclose the title holders of record and contain full information on all matters set forth in the binder as affecting the title. This data <PRTPAGE P="130"/>must be in sufficient detail to enable an attorney examining the report to determine the nature and extent of such matters and their effect on the validity of the title of the land described therein. The contents of the report must meet the requirements of ENG Form 1016.</P>
                  <P>(v) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of this section also apply to title guarantee or title insurance policies.</P>
                  <P>(3) Abstracts of title may be acceptable title evidence.</P>
                  <P>(i) Abstracts if title complying with the rules for abstracts in “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” issued by the Department of Justice, 1970, are acceptable title evidence if prepared by abstractors acceptable to the Attorney General. These may include abstractors employed by a department or agency of the Government. Corps of Engineers personnel generally will not prepare abstracts of title. However, where there is a comparatively small amount of abstract work to be performed, it may be desirable to have the abstracts prepared by qualified Government personnel. In such cases, the prior approval of the Chief of Engineers will be obtained. The request should justify the preparation of abstracts by Government personnel.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The form and contents of abstracts of title will meet the requirements in the “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” (Department of Justice, 1970) and ENG Form 1012, Specifications for Furnishing and Delivering Abstracts of Title.</P>
                  <P>(iii) The period of search of an abstract of title to be acceptable to the Attorney General will, wherever possible, begin with some undisputed source of title such as an original grant or patent from the sovereign. Where it is impossible or impracticable to begin with such grant or patent, refer to “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” (Department of Justice, 1970) and ENG Form 1012 for guidance.</P>
                  <P>(iv) In contracting for abstracts of title, ENG Form 1012 will be used. ENG Form 1012 provides for an unlimited period of search. For the purpose of conserving Government funds and in applicable easement acquisitions, Division and District Engineers are authorized to modify ENG Form 1012 to provide for the minimum period of search allowable under the regulations of the Department of Justice, when deemed to be to the best interest of the Government.</P>
                  <P>(4) Where the consideration to be paid by the Government is $1,000 or less, acquisition in fee may be based upon a title search by a staff attorney when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government. The Preliminary Certificate of Title, ENG Form 909, shall be based upon a search of the local land records beginning with a deed or other instrument transferring title recorded at least 40 years prior to the date of the preliminary certificate. The Final Certificate of Title on ENG Form 1013, shall be executed by a qualified Corps of Engineers' attorney, preferably the same attorney who executed the preliminary certificate, and shall be based on a further search of the local land records from the date of the preliminary certificate to and including the date and time of recordation of the deed to the United States or to the date title passes in a condemnation proceeding. The attorney preparing such preliminary or final certificate of title shall also prepare an Abstract of Title evidencing the results of his search of the records. The Certificate of Title will set forth in detail all liens, encumbrances, outstanding interests and other estates adversely affecting the title.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Easements.</E> The standards and requirements as to title evidence for fee acquisition, set forth above, will be observed in the acquisition of all easements, except as follows:</P>

                  <P>(1) Preliminary certificates of title of approved title companies for easement acquisitions will be in the same form approved by the Attorney General for fee acquisitions and issued by the Chief of Engineers as ENG Form 903. Final certificates of title in easement acquisitions, however, must show title to the easement vested in the United States in the same land described in the certificate and the deed to the <PRTPAGE P="131"/>United States. A form of final certificate of title for easements approved by the Attorney General and issued by the Chief of Engineers as ENG Form 1017, Final Certificate of Title for Easements, will be used in easement acquisitions.</P>
                  <P>(2) In contracting for certificates of title to easements, ENG Form 1016, Specifications for Furnishing and Delivering Certificates of Title, Owner's Title Guarantee (Insurance) Policies and Continuations Thereof, may be used provided the following paragraph is substituted in the detailed specifications: “Each certificate of title shall be executed in triplicate on legal size paper. Preliminary certificates of title shall be in the form attached hereto, ENG Form 903, and final certificates of title for easements, showing title vested in the United States, shall be in the form attached hereto, ENG Form 1017.”</P>
                  <P>(3) In jurisdictions where it is not possible to obtain certificates of title commercially, title guarantee (insurance) policies may be obtained. In such cases, appropriate adjustment in forms and specifications will be made, comparable to those prescribed for certificates of title to easements above.</P>
                  <P>(4) For easements costing more than $100 but not in excess of $5,000, the requirements of the Attorney General have been waived. In such cases, it is acceptable to use certificates of title prepared and executed by a qualified Corps of Engineers' attorney. The Preliminary Certificate of Title, ENG Form 909, shall be based upon a search of the local land records beginning with a deed or other instrument transferring title recorded at least 25 years prior to the date of the preliminary certificate. The Final Certificate of Title on ENG Form 1013, shall be executed by a qualified Corps of Engineers' attorney, preferably the same attorney who executed the preliminary certificate, and shall be based on a further search of the local land records from the date of the preliminary certificate to and including the date and time of recordation of the deed to the United States or to the date title passes in a condemnation proceeding. The attorney preparing such preliminary or final certificate of title shall also prepare an Abstract of Title evidencing the results of his search of the records. The Certificate of Title will set forth in detail all liens, encumbrances, outstanding interests and other estates adversely affecting the title.</P>
                  <P>(5) As to easements which cost $100 or less, acquisition shall be in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) on page 5 of “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” (Department of Justice, 1970) which permit such acquisition to be based on a last owner search. Any search authorized by these provisions may be conducted by a qualified attorney employed by the Corps of Engineers.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Survey of area and source of title evidence.</E> Contemporaneously with the preparation of the real estate design memorandum, or real estate planning report, the Division or District Engineer is requested to:</P>
                  <P>(1) Give careful consideration to the problems involved to determine the most acceptable type of title evidence, its source, availability of title plants, costs, and time of procurement, so that the most advantageous bid(s) may be received and accepted and the acquisition schedule maintained. In considering costs of abstracts of title versus certificates of title or title insurance, the workhours involved in the examination of abstracts of title by both Corps and Department of Justice personnel should be considered.</P>
                  <P>(2) Determine the total number of tracks in the project area. In major projects, it may be desirable to invite bids for title evidence for each county or other specified areas, in addition to the entire project, in order to maintain the acquisition schedule.</P>
                  <P>(3) Determine the names and addresses of title companies and abstractors available to furnish title evidence and whether such companies or abstractors have been approved by the Attorney General as acceptable companies or abstractors. Current information on approved title companies and abstractors may be obtained direct from the Land and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, WASH DC 20530.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Selection procedure.</E> (1) Normally selection of persons or firms to perform <PRTPAGE P="132"/>title evidence services will be based upon formal advertising in accordance with the Armed Services Procurement Regulation (ASPR) (chapter I of this title).</P>
                  <P>(2) In those States where the furnishing of title evidence is held to constitute the practice of law and the State canons of legal ethics prohibit attorneys from engaging in competitive bidding for such services, contracts for title evidence services must necessarily be negotiated. In such cases, negotiations shall be conducted with attorneys or law firms duly authorized to practice law in the jurisdiction within which the real property is located. Division and District Engineers shall notify HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 before negotiating for title evidence, and submit the list of attorneys with whom negotiations may be conducted. Selections shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth below:</P>
                  <P>(i) A contract for title services shall be based upon, but not limited to, consideration of the following professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required:</P>
                  <P>(A) Professionally trained for type of work;</P>
                  <P>(B) Specialized experience in the type of work required;</P>
                  <P>(C) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;</P>
                  <P>(D) Past experience, if any, with respect to performance on Corps of Engineers contracts;</P>

                  <P>(E) Location in the general geographical area of the project to which the services relate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That there is an appropriate number of qualified attorneys or law firms therein for consideration; and</P>
                  <P>(F) Volume of work previously awarded, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of title evidence contracts among qualified attorneys and law firms.</P>
                  <P>(ii) A preselection list of qualified attorneys and law firms shall be prepared by a preselection board from data submitted by interested attorneys and law firms and from other pertinent information which may be available. The list shall be approved by the District Engineer or his designee.</P>
                  <P>(iii) A selection board shall review the qualifications of each of the attorneys or law firms on the preselection list, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and shall recommend to the District Engineer, in order of preference, a minimum of three for approval for contract negotiations.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Upon approval of the selections by the District Engineer and such approval as may be required by paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, negotiations shall be initiated with the first selected attorney or law firm. If the negotiations result in a price which exceeds the Government estimate, revised to correct errors of fact or judgment, if any, by more than ten percent, the Contracting Officer shall terminate the negotiations and request a proposal from the attorney or law firm next in order of preference.</P>
                  <P>(v) Preparation of preselection lists and selections for contracts estimated to cost more than $10,000, shall be accomplished by formally constituted boards consisting of at least three members, one of whom shall be the District Counsel or an attorney on his staff, and one of whom shall be the Chief, Real Estate Division, or a member of his staff.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Special approval shall be required for certain selections as indicated below:</P>
                  <P>(A) When the estimated cost of a contract to be negotiated exceeds $100,000, the selection shall require the approval of the Division Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(B) When an attorney or law firm, to which the District has awarded contracts totalling over $100,000 during the current fiscal year, has been selected by the District for additional negotiations, the selection shall require the approval of the Division Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(C) When the estimated cost of a contract to be negotiated exceeds $200,000, the selection shall require the approval of the Director of Real Estate, OCE, or his designee, with the concurrence of the Chief Counsel or his designee.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Forms to be used.</E> When purchasing title evidence, Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer, and Award, which form embraces an invitation, bid, and acceptance, should be used with copies of ENG Form 1012 or ENG Form 1016, <PRTPAGE P="133"/>depending upon the type of title evidence to be obtained. Standard Form 33 will state that time is of the essence; that ability to comply with delivery requirements is mandatory; that the specifications attached thereto constitute a part of the proposed contract; the quantity and description of the supplies by item to be furnished; the time, place, and method of delivery; and the primary period of contract and extensions. Bids must be submitted in the form required by the invitations for the bids, so that the successful bid can be accepted on Standard Form 33 and a formal contract consummated thereby. The contract must incorporate all the covenants, terms, and conditions which are contemplated.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Base price vs. per-item basis.</E> The invitation will call for the furnishing of an approximate number of certificates of title, abstracts of title, or preliminary binders and title guarantee (insurance) policies, as the case may be, at a stated price per certificate of title, abstract, or preliminary binder and title guarantee (insurance) policy. If this basis of payment is not possible, payment for abstracts may be made on a per-item or per-page basis and certificates of title and interim binders and title guarantee (insurance) policies may be paid for in accordance with an established rate schedule based on the cost of the property. Where necessary, alterations in the payment paragraphs of the specifications may be made in order to comply with local practices, State statutes, or other special requirements.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Specifications.</E> The specifications for title service will follow ENG Form 1012 for abstracts, ENG Form 1016 for certificates of title and ENG Form 1014 for interim binders on owner's title guarantee (insurance) policies. Additional provisions may be added as circumstances require, but basic requirements will not be changed.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Several contracts for title evidence.</E> To meet the acquisition schedule, it may be necessary to enter into several contracts for title evidence to lands within a designated project area. In such cases, the portions of the projects to be covered by each contract will be defined according to established political subdivisions, such as districts, townships, counties, or any specified part thereof.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of title evidence contracts.</E> The Contracting Officer, if an employee of the Real Estate Division, or otherwise the Real Estate representative designated by the Division or District Engineer, will review contracts for title evidence. If this review is made by a Real Estate employee other than a Contracting Officer, he will advise the Contracting Officer relative thereto. The Contracting Officer or the Real Estate representative will ascertain that the Department of Justice has approved the bidder, and the contract will not be awarded to any bidder not so approved. The Contracting Officer or the Real Estate representative who is to advise him, will familiarize himself with “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States,” issued by the Department of Justice, 1970.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Distribution.</E> Upon acceptance, copies of title evidence contracts will be distributed in the same manner as other contracts.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Ordering title evidence.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Placing orders.</E> Where the contract does not specify the order in which title evidence for particular tracts will be furnished, orders will be submitted to the abstractor or title company on ENG Form 1011, Order for Title Evidence. An accurate legal description of the tract of land involved will be attached to the order or will be typed thereon.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Orders based on contiguous areas.</E> If the contract does not contain a list of tracts for which title evidence is to be furnished, orders will be based on contiguous areas of land in identical ownership and will be deemed to be contiguous even though crossed by roads, railroads, rights-of-way, or streams. In such event the variation in quantity shall not exceed plus or minus ten percent as prescribed by ASPR. If there has been a severance of surface and subsurface estates, determination of <PRTPAGE P="134"/>what constitutes a tract will be based on ownership of the surface. However, in unusual cases where such a contiguous area is composed of several parcels derived through separate chains of title and requiring separate searches of each chain of title down to a comparatively recent date or where such contiguous area lies in more than one section, the Contracting Officer may contract to pay a specified reasonable additional charge for each such additional chain or section if such additional charge is customary in the locality where the land lies.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Type of title evidence.</E> The order will set forth the type of evidence to be furnished. When abstracts are contracted for, the following rules will be observed:</P>
                  <P>(1) If an abstract of title in satisfactory form cannot be procured from the landowner, a new abstract will be ordered.</P>
                  <P>(2) If an abstract in satisfactory form is procured from a landowner, the abstract will be transmitted to the abstractor with an order for a continuation of the old abstract.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Payment for title services.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval.</E> The Contracting Officer will approve payment for all title evidence obtained in connection with the acquisition of land from funds available to the Division or District Engineer for that purpose, whether the land is acquired by purchase or condemnation.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Review.</E> When abstracts are furnished on a per-item or per-page basis, the contents must be carefully reviewed by a qualified representative of the Division or District Engineer, to insure that bills are not excessive and that abstracts do not include superfluous material. Where erroneous or superfluous material is included in abstract, the bills involved will be corrected so that payment for such material is not made. All title evidence will be examined to determine that there has been full compliance with the specifications.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment for title evidence.</E> Payments for title evidence will be made by the Contracting Officer from available funds for the project to which the title evidence pertains, upon receipt of certified and approved vouchers.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Preparation of Invoices for Title Services.</E> The abstractor or title company will submit a certified invoice for services rendered, to the office to which the title evidence was delivered for review. The invoice must specify the particular type of title evidence furnished, the tract number, name of owner, name of project, and contract number. Invoices found to be correct will be certified as to receipt of the services by the receiving office and will be transmitted to the Division or District Engineer for further action and payment.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Approval of Title by the Attorney General.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Section 355 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as amended (40 U.S.C. 255), formerly required the written opinion of the Attorney General in favor of the validity of the title to lands as a prerequisite to the expenditure of public funds thereon.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Delegation.</E> Pursuant to the provisions of Pub. L. 91-393, approved September 1, 1970, authority to approve title to lands being acquired for the use of the Department of the Army, or of any other department or agency for which the Department of the Army is authorized to acquire land, has been delegated to the Department of the Army, subject to the supervision and review of the Attorney General. Generally, military authorization and/or appropriation legislation expressly authorizes construction on the land prior to approval of title.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Redelegation.</E> The authority delegated to the Department of the Army pursuant to Pub. L. 91-393 has been redelegated to Division and District Engineers with real estate responsibility.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Issuance of title opinions.</E> Division and District Engineers are authorized to designate staff attorneys to give written approval of the sufficiency of title to land for the purposes for which the property is being acquired. Such attorneys shall issue preliminary and/or final opinions of title.</P>

                  <P>(1) Attorneys designated for such purposes will have as a minimum five years legal experience, from the date of <PRTPAGE P="135"/>admission to a State bar, including three years experience in the law of real property. Real estate attorneys on the staffs of Division and District Engineers, who possess these qualifications, will be designated by the Division and District Engineers, in writing, to pass on the sufficiency of title to lands pursuant to the said delegation. The names of such attorneys shall be furnished to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 as soon as possible.</P>
                  <P>(2) A final opinion of title shall be issued in all acquisitions, except for easement acquisitions not in excess of $1,000 which are governed by § 644.69(b).</P>
                  <P>(3) Division and District Engineers are authorized to waive the issuance of written preliminary opinions of title where the closing of the case is based upon a certificate of title or title insurance issued by an acceptable and approved title company, in either fee or easement acquisitions.</P>
                  <P>(4) A preliminary and a final opinion of title shall be issued in all fee and easement acquisitions involving abstracts of title, except for easement acquisitions not in excess of $1,000 which are governed by § 644.69(b).</P>
                  <P>(5) Any final title opinion issued pursuant to the delegated authority shall substantially follow the format of the Attorney's Final Title Opinion (Figure 5-3 of ER 405-1-12).</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Opinion of Attorney General.</E> Whenever the District or Division Engineer determines that a title defect is of such character that a possibility exists that it may be waived, the case shall be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 for review and transmittal to the Attorney General for a title opinion. The letter of submittal shall contain or be accompanied by the information and data required by § 644.72(b).</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Rejection opinion.</E> If it is obvious that no possibility of waiver of a title defect exists, a title opinion shall be issued according to the procedure set forth in § 644.67(d). Copies of such opinion shall be submitted with the condemnation assembly.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Curative action.</E> Upon receipt of an acceptable certificate of title, ENG Form 903 or an interim binder on an owner's title guarantee or insurance policy, ENG Form 1014, the title evidence will be reviewed by a qualified real estate attorney of the Corps of Engineers. Where the title evidence indicates that the acquisition of the land or interest therein by purchase is feasible, and a satisfactory ENG Form 42, Offer to Sell Real Property, or ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, is received from the landowner and accepted by the Government, curative action will be conducted and curative material will be processed as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) With regard to the title objections set forth in Schedule “B” of certificates of title or interim binders, it will be necessary to take such curative action as will insure the issuance of a final certificate of title or title guarantee or insurance policy showing title vested in the United States of America, subject only to those objections, if any, which have been administratively waived.</P>
                  <P>(2) As set forth in the title contract, the title company will authorize its local representative to give final approval of curative material furnished to satisfy such objections and insure their elimination from the final certificate of title or title guarantee or insurance policy. As such curative material is approved, the local representative of the title company will:</P>
                  <P>(i) Initial, or otherwise indicate, on the margin of the preliminary certificate or interim binder, the fact that the objection has been eliminated through the procurement of satisfactory curative material.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Determine whether or not he wishes the curative instrument recorded and if the instrument is to be recorded, so indicate on the margin of the certificate or interim binder. By the express terms of the offer to sell, the vendor is responsible for payment of recording fees on such curative material.</P>

                  <P>(iii) Where curative material is not recorded, the title company will be permitted to retain such material if they wish it for their files; otherwise, it will be placed with the title assembly. If the original curative instruments are retained by the title company, true copies will be transmitted with the <PRTPAGE P="136"/>Final Title Assembly to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Intermediate certificates or interim binders.</E> In the following types of cases, it may be necessary, after examination of the preliminary certificates of title or interim binder, to obtain intermediate certificates of title or interim binders in order to perfect title prior to closing the transaction:</P>
                  <P>(1) When the signer of the offer is not the record title holder but is the holder of a contract for purchase, recorded or unrecorded, the preliminary certificate of title or interim binder will show title in the record title holder. In such cases, the certificate or binder will make appropriate reference to the contract. It will recite the action necessary to complete the contract and effect transfer of title from the record holder to the contract purchaser. When the deed to the contract purchaser is recorded, an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder, in proper form, will be obtained.</P>
                  <P>(2) In those cases in which record title is vested in a deceased person, the preliminary certificate of title or interim binder may be issued in the name of the deceased record owner, followed by the word “deceased,” and will be accompanied by a letter from the title company stating whether a judicial proceeding will be required, or whether affidavits of heirship, or other forms of proof, will suffice to permit the issuance of intermediate certificate or binder showing title vested in the heirs of the deceased.</P>
                  <P>(i) Where a judicial proceeding is required, action will immediately be taken by the owners to perfect title by such proceeding, and, upon completion, an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder should be obtained. If such action cannot be completed within 60 days, action will be taken to acquire the tract by condemnation, § 644.72(a).</P>
                  <P>(ii) Where a judicial proceeding is not required, it will be necessary to effect the necessary curative action and obtain an intermediate certificate or interim binder showing title in the heirs of the deceased record owners.</P>
                  <P>(3) In those cases in which conveyance to the United States is to be made by a fiduciary, a corporation, a political subdivision, or an unincorporated association, the certificate of title or interim binder will state whether the proposed grantor has legal authority to convey valid title to the United States, and, if so, will cite the source of the authority. If the preliminary certificate of title or interim binder does not so indicate, it will be returned to the title company for correction or for issuance of an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder.</P>
                  <P>(4) Where the certificate of title or interim binder contains any objection, or reference to liens of taxes, assessments, bonds, or other indebtedness of a road improvement, school, drainage, or other type of special improvement district, the specifications provide that the certificate or interim binder will also contain reference to the statute or statutes, under which the district was created, its bonds issued, and its taxes levied; the amount of taxes and assessments levied and bonds issued; and other additional pertinent information. If the preliminary certificate or interim binder does not contain sufficient information to enable an examining attorney to determine the nature and extent of the lien, if any, on the land, of such taxes, assessments and bonds, it will be returned to the title company for correction or for issuance of an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder. If the preliminary certificate or interim binder does not clearly indicate that the bonds or taxes of such district become a lien annually at the same time as the lien of ad valorem taxes attaches to land in the State and that the lien is of the same nature as the lien of ad valorem taxes, the information specified above must be obtained and a determination must be made as to the nature and extent of the liens of such bonds and taxes.</P>

                  <P>(5) Where the certificate of title or interim binder discloses a covenant or condition restricting the use of the land, the certificate or interim binder will set forth the restriction, will quote the provision imposing the restriction or creating the right of reverter for a breach thereof, and will state whether a release will eliminate the objection. If such information is not contained in the preliminary certificate of title or interim binder, it will be returned to <PRTPAGE P="137"/>the title company for correction or for issuance of an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder. If a release will eliminate the objection, action will be taken to obtain an appropriate release from the person or persons holding the right of reverter. Should the title company hold that the title cannot be perfected by a release or if an acceptable release cannot be obtained, action will be taken to acquire the tract by condemnation.</P>
                  <P>(6) When the specifications require the title company to include any of the above information in the preliminary certificate of title or interim binder and it is necessary to obtain an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder due to the omission of such information from the preliminary report by the title company, the intermediate certificate of title or interim binder will be furnished without cost to the United States.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Question of law.</E> Any difficult or complicated question of law raised by an objection or exception in a preliminary or intermediate certificate of title or interim binder should be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 for review and transmittal to the Attorney General for an opinion. The letter of submittal shall contain a full statement of the facts and references to the provisions of applicable statutes and pertinent decisions of state courts on the question involved. This action should be taken before closing. This action should also be taken on questions involving the nature and extent of the liens of bonded indebtedness, assessments, or taxes to meet the bonded indebtedness of special improvement districts, or relating to restrictive covenants.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Title Clearance—Easements.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Easements Costing in Excess of $1,000.</E> Curative action and clearance of title to easements costing in excess of $1,000 will be the same as in fee acquisitions, as outlined above, except as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) Under an agreement with the Department of Justice, title to easements will be approved subject to outstanding encumbrances, such as mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, and vendors' liens, where the tract is not encumbered in excess of 50 percent of the reasonable value of the remaining property, and the consideration being paid for the easement does not represent a sum in excess of ten percent of the value of the remaining property. (As to taxes, see § 644.70(k)(6).)</P>
                  <P>(2) For the purpose of making the determinations necessary to apply the formula set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, resort may be had to the tract appraisal, provided it is based on a “before and after” approach, in which case the amount of the “after” appraisal will be used as the reasonable value of the remaining property. In the event no such appraisal has been made, a memorandum estimate by a qualified appraiser (staff or contract) will be obtained. Determination of the total encumbrances may be made on the basis of the face of the encumbering instruments. However, if it is necessary to determine that the total amount of the outstanding liens as of the date of closing has been reduced to an amount less than 50 percent of the reasonable value of the remaining property, such reduction must be evidenced by signed statements from the lienees or their authorized representatives. The appraisal or memorandum estimate and the lienee statements will be placed in the tract file.</P>
                  <P>(3) On the basis of the determinations described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the appropriate information will be inserted on ENG Form 3536, Statement Concerning Outstanding Encumbrances, which will be signed by the closing agent. The original will appear as a separate document in the Final Title Assembly submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Easements Costing Not in Excess of $1,000.</E> (1) Requirements for the release or subordination to such easements of mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, vendors' liens, taxes which are a lien, whether or not presently due and payable, and similar encumbrances will ordinarily be the same as for easements costing in excess of $1,000.</P>

                  <P>(2) In unusual circumstances, these requirements need not be applied if the purchase price of the easement is insufficient to satisfy the liens and interest, or the amount of such liens or interest is small in comparision with the value <PRTPAGE P="138"/>of the land in which the easement is being acquired, and in comparison with the cost of condemnation proceedings to clear the title. In such cases, the Division or District Engineer (or the Chief, Real Estate Division, if delegated such authority) may waive such title infirmities as he determines will not interfere with the use of the easement by the Government or jeopardize the interests of the United States: <E T="03">Provided:</E>
                  </P>
                  <P>(i) The easement deed contains a general warranty covenant by the grantor to satisfy all such unpaid taxes and other liens and to warrant the title against any encumbrances or interests left outstanding.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The Division or District Engineer (or the Chief, Real Estate Division, if delegated the authority) has determined that such outstanding liens, encumbrances, or interest, if left outstanding, will not interfere with the Government's use of the easement, or will not jeopardize the interests of the United States, and in his opinion the title is sufficient. A certificate to this effect should be attached to the Final Title Assembly.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Curative action.</E> (1) Curative action will be initiated promptly in all cases to eliminate all title defects or encumbrances, except those which may be administratively waived, those which may be eliminated by the payment of money and cleared at the time of closing, and those which may be waived as hereinafter provided. Curative material need not be recorded, however, until the closing of the transaction.</P>
                  <P>(2) All encumbrances, defects, outstanding interests, and other matters shown in the preliminary certificates of title or interim binders, must be cured and eliminated before delivery of the purchase check, except those of a nature which have been waived as not interfering with the Government's use of the easement or as not jeopardizing the interest of the United States.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Closing and Settlement Officers.</E> Payment and closing of cases will be initiated immediately upon completion of curative action, by qualified Closing Officers employed by the Corps of Engineers. To be qualified, a Closing Officer must be employed in the Real Estate Division of a Division or District Office, or in a Real Estate Project or Suboffice, in an Attorney-Advisor position, or in a Realty Officer position if he is a member in good standing of the Bar of a State, Possession, or the District of Columbia, and has been instructed in Federal procedure and in the requirements for closing land acquisition transactions by a Division or District Closing Officer and has been approved by the Division or District Engineer to close land acquisition transactions independently. It is no longer necessary for Closing Officers to be individually bonded. Contracting for closing services will require prior approval of HQDA (DAEN-REA-P).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment.</E> Payment for land, or interests therein, will be made from funds available to the Division or District Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">General.</E> The details of the closing necessarily differ according to the number of vendors and the outstanding interests, the number and variety of the encumbrances and title objections to be met, and miscellaneous other details resulting from complications in the particular title. Upon receipt of the check and title papers, the Closing Officer will review the entire file relating to the acquisition, fully acquaint himself with the terms and conditions of the sale, and with the condition of the title, and will ascertain whether there are any special conditions to be performed, or requirements to be met, on the part of the landowner or the Government and what objections to the title are to be eliminated before valid title may vest in the United States.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Curative data.</E> The Closing Officer will determine the character and amount of all outstanding interests in, liens on, or claims against the land, which are to be satisfied out of the purchase price, and see that necessary curative action has been taken and curative data obtained to cure all defects in and meet all objections to the title. If the title evidence consists of a certificate of title of a title company, or a title guarantee policy, approval of the curative material, obtained to eliminate the title objections, must be obtained from the title company.<PRTPAGE P="139"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Continuation of title search.</E> The Closing Officer will satisfy himself that no change has occurred in the land records from the date of the prior certification which will adversely affect the title to the real estate interest being acquired by the United States. Where deemed appropriate because of the complexities of the title, the amount of the purchase price, or other reason, the local representative of the title company or the abstracter will be requested to examine the title records for the purpose of making this determination, and a continuation of the title evidence should be obtained, if considered necessary. Otherwise, the interim title search may be made by the Closing Officer.</P>
                  <P>(1) If no adverse change in the status of title has occurred since the date of the preliminary or the latest certification of the title by the abstracter or the title company, as the case may be, the Closing Officer will proceed to close the case.</P>
                  <P>(2) In case of change in ownership during the period, the Closing Officer will order a continuation of the abstract or an intermediate certificate of title or interim binder, as the case may be, and take such action as necessary to cure the title.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Payment and Closing Sheet.</E> ENG Form 1566, Payment and Closing Sheet and Receipt for United States Treasurer's Check, covering all charges to be eliminated by payment of money to be deducted from the purchase money check, will be prepared in advance of closing. This sheet will show, in detail, all disbursements of the purchase money, including all amounts to be expended for satisfaction of:</P>
                  <P>(1) Taxes and assessments.</P>
                  <P>(2) Outstanding judgments—State and Federal.</P>
                  <P>(3) Mortgages, deeds of trust, and other liens.</P>
                  <P>(4) Amounts received under any contract or bond.</P>
                  <P>(5) Landowner's balance after all charges are deducted from the purchase price.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Division or District inspection of premises.</E> The Closing Officer or other authorized Division or District employee will personally make an inspection of the premises to ascertain whether any person is occupying the property in whole or in part.</P>
                  <P>(1) The Closing Officer or an authorized Division or District employee will prepare ENG Form 798, Certificate of Inspection and Possession.</P>
                  <P>(2) If any person other than the vendor is found in possession, the Closing Officer will secure a disclaimer on ENG Form 1290, Disclaimer. The disclaimer will be modified to make allowance of any provision in the offer to sell permitting possession after closing.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Closing Officer or an authorized Division or District employee will check to determine that the buildings, improvements, and crops listed on the appraisal report are still on the land being conveyed. Where buildings, improvements, and crops have been reserved by the landowner, it will be determined that only the items reserved have been removed. Whenever possession of land is surrendered to the Government before the time of payment and closing, and immediate inspection and report ENG Form 1567, Report on Vacation of Property, will have been made. The Closing Officer may rely upon this report for the inspection required in the first part of this paragraph unless he is aware of circumstances which would make a supplemental inspection and report proper. If no such inspection and report have been made and possession has been surrendered to the Government, the inspection and report must be made at this time.</P>
                  <P>(4) The Closing Officer or an authorized Division or District employee will determine whether there have been repairs or improvements to or construction on the premises which might give rise to mechanics liens.</P>
                  <P>(5) The ENG Form 798 will be executed and placed with the title papers. If executed by an employee other than the Project Manager or Closing Officer, it must be approved by the Project Manager or Closing Officer, to indicate that the Project Manager or Closing Officer has authorized the employee signing the certificate to make the inspection and is satisfied it has been properly done.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Deed to the United States.</E> (1) The deed to the United States will be drafted in accordance with the “Standards <PRTPAGE P="140"/>for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisition by the United States,” issued by the Department of Justice in 1970.</P>
                  <P>(2) Where the landowner's name appears in various forms among the title papers, full use will be made of the “also known as” clause in identifying the grantor in the deed to the United States.</P>
                  <P>(3) The deed shall contain a quitclaim clause by which the grantor quitclaims to the United States all right, title, and interest which the grantor may have in the banks, beds, and waters of any streams bordering the said land to be conveyed, and also all interest in alleys, roads, streets, ways, strips, gores, or railroad rights-of-way abutting or adjoining said land and in any means of ingress or egress appurtenant thereto.</P>
                  <P>(4) Recording fees, transfer taxes, and similar expenses incidental to conveying real property to the United States; penalty costs for prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage entered into in good faith encumbering such real property; and the pro rata portion of real property taxes paid which are allocable to a period subsequent to the date of vesting title in the United States, or the effective date of possession of such real property by the United States, whichever is the earlier, shall be paid by the Government pursuant to authority of section 303, Pub. L. 91-646, approved January 2, 1971.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Satisfaction of liens and encumbrances.</E> All mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, mechanics liens, and similar encumbrances will be satisfied and released or discharged of record. In the acquisition of easements, liens and encumbrances should be satisfied, released or subordinated to the Government's easement, except as provided in § 644.69(a) or unless administratively waived under § 644.69(c).</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Payments to tenants and lessees.</E> Amounts due lessees, or other tenants, under ENG Form 1564, Consent to Offer to Sell, will be paid from the purchase price or by the landowner direct. In either case, proper receipts and releases will be obtained.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Satisfaction and release of liens of taxes and assessments.</E> (1) Except as provided in § 644.69(b) and paragraph (k)(6) of this section, all taxes and assessments which, under the law of the State where the land is located, are a lien on the property as of the date of the delivery and recordation of the deed to the United States must be paid at or before closing, unless provision for their payment is made as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) Where closing takes place before the completion of the assessment and levy of the taxes necessary to the determination of the amount of the taxes, or before the taxes are due and payable, a sufficient sum will be withheld from the purchase price to satisfy such taxes when the amount is later determined or they later become due and payable. In cases where the amount of taxes has not been determined, an estimate will be made, after consultation with the assessor and consideration of the amount of taxes paid on the land for the preceding year. The amount withheld should be at least 20 percent in excess of the amount of taxes assessed against the property for the preceding year.</P>
                  <P>(ii) If the taxes are not due and payable under State law, though the amount has been determined at the time of closing, payment will not be made to the collector or other official charged with the collection of taxes, unless he has authority to accept payment and receipt for them in advance of the due date.</P>

                  <P>(2) Funds withheld for the payment of taxes will be transmitted promptly to the Division or District Engineer in the form of cashier's check or money order payable to the Treasurer of the United States, unless the taxes are paid or held in escrow by the title company. The Closing Officer, in transmitting such payments, must clearly identify, by name, the vendor from whom the tax money was withheld, and must identify the land for which the taxes were withheld by its tract number in the project. He must also identify the taxes for payment of which the money has been withheld by specifying the type of taxes, such as county, city, or school. He will set forth the year each became or becomes due and fully explain the manner in which payment or withholding has been handled in order that proper payment will be effected by the Division or District Engineer when <PRTPAGE P="141"/>the taxes are due and payable. Any balance of the amount withheld and not needed to satisfy the taxes will be refunded to the grantor.</P>
                  <P>(3) Where payment of the taxes is not possible at the time of closing and funds are withheld for this purpose, the Closing Officer will immediately notify the local tax official that title to the particular tract has been conveyed to the United States and that funds have been withheld for the payment of taxes, specifying the taxes for which an amount has been withheld and stating that such funds are in the custody of the Division or District Engineer. In giving such notice, he will use ENG Form 894, Notice to Tax Official.</P>
                  <P>(4) When the taxes become due and payable, the Division or District Engineer will pay such taxes from the funds withheld from the purchase price. Any excess between the amount of taxes actually paid and the amount withheld will be refunded to the grantor by the Division or District Engineer. Refund checks will be transmitted to the grantor only after it has been definitely determined that all taxes which were liens on the tract are shown as satisfied on the books of the tax collector. This is necessary to avoid the possibility of a refund being made before satisfaction of all tax liens. The tax receipt should be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REP-S) WASH DC 20314 for filing with the original title papers.</P>
                  <P>(5) Where the evidence of title consists of certificates of title or title insurance, and funds are withheld for payment of taxes, the amount so withheld may be turned over to the title company, provided:</P>

                  <P>(i) The title company is financially responsible and will agree to issue a final certificate of title or title policy in which no tax liens or unpaid taxes will be noted or, if noted, will be followed by the statement:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>For the payment of which provision has been made by deposit of a sufficient sum with this company.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <P>(ii) The title company will enter into an escrow agreement with the grantor to hold such sum for the satisfaction of the taxes when they become due, and to return to the grantor any excess remaining after their payment.</P>
                  <P>(6) Agreements have been reached with the Department of Justice that, in the acquisition of easements, the following will apply:</P>
                  <P>(i) No provision need be made for the payment of taxes which are a lien but are not due and payable, provided that the purchase price of the easement, including severance damage, is not in excess of 50 percent of the reasonable value of the entire contiguous property of the vendor. In the event the value of the easement has been determined by a “before and after” appraisal, the amount of the “after” appraisal will be utilized in making the necessary determination. In the event no such appraisal has been made, it will not be necessary to prepare a complete appraisal of the value of the contiguous property. In lieu thereof, a memorandum estimate by a qualified appraiser (staff or contract) will be obtained and placed in the tract file. In either case, the appropriate information will be inserted on ENG Form 3536, Statement Concerning Outstanding Encumbrances.</P>
                  <P>(ii) It will not be necessary to withhold funds for payment of current taxes which are due and payable, if the purchase price of the easement is insufficient to pay such taxes. In such case, Item 4 of ENG Form 3536 and the third block of that form will be completed.</P>
                  <P>(iii) ENG Form 3536 will be signed by the Closing Officer and the original will appear as a separate document in the Final Title Assembly.</P>
                  <P>(l) <E T="03">Payment and Recordation of Deed.</E> (1) No disbursement of the purchase price shall be made until:</P>
                  <P>(i) A duly executed deed has been accepted;</P>
                  <P>(ii) All outstanding charges, liens, or encumbrances on the land have been satisfied and discharged, or a sufficient sum has been withheld from the purchase price to satisfy and discharge such charges, liens and encumbrances; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) The title is sufficient for the purposes for which it is being acquired, and all objections thereto have been eliminated or administratively waived in writing.</P>

                  <P>(2) When the requirements of paragraph (l)(i) of this section have been satisfied, the balance of the purchase <PRTPAGE P="142"/>price shall be delivered to the landowners.</P>
                  <P>(3) The deed and all instruments which release liens or encumbrances on the property shall be promptly recorded.</P>
                  <P>(m) <E T="03">Closing of easements acquisitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Easement costing in excess of $1,000.</E> Closing requirements and procedures with respect to easements costing in excess of $1,000 are the same as in fee acquisitions, except as to mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, vendors' liens, and similar title infirmities (§ 644.69(a)), and as to taxes which are liens but which are not due and payable (paragraph (k)(6) of this section).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Easements costing not in excess of $1,000.</E> Closing requirements and procedures with respect to easements costing not in excess of $1,000 are the same as a fee acquisition except that title infirmities may be waived as provided in § 644.69(b).</P>
                  <P>(n) <E T="03">Payment and closing under power of attorney.</E> Where the landowner is unable or unwilling to be present personally or to pay from his own funds the amount necessary to satisfy all encumbrances and expenses, the following steps may be taken:</P>
                  <P>(1) Obtain a power of attorney from the landowner. Standard Form 232, Power of Attorney by Individual for the Collection of a Specified Check Drawn on the United States Treasury, will be used. If the landowner is a corporation, Standard Form 236, Power of Attorney by a Corporation for the Collection of a Specified Check Drawn on the Treasurer of the United States, and Standard Form 237, Resolution by Corporation Conferring Authority Upon an Officer to Execute a Power of Attorney for the Collection of Checks Drawn on the Treasurer of the United States, will be used. The power of attorney will be drawn in favor of the Closing Officer making the payment and closing. Immediately after the post office address of the Closing Officer, the following will be inserted, “Agent for the Disbursing Officer.” This insertion must be initialed by the person(s) executing the power of attorney. (Above forms are available through the local GSA Regional Office.)</P>
                  <P>(2) Obtain from the landowner ENG Form 1569, Order to Disburse Under Power of Attorney. It will be noted that this form specifically recites types of indebtedness or expense, the names of the persons to be paid under the power of attorney, and the estimated, but not necessarily the exact, amounts thereof. It is important that all items (including cost of revenue stamps, recordation fees for curative material, and bank service charges) be itemized on the form.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Closing Officer then will take the necessary action for and on behalf of the landowner to discharge the indebtedness and pay expenses under the ENG Form 1569.</P>
                  <P>(4) If it is possible to have all interested parties, other than the landowner, present at one time and to make all payments simultaneously, a round table closing will be conducted. The Closing Officer, under the power of attorney and order to disburse, will endorse and cash the Treasurer's check and will make the individual disbursements in actual cash.</P>
                  <P>(5) If it is possible to determine definitely all items of payment simultaneously, but it is not possible to have all interested parties present at one time, the Closing Officer will, under the power of attorney and order to disburse, endorse and cash the Treasurer's check, obtain separate cashier's checks for all items of payment (including the bank services charge for the issuance of such checks), and deliver the checks.</P>
                  <P>(6) Where it is not possible to determine definitely all items of payment simultaneously, the Closing Officer, under power of attorney and order to disburse, will endorse and cash the Treasurer's check and will obtain separate cashier's checks for all items of payment for which disbursements may be properly made and for any balance representing the total of any items, the amounts of which cannot be definitely determined; in other words, for the residue of the amount of the United States Treasurer's check. In every instance, the cashier's checks will be drawn to provide for endorsement by the Closing Officer or landowner as later determined to be appropriate.</P>

                  <P>(7) Curative material which requires recordation will be recorded for and on behalf of the landowner and will then be placed with the title papers.<PRTPAGE P="143"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(8) The usual tax receipts, mortgage releases, judgment satisfactions, etc., will be obtained for each monetary encumbrance which has been discharged. These instruments will be placed with the title papers, unless the landowner wishes to retain them.</P>
                  <P>(9) Separate receipts on ENG Form 1571, Receipt for Payment Under Power of Attorney, must be obtained for each disbursement made under the power of attorney and order to disburse, including a receipt for the balance of the purchase price paid to the landowner. One copy of such receipt will be placed in the project files.</P>
                  <P>(10) The Closing Officer will prepare an original and two copies of ENG Form 1570, Report of Disbursement Under Power of Attorney, showing the exact amount of each disbursement made under the power of attorney and order to disburse. The Closing Officer will prepare an original and two copies of appropriate certification thereon. The original and two copies will be signed by the landowner, who will retain one copy. The Closing Officer will place one copy in the files of the project office and will place the original with the title papers. The separate receipts on ENG Form 1571 for each disbursement made will be attached to the original ENG Form 1570.</P>
                  <P>(o) <E T="03">Procurement of check.</E> (1) After acceptance and distribution of the offer assembly and the acquisition is ready for closing, the following instruments and supporting data will be transmitted to the Finance and Accounting Officer for scheduling of SF 1166, Voucher and Schedule of Payments, and issuance of check:</P>
                  <P>(i) Two true copies of the preliminary opinion of the Attorney General, where required; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) Two true copies of a preliminary certificate of title or title guarantee policy where the preliminary opinion of the Attorney General is not required; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) Two copies of ENG Form 909, Attorney's Preliminary Certificate of Title, in easements acquisition which cost less than $1,000; and</P>
                  <P>(iv) Two true copies of other supporting data evidencing amount due and payable, such as statement of closing attorney; and</P>
                  <P>(v) Two true copies of the offer assembly or deed executed by the vendor, if offer form has not been utilized.</P>

                  <P>(2) The following statement, appropriately modified, signed by the Chief, Real Estate Division, may be transmitted in lieu of the above listed certificates:

                    <P>I certify that the check requested hereby is to pay an obligation of the United States as reflected on the attached (Offer to Sell) (easement or deed). I further certify that the parties signatory to this document and shown on the voucher as payees are the same parties reflected in a preliminary certificate of title issued by the _____ Title Company in the possession of the Real Estate Division of this office. The completion of the transaction will be in accordance with existing regulations pertaining to the closing of real estate acquisitions.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <FP>The landowner's signature on a voucher is not necessary. On payments involving civil funds, paragraph 3-7g, ER 37-2-10, will be followed.</FP>
                  <P>(p) <E T="03">Procedure after payment.</E> When the above closing requirements have been met, the Closing Officer will:</P>
                  <P>(1) Immediately order a final continuation of the type of title evidence which has been contracted for. The final title evidence must be dated as of the date of recordation of the deed to the United States, or a subsequent date, to show a valid title vested in the United States of America subject only to those title defects which have been administratively waived or to those liens and encumbrances for which sufficient funds were withheld from the purchase price to satisfy and discharge them.</P>
                  <P>(2) Check carefully ENG Form 1566, Payment and Closing Sheet and Receipt for United States Treasurer's Check, to see that funds have been properly disbursed.</P>
                  <P>(3) Review the continued abstract, final certificate of title, or title insurance policy, as soon as they are prepared and determine that the proper preliminary and final title evidence and related papers on the case have been completed in proper order. Thereupon a Final Title Opinion will be prepared.</P>

                  <P>Sections 644.81 through 644.88 describe the procedures of the Corps of Engineers relating to the acquisition of land and interests therein for both military and civil works projects by purchase, donation and transfer.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> These sections are applicable to all Division and District Engineers having real estate responsibilities.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Acquisition authority</E>—(1) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> Acquisition of land for use by the United States requires express authorization (10 U.S.C. 2676, 41 U.S.C. 14).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Military.</E> Title 10 U.S.C. 2571 authorizes transfer of real property between Defense elements without compensation if the Secretaries approve. Title 10 U.S.C. 2662 provides that acquisition of fee title or transfer of real <PRTPAGE P="145"/>property owned by the United States to another Federal agency, military department or a state must be reported to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives if the estimated value is more than $50,000 and the transaction may not be consummated until after 30 days have expired from the date the report is submitted to the Committees. Title 10 U.S.C. 2663 provides for acquisition by the Secretary of a military department during time of war or when war is imminent of any interest in land, including temporary use, required for a Defense installation, munitions plant or power plant for production of munitions, through negotiation and purchase, by condemnation or by gift. Title 10 U.S.C. 2672 provides that the Secretary of a military department may acquire any interest in land, including temporary use, by gift, purchase, exchange of United States owned land or otherwise, that he or his designee determines is needed in the interest of national defense and does not cost more than $50,000 exclusive of administrative costs or the amounts of deficiency judgments.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Civil works.</E> Acquisition of real property for civil works projects for which provision has been made by law is authorized in 33 U.S.C. 591-595a and 701. As in the case of military projects, the Secretary of the Army is also authorized to accept donations of lands and materials required for civil works projects.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Rights-of-entry.</E> Rights-of-entry for construction may be obtained by the Division or District Engineer, after he has been authorized by the Chief of Engineers to acquire the land, pending completion of acquisition by purchase or the filing of condemnation proceedings with declaration of taking. In the event the landowner will not voluntarily grant a right-of-entry, an appraisal of the required interest should be made and negotiations conducted on the basis thereof. If the negotiations are not successful, a declaration of taking should be submitted to acquire the necessary rights. The same procedure will be used for acquiring rights-of-entry for other purposes, such as survey and exploration.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Prerequisites to acquisition.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority to begin acquisition.</E> Action to acquire a tract of land will not be initiated until the Real Estate Design Memorandum (for all projects except military) or Real Estate Planning Report (for Army, other than Civil Works, and Air Force projects) is approved and specific authorization of the Chief of Engineers, or the appropriate Air Force Regional Civil Engineer (AFRCE), to proceed with the acquisition of the project is received by the Division and District Engineer and funds have been made available. Upon such approval, the Division or District Engineer is authorized to initiate action for the acquisition of the estate approved for the particular project in accordance with the procedures hereinafter set forth.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Tract description.</E> Authority to initiate engineering planning of a project will state the mapping procedures provided for in Chapter 3, ER 405-1-12. It is necessary that land requirements be determined, that the various tracts be identified by ownership, and that accurate tract descriptions be developed. Tract ownership data may be developed by Division or District personnel from the local land records or procured by contract from a qualified local Government official, abstractor or title company representative.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Title evidence.</E> With approval to proceed with acquisition, title evidence contracts can be initiated. The procedures for obtaining title evidence are covered in §§ 644.61 through 644.72. Preliminary title evidence to confirm ownership and status of the title is prerequisite to negotiating for acquisition of the land or interests therein.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Appraisals.</E> Concurrently with the procurement of title evidence, the appraisal of the land should begin. The appraisal, when approved, forms the basis for the determination of fair market value which will not be less than the approved appraised value. The appraisal procedures are covered in subpart B. Normally, one appraisal per tract (ownership) will be obtained; however, in unusual cases such as those which involve novel, unique or controversial appraisal concepts, there is no objection to obtaining more than one appraisal covering the same tract <PRTPAGE P="146"/>if considered advisable by the Division or District Engineer. When fee tracts are acquired by eminent domain procedures, where the value of the property is between $50,000 and $100,000, only one appraisal need be provided to the Department of Justice so long as it is a contract appraisal; two appraisals will be provided for values exceeding $100,000. Easement tracts acquired by eminent domain procedures, in excess of $50,000, will require two appraisals. At least one of the two appraisals must be made by a contract appraiser. Generally, in these cases, the second appraisal is procured only after negotiations indicate that agreement on price cannot be reached and that acquisition by condemnation will be required. The second appraisal will be procured in order that the Corps can take advantage of any negotiating flexibility that the second appraisal may afford in order to preclude court action. It is also necessary that the appraisals be relatively current in point of time (not to exceed six months) since dependent upon the real estate activity and degree of stability of the local economy, significant changes may take place in relatively short periods of time.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Environmental considerations.</E> Paragraph D3, Attachment 1 to Enclosure 1, DOD Directive 6050.1, dated March 19, 1974, subject: “Environmental Considerations in DOD Actions,” requires close environmental scrutiny of real estate acquisitions, disposals and outgrants to determine if said actions constitute a “Major Action Significantly Affecting the Quality of the Human Environment (MASAQHE).” If the action is determined to be a MASAQHE, then an environmental impact statement is required. Paragraph D3 is quoted here for ready reference:

                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>D. Certain types of actions require close environmental scrutiny because of the possibility that they may either affect the quality of the environment or create environmental controversy. It may be desirable in such cases to have a complete presentation of the environmental aspects of the proposed action available for any interested party. For these reasons, consideration shall be given to documenting the environmental effect of the following types of actions in writing: (The written environmental assessment need not be elaborate for actions in which it is readily determinable that the impact would not be significant; however, negative declarations must be supported by written environmental assessments which generally meet the EIS format requirements.)<STARS/>

                  <SUBJECT>Negotiations.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition objectives.</E> The objective of a land acquisition program is to acquire land at a price that will afford each landowner his constitutional guarantee of “just compensation” as that term has been defined by Federal judicial decisions. The Government must never pay less than just compensation unless a gift is intended. In eminent domain proceedings, the just compensation due a landowner is determined judicially by court award or by settlement prior to trial; in a purchase case, it is determined by negotiations leading to a satisfactory price and agreement with the landowner. While it is recognized that an appraisal is only an informed opinion and does not establish or determine just compensation, it is also recognized that, in negotiating for the purchase of land, an appraisal is the best and sometimes the only reliable opinion of the market value of the land which is supported by a thorough, acceptable analysis of market conditions at the time of purchase. Therefore, in the negotiation for the purchase of land, an approved current appraisal shall establish the minimum price to be paid for the land being acquired by the Corps of Engineers. Negotiations or offers below this price are prohibited except where the property is being acquired on a competitive basis and condemnation is not authorized.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Negotiating objectives.</E> In all cases, it is important that the negotiator receives adequate guidelines and explicit instructions. Promptly, after the amount of the estimated just compensation is established, the negotiator shall make an initial offer in the full amount of the fair market value, shall advise the landowner that the land was appraised for such amount, and shall furnish the landowner a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, <PRTPAGE P="147"/>said amount. A concentrated effort will be made to acquire the land for that amount. This written statement will be in the form of a letter which may be delivered personally or by first class mail. Such summary will include, as a minimum, the following items:</P>
                  <P>(1) Definition of the term “fair market value.”</P>
                  <P>(2) An accurate legal description and location identification of the real property and the interest(s) therein to be acquired (legal description and estate may be attached).</P>
                  <P>(3) The amount of the offer and a statement that such amount:</P>
                  <P>(i) Is the amount believed by the agency to be just compensation for the property;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Is not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Disregards any increase or decrease in the fair market value caused by the project for which the property is to be acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for such project, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner;</P>
                  <P>(iv) Does not reflect any consideration of or allowance for any relocation assistance and payments which the owner is entitled to receive.</P>
                  <P>(4) An inventory identifying the buildings, structures, fixtures, and other improvements, including appurtenant removable building equipment, which are considered to be part of the real property for which the offer of just compensation is made. The inventory shall include a statement of the utility and condition of said buildings, structures, fixtures, and other improvements.</P>

                  <P>(5) A description of the appraisal technique used, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, market approach, income approach, or cost approach, in sufficient detail to explain clearly to the landowner the process by which his property was valued. Thus, as an illustration, where the market approach was used, the explanation should include the number of comparable sales used, their general location and type, the factors considered in adjusting sales of subject property, and any other information which would help the landowner understand what was done to value his property. A statement that comparable sales of similar properties were examined without more explanation is not sufficient. Similar information should be given when any other appraisal technique is used. Unusual cases will require a more detailed explanation.</P>
                  <P>(6) An identification of land classification categories (do not show acreage breakdown).</P>
                  <P>(7) If only a portion of a property is to be acquired, an apportionment of the total estimated just compansation for the partial acquisition between:</P>
                  <P>(i) The amount representing the just compensation for the real property to be acquired;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The amount, if any, representing severance damages to the remainder, together with a brief narrative description of the cause thereof; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) In the event “off-setting benefits” are involved, these must be shown, along with a narrative explanation and the landowner shall be given a “person-to-person” explanation by the negotiator.</P>
                  <P>(8) If the property contain a dwelling, the value of said dwelling and homesite shall be set forth separately, with the statement that this figure will be used in calculating housing relocation benefits under title II of Pub. L. 91-646.</P>
                  <P>(9) If any building, structure, fixture, or other improvement, comprising part of the real property, has been identified as being owned by a tenant who has the right or obligation to remove it at the expiration of his term, the amount of the value of such building, structure, fixture, or other improvement, being the greater of:</P>
                  <P>(i) The amount which the tenant's improvement contributes to the fair market value of the real property to be acquired; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) The fair market value of the tenant's improvement for removal from the real property. The basis of such amount shall be included.</P>

                  <P>(c) Appraisal reports or the appraiser's analysis (complete breakdown of principal value elements) will not be revealed by the negotiator unless specifically authorized. Cases involving property for which the highest and best use cannot be definitely established, and to which the exceptions mentioned <PRTPAGE P="148"/>in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply, will be reported to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for specific instructions. If the land is being donated, initial offers are not necessary, and the appraisal will be significant in negotiations only when considering the conditions under which the donation is made as, for example, an agreed valuation for tax purposes. Negotiations will be based on current market values, which normally means that last offers will be based on appraisals not over six months old. Exceptions will be required in instances of rapid escalation of values when the appraisal is quickly outdated or in instances of a relatively static market or other condition resulting in a minimal change in property values. In such cases an explanation will be necessary.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Corps Employees.</E> If an employee of the Corps of Engineers has a direct interest in a tract of land being acquired by the Corps for public use, the tract will be acquired by condemnation. In cases of this nature, appraisal reports should be prepared, reviewed and forwarded together with a declaration of taking, with the condemnation assembly. The negotiator's report, of course, will not be included. The Department of Justice will be requested to handle all further matters pertaining to settlement or trial of the case. The Department of Justice has agreed to accept full responsibility for negotiations and approval of settlements or awards in such cases, without contacting any Corps personnel other than the owner of the interests being acquired.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Members of Congress.</E> Since, under 18 U.S.C. 431 and 432, members of Congress who hold interests in land that is required for project purposes cannot contract for sale of such interests to the Government, these interests will also be acquired by condemnation. Negotiations for acquisition by purchase or for settlement without trial cannot be conducted by officers or agents of the United States. The determination of just compensation must be made by judicial proceedings. Appraisal reports and the condemnation assembly should be prepared and forwarded as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Negotiating guidelines.</E> (1) The negotiator should be thoroughly familiar with the Division and District negotiating guidelines and should study the background data of the project, consisting of the authorizing act, survey report, project document, design memoranda, etc.; the applicable appraisal reports; tract ownership data; preliminary title certificates; and other related material. He should be entirely familiar with the project and the owner's individual property before initiating negotiations.</P>
                  <P>(2) The owner shall be provided with available brochures which explain the project and the Pub. L. 91-646 benefits, together with the written statement and summary required by § 644.83(b). The negotiator should explain to the landowner the Government's requirement for the land, the amount of land required, the estate(s) to be acquired, the terms and conditions of the Government's contract form, and the fact that relocation assistance benefits may be available. He should furnish the landowner a copy of a map indicating the boundaries of that portion of his land to be acquired, where the entire ownership is not being acquired or where different estates are being acquired in the same ownership, specifying the estate in each area.</P>
                  <P>(3) Negotiations will be continued in an effort to obtain acceptance of the Government's offer or a reasonable counteroffer from the landowner, or until it is definitely determined that such a counteroffer will not be forthcoming. It is not intended that negotiations be continued until an unacceptable counteroffer is finally obtained. However, in an effort to obtain a reasonable counteroffer above the Government's estimate, the negotiator will, if necessary, take the initiative in suggesting a series of prices within a range which, in accord with the guidelines discussed in § 644.84, has been predetermined to be reasonable.</P>

                  <P>(4) The interest of both owners and tenants must be considered and protected. The tenant is a proper party to the transaction, and every effort must be made to obtain the consent of the landowner and tenant as to the price to be paid to the tenant for his leasehold interest. This can be accomplished by <PRTPAGE P="149"/>the tenant's execution of ENG Form 1564, Consent to Offer to Sell Real Property, which shall then accompany the owner's offer to sell. In cases where the tenant executes this form, payment for the tenant's interest can be made to him in the closing of the purchase transaction. This procedure will be followed whenever possible. An exception is permitted in those cases where the landowner and tenant prefer to handle the matter as a private transaction between themselves. In such cases, it should be determined that a satisfactory agreement has been made by the landowner and tenant. Consideration should be given to any interest which the tenant may have in growing crops. This procedure is also applicable to any third party having an interest in the property, except through severance of a subsurface estate.</P>
                  <P>(5) Negotiations with landowners will be conducted in a fair and courteous manner. The negotiator must not, under any circumstances, resort to coercion or threats of condemnation.</P>
                  <P>(6) The negotiator has no authority to obligate the Government in any manner beyond the contract form. He must refrain from oral promises or understandings and include all terms and conditions in the contract form.</P>
                  <P>(7) Although appraisal reports cannot be made available for inspection by a landowner, the various elements of value considered by the appraisers may, and should, be discussed with the landowner to satisfy him that all elements of compensable values and damages have been considered in arriving at an overall value for the property being acquired. Care will be exercised during any discussion not to reveal specific amounts related to any elements considered in the appraisal, except the acquisition cost assigned to the dwelling for purpose of calculating replacement housing payment under section 203, Pub. L. 91-646.</P>
                  <P>(8) Any interest in a tract of land sought to be acquired, or any type of relationship with the owner, disqualifies the negotiator from participating in negotiations for the acquisition of that particular tract.</P>
                  <P>(9) An appraiser is not, under any circumstances, permitted to negotiate for the acquisition of a tract of land for which he has prepared the appraisal or reviewed it as reviewing appraiser.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Discussions With Landowners.</E> In order to avoid the creation of negotiating patterns, and keeping in mind that counteroffers must be justified as being just and reasonable, discussions with landowners should be conducted without disclosing the extent of the delegations and redelegations of authority to accept counteroffers. However, during negotiations on individual tracts, the landowners must be advised that, in the event of condemnation, the deposit will be in an amount no less than the approved appraised value, since the question of value cannot be resolved by negotiations. It must further be made clear that this advice is not in the nature of a threat, but is an explanation of the statement of policy directed by the Congress and the law. The negotiator will also inform each owner that offers and counteroffers made during negotiations are made without prejudice in the event of condemnation. The negotiator will make a notation on the Negotiator's Report to the effect that he has so informed the owner.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Obtaining the written counteroffer; preparation of negotiator's report.</E> If the negotiator considers that a counteroffer in excess of the approved appraised value is in the amount which should be considered for acceptance, the counteroffer will be reduced to writing on ENG Form 42, Offer to Sell Real Property, or on ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, and be properly executed by the landowner. In such cases, a complete written record of negotiations with respect to each tract or ownership, as appropriate, will be maintained by means of ENG Form 3423, Negotiator's Report, Part I. This record will state the chronological history of negotiations, all elements considered in evaluating the landowner's final counteroffer, and the justification for such recommendation in accordance with § 644.84. The justification will be fully recorded in ENG Form 3423A, Negotiator's Report, Part II, which is a separate page of this report, and which will be removed in the Office of the Chief of Engineers prior to submitting the counteroffer assembly to higher authority for approval. Final action on <PRTPAGE P="150"/>the counteroffer, either by the Secretary of the Army, the Chief of Engineers or under the delegated authority to Division and District Engineers, will be entered on this record as soon as that information is available.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 644.84</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Counteroffers.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Consideration of counteroffers.</E> In negotiations with landowners, if agreement cannot be reached with a landowner as to the purchase price established by the appraisal, the lowest price demanded by the landowner may be considered by the Division and District Engineer, and the Chief of the Real Estate Division, on the basis of the following factors:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Variations in appraisals.</E> In the usual case, the Corps will have the opinion of only one appraiser with respect to the market value of the particular tract of land. It must be recognized that the opinion of a second equally competent appraiser might be higher or lower than that of the appraiser who appraised the property. Hence in considering counteroffers of landowners, Division and District Engineers should keep in mind that two equally competent appraisals may reflect reasonably divergent opinions of value as to the same property. Instances requiring two appraisals are covered in § 644.82(d).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Built-in costs, prior counteroffers, settlements and liability risks of proceeding to trial.</E> It is recognized that there are certain Government administrative costs and liability risks involved when property is condemned by the United States and the land value is judicially determined. These items are definite in character but the attendant costs will vary. “Built-in” costs of proceeding to trial include, but are not limited to, the following items: Salaries of all Government personnel participating in trial preparation, pre-trial hearings, and the actual trial; cost of an additional appraisal(s); witness fees of contract appraisers employed by the Corps of Engineers or the Department of Justice; travel costs of all Government personnel and consultants participating in trial preparation, pre-trial hearings, and the actual trial; and cost of preparing trial documents and exhibits. Consideration should also be given to prior counteroffers which have been accepted and settlements approved prior to trial. “Liability risks” of proceeding to trial are the amount of the anticipated award over and above the appraised value, taking into consideration probable testimony on behalf of the Government and the landowners, as well as the history of condemnation awards in the Federal court jurisdiction in which the lands are located, and the amount of interest on a deficiency judgment which would result from the anticipated award. Serious consideration of the above factors may justify a recommendation for authority to accept a counteroffer which otherwise would appear to liberal.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-compensable elements of value.</E> Elements of value based on consequential damages or speculative values, as defined by the Federal courts, may not be recognized in considering a landowner's counteroffer. However, even though a landowner's counteroffer might include non-compensable items of value, favorable consideration of the counteroffer may be given if it can be justified on the basis of variances in appraisals, built-in costs, and liability risks of proceeding to trial.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Value of reserved items.</E> The salvage value of improvements and the value of crops and/or timber reserved by the landowners, as provided in § 644.86 (g), (h), and (i), will not be included in the amount of the counteroffer in determining the excess of counteroffers over appraised values when applying the dollar and percentage limitations in the delegations of authority to Division and District Engineers for acceptance of counteroffers. The determination of the excess will be made on the basis of the appraised value of the interests being acquired (including the value of the reserved items) compared to the cash payment which will be made to the landowner if the Government accepts his counteroffer. However, this method of analyzing the counteroffer is intended for use only in determining the limitations of authority. The overall transaction must be in the interest of the United States and not afford an unwarranted windfall to the vendor.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Application and Limits of Delegated Authority.</E> The negotiating procedures <PRTPAGE P="151"/>outlined herein will apply to all acquisitions by the Corps of Engineers for the Army (military and civil), Air Force, Department of Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other Federal agencies which utilize the services of the Corps for acquisition of real estate. Delegations of authority to Division and District Engineers and to the Chiefs of their Real Estate Divisions to accept offers in excess of the appriased valuation have been made. Offers which do not exceed the approved appraised value may be accepted by authorized Division and District personnel regardless of the amount. Other offers will be handled as outlined in the paragraphs which follow.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Exercise of Delegated Authority.</E> The approval of a counteroffer over the appraised value, but within the authority redelegated to Divisions and Districts, will be evidenced by the Division Engineer, the District Engineer, the Chief of the Real Estate Division, or the incumbent of the position to which redelegations have been made, in one of the following manners:</P>
                  <P>(1) Manually accepting, on behalf of the United States, the offer to sell, as provided in § 644.87; or</P>
                  <P>(2) Manually executing a dated notation of approval of the purchase price, to be placed in the tract file, preferably on the original of the Negotiator's Report (§ 644.83(g)).</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of Counteroffers to the Chief of Engineers.</E> Recommendations for the grant of authority to accept counteroffers which are considered reasonable, but which cannot be accepted by the Division Engineer, the District Engineer, or the Chief of the Real Estate Division, within the limitations of delegated authority, will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for consideration. Negotiator's Reports, prepared in accordance with § 644.83(g) will accompany this submission; the contents thereof need not be repeated in the transmittal letter or in forwarding indorsements. The assembly will consist of the forwarding correspondence and the Negotiator's Report, with any additional material needed to support the recommendation of the Division and District Engineer. An analysis should be made of this offer as compared with other counteroffers accepted for the project, as well as with results in condemnation cases settled before trial. Signed offers will not be forwarded unless they contain deviations requiring approval by the Chief of Engineers. Appraisal reports are helpful and may be necessary reference for proper consideration of the recommendation. In the event the appraisal report was approved by HQDA (DAEN-REA), the forwarding letter should refer to the approval correspondence and data. It will not be necessary to enclose copies of the appraisal report. Where only a portion of an ownership is required, information should be furnished in the Negotiator's Report or in the transmittal correspondence (1) as to whether or not the remainder portion is considered to be an uneconomic remnant and (2) if so, as to whether or not an offer was made to acquire the entire property. Further, a statement is required as to whether or not it is considered that the acquisition will have any adverse effect on the acquisition of the remaining land required for the project.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Provisions of Military Construction Appropriation Act.</E> (1) Section 108 of the Military Construction Appropriation (MCA) Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-101) provides that no part of the funds provided in the Act shall be used for purchase of land or easements in excess of the value as determined by the Corps of Engineers, except:</P>
                  <P>(i) Where there is a determination of value by a Federal Court; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) Purchases negotiated by the Attorney General or his designee; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) Where the estimated value is less than $25,000; or</P>
                  <P>(iv) As otherwise determined by the Secretary of Defense to be in the public interest.</P>

                  <P>(2) The above wording, except for paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, constitutes a limitation on accepting or submitting a recommendation for approval of a counteroffer in excess of the appraised value. Paragraph (a)(1)(iv) brings military acquisition within the general acquisition policy required under Pub. L. 91-646. Future MCA Acts <PRTPAGE P="152"/>should be carefully examined to determine if any limitations on acquisition have been restored.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Local cooperation projects.</E> The participation of a non-Federal agency in a federally-assisted project will be in accord with section 221 of Pub. L. 91-611 and subpart J (to be published). Acquisition of real property by a non-Federal agency will be in accord with sections 210 and 305 of Pub. L. 91-646 and this chapter.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Negotiations on the basis of ownership; “Package-Deal” negotiations.</E> (1) Normally, negotiations for all interests in all tracts which are being acquired from one parent ownership will be negotiated at one time. These tracts will usually consist of all those to which the same basic tract number has been assigned. Exceptions may be made only where negotiations for some of the tracts in a series must be accomplished to obtain possession, or for other critical reasons. Piecemeal acquisition must be avoided if at all possible.</P>
                  <P>(2) When more than one tract is operated by the owner as a unit, negotiations should take place on the two or more tracts or groups of tracts, whether or not they bear the same basic tract number.</P>
                  <P>(3) In cases where an owner insists on a “package-deal” negotiation on all tracts in the same ownership, or having at least one common owner, the negotiations will be considered as one transaction.</P>
                  <P>(4) Tracts which are in the same ownership, but which are not operated as a unit, should, unless the owner desires otherwise, be negotiated separately, on the basis of the separate appraisals which would be prepared in this type of case.</P>
                  <P>(5) Under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the limitations of authority to accept counteroffers will be applied to the entire transaction.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Acquisition by condemnation if negotiations fail.</E> As soon as it is determined that a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached after full consideration of all reasonable counteroffers received, action will be promptly taken to acquire the property by condemnation proceedings, including the filing of a declaration of taking, in order to make funds available to the landowner and to maintain the project acquisition schedule. The landowner should be advised in writing, sufficiently in advance of the submission of the condemnation assembly to the Chief of Engineers, that condemnation proceedings will be recommended and the reason therefor. Condemnation assemblies will include copies of the Negotiator's Reports or other written records of negotiations. The estimated compensation to be deposited in the registry of the Federal District Court with the filing of a declaration of taking will be in the amount of the approved appraisal.</P>

L. 91-646, the Corps encompassed a very generous policy of priority leasing with respect to former owners and tenants, in order to ease the burden of people who had to relocate because of the Corps' projects. Recognizing the inadequacies of the well-intentioned attempts by acquiring agencies to make whole the former landowner or tenant, the Congress enacted Pub. L. 91-646 which was approved on January 2, 1971. It would appear that the Congress intended that such law provide for the fair and equitable treatment of persons who are displaced, without having to rely on interim measures, such as priority leasing, to ease the inevitable relocation. In House Report 91-1656, the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives noted the likelihood that adequate housing may not be available readily and indicated this as its reason for including the provision in the law that satisfactory replacement housing must be available before displacement. In view of this, it is incumbent on the District Engineer to be opportune in seeking out replacement housing and to be judicious in the early relocation of owners and tenants before market changes eliminate any available supply of replacement homes. It is also essential that the District Engineer be diligent in providing the required relocation assistance advisory services and benefits authorized by the law.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Possession by Government.</E> It will be the objective of the District Engineer to have the premises vacated and <PRTPAGE P="153"/>to cause unneeded improvements to be removed at the earliest practicable date and conform to the Congressional intention expressed above. In addition to the above, reasons for this objective are:</P>
                  <P>(1) To provide for the expeditious payment of benefits to former owners and tenants;</P>
                  <P>(2) To complete administration of the actual relocation of owners and tenants in a timely manner;</P>
                  <P>(3) To avoid maintenance and security problems with respect to acquired improvements;</P>
                  <P>(4) To prevent vandalism, trespassing and poaching with respect to acquired improvements;</P>
                  <P>(5) To avoid any implication that former owners or tenants may be permitted to remain indefinitely on the federally acquired property;</P>
                  <P>(6) To cause land to be leased on the basis of the most practicable size and configuration rather than on the basis of the size of the units acquired;</P>
                  <P>(7) To permit the general public to bid for the lease of federally owned land rather than restricting the privilege of leasing to the former owner or tenant; and</P>
                  <P>(8) To avoid a backlog of incomplete actions when construction or flooding is imminent or the land is otherwise required.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Possession reserved to former owners and tenants.</E> It is considered that the policy of granting priority leases to former owners and tenants has been overridden by the enactment of Pub. L. 91-646. Accordingly, this policy is being phased out, and where applicable, the acquisition agreement will set forth the dates agreed upon for the vacation of the premises by the owner and tenant without commitments, express or implied, as to the leasing of the premises after such dates. Procedure for providing for vendor's continued possession after the Government's acquisition is covered in paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Outstanding rights.</E> (1) When the United States is acquiring title subject to outstanding rights, the offer will differentiate between:</P>
                  <P>(i) Property which the vendor is excepting or rights which he is reserving and which are created for the first time; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Rights which third parties have acquired in the past, generally referred to as outstanding rights in third parties.</P>
                  <P>(2) Exceptions or reservations of rights which the vendor may retain, without interfering with the construction or operation of the project, will be set forth in the offer and deed by a clause following the description, beginning with the words: “Excepting * * *” or “Reserving * * *.” Any other outstanding rights, subject to which the United States is acquiring title, held by third parties will be set forth in the offer and deed by a clause, following the description, beginning with words, “Said premises are conveyed subject to * * *.” Negotiations with the surface owner will include the owner's interest in the subsurface, unless acquisition of a lesser interest has been authorized by directive or specific approvals. These negotiations will not include interest severed and outstanding in third parties by purchase or lease, unless the surface owner agrees to remove the outstanding interest or agrees to obtain a subordination from the holder of the outstanding interest if that is consistent with the acquisition plan. If negotiations with the surface owner are successful, an Offer to Sell will be obtained, reciting the outstanding interest in the “Subject to” paragraph of the form, unless the surface owner has agreed to remove the outstanding interest (or obtain a subordination, if appropriate), in which case the Offer to Sell must recite specifically that the surface owner is assuming this obligation. In order to carry out the requirements of this paragraph, the title evidence must be examined prior to negotiations or, in any event, prior to acceptance of the Offer to Sell.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Right to repurchase prohibited.</E> In no case will an offer be obtained in which the vendor reserves the right to repurchase the property. Such a reservation would be contrary to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of June 30, 1949, 63 Stat. 377, 40 U.S.C. 471, <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                  </P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">General reservation guidelines.</E> (1) Reservations of the right to remove <PRTPAGE P="154"/>crops, timber, buildings, and improvements during a specified period will not be permitted without express approval of the Division or District Engineer on civil works projects, the Army or Air Force using service on military projects, or the Federal agency, if other than the Army or Air Force, for which the land is being acquired.</P>
                  <P>(2) At the time of the approval of the acquisition by the Chief of Engineers, a determination will generally have been made as to whether subsurface rights and/or water rights will be acquired or left outstanding. Acquisition will be on the basis of such determination and as outlined below. Lands will be acquired subject to minerals, oil and gas rights or other similar interests severed and outstanding in third parties by purchase or lease and as approved by the Chief of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(3) Where it is not possible to acquire or subordinate an outstanding interest by negotiation and the interest will not interfere with the operation of the project, consideration may be given to obtaining a waiver from the Office of the Chief of Engineers on the basis of taking a calculated risk rather than resorting to condemnation (paragraph (k) of this section). Waivers will be considered on a tract-by-tract basis or on a project segment basis. Since such waivers involve several elements of the Office of the Chief of Engineers (Civil Works or Military Construction as well as Real Estate), the basis for the calculated risk must be fully explained.</P>
                  <P>(4) Concurrently with the negotiations to acquire from the surface owner, negotiations should be opened with the owner of the subsurface rights or other interests severed and outstanding in third parties by purchase or lease and required for the project, unless these interests are held in “block ownership.” Block ownership exists where a person, corporation, or other entity owns subsurface or other interests in connection with more than one surface tract and in sufficient amount for the entire interest holding to have added value, for operational or other reasons, because it is in a block ownership. In other words, block ownership exists when the acquisition of a part of the block would require the assessment of severance damage, even if the value of the interest or the amount of the severance damage would be in a nominal amount. On this basis, subsurface or other interests need not be contiguous to constitute a block ownership. Block ownership interests will not be acquired (or subordinated) piecemeal.</P>
                  <P>(5) Acquisition of the required interests, including subordination, held in block ownership should be started as soon as the extent of an operational unit is determined. As stated in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, all interests in a tract of land should be acquired at one time or as close in time as possible. Dual acquisitions of entire areas, one for surface rights and then for subsurface interests, should be avoided and acquisition of separate interests should be scheduled to coincide.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Reservation of buildings and improvements.</E> The reservation by vendors of the right to remove buildings and improvements will be permitted under the following conditions:</P>
                  <P>(1) Where the Division or District Engineer, in civil works projects, the using service in Army and Air Force projects, or the Federal agency, if other than the Army or Air Force, for which the land is being acquired, has determined that they will not be needed for the purpose of the project;</P>
                  <P>(2) The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be an amount negotiated at not less than the appraised salvage value of the building and improvements which are reserved, and such amount will be deducted from the negotiated price at the time of negotiation prior to execution of the offer;</P>

                  <P>(3) Where a reservation is permitted, the following clause will be inserted in the offer, following the description of the land:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>

                    <P>Excepting and reserving to the Vendor the right to remove (enter description of buildings) on or before ___ 19 _, which the Vendor agrees not to relocate on other land to be acquired for the project; provided, however, that, in the event that the said buildings and improvements are not completely removed on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically, and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to said buildings and improvements which remain without notice to the Vendor; and provided further that, in the <PRTPAGE P="155"/>event said buildings and improvements are relocated on other land to be acquired for the project, the United States shall have good and indefeasible title to said buildings and improvements without notice or further compensation to the Vendor.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <FP>The date on which the buildings or improvements must be removed must be fixed so that there is no interference with contruction or carrying out the mission of the project. The date for the removal should allow a reasonable time for removal of the improvements, usually not more than 90 days, except that for valid reasons the Division or District Engineer may grant an extension of time for removal. The right to remove such buildings cannot be prolonged indefinitely and certainly such right cannot survive the limited right of possession reserved to former owners and tenants as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</FP>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Reservation of growing crops.</E> (1) The reservation by the owners of the right to harvest and remove growing crops should be encouraged in order to conserve land acquisition funds and to avoid the costs incident to disposal of crops by the Government, whenever there is a probability that possession of the land will not be required prior to the harvest season.</P>

                  <P>(2) Where a reservation is permitted, the following clause will be inserted in the offer, following the description of the land:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>Reserving to the vendor the right to harvest all of the growing crops located on the above described land on or before __________ 19__. In the event the crops are not harvested on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically, and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to said crops, without notice to the vendor.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <FP>The date on which the crops must be removed must be fixed so that there is no interference with construction or carrying out the mission of the project.</FP>
                  <P>(3) The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be an amount not less than the appraised value of the crops as of the date of surrender of possession as disclosed by an approved appraisal report, and such amount will be deducted from the purchase price at the time of preparation and execution of the offer.</P>
                  <P>(4) Where a tenant has an interest in growing crops, the value of his interest must be fixed by use of ENG Form 1564, Consent to Offer to Sell Real Property, which provides that the value of the tenant's interest, as agreed upon by the landowner and tenant, will be paid from the purchase price for the land. The use of this form not only protects the tenant but, in addition, provides a simple method for extinguishing rights which the United States is legally bound to recognize. Where a tenant wishes to reserve the right to remove crops, it must be done in the name of the landowner, and in like manner. To accomplish the foregoing, any other form is satisfactory, in lieu of ENG Form 1564, as long as closing requirements are satisfied.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Reservation of timber.</E> (1) The reservation of the right to remove timber by vendors will be permitted only with the express approval of the Division or District Engineer, with the concurrence of the using service in cases other than civil works projects of the Corps of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(2) Reservation of the right to remove timber will be handled in substantially the same manner as that described for the reservation of buildings and improvements. If owned by a third party, ENG Form 1564 will be used in the same manner as for crops unless the timber interests are held in block ownerships. The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be an amount not less than the appraised value of the timber, giving full weight to any unusual difficulty in harvesting and transporting which are caused by the size, shape and location of the stand reserved, time limitations for removal, clearing requirements over the above those normally involved in prudent harvesting, and similar factors. If necessary, the stand reserved will be re-appraised on this basis. An amount not less than this appraised value will be deducted from the purchase price at the time of preparation and execution of the offer.</P>

                  <P>(3) Where a reservation is permitted, the following clause will be inserted in the offer following the description of the land:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>

                    <P>Reserving to the vendor the right to cut and remove on or before ___ 19 _, all trees <PRTPAGE P="156"/>in excess of ___ inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) located on the above-described land. In the event the timber is not removed on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically, and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to said timber, without notice to the vendor.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Coal, oil, gas or other minerals.</E> Acquisition of land or interests therein for project purposes will usually include the subsurface as well as the surface, except in areas where minerals have more than a nominal value. When the mineral, oil and gas rights have an identifiable value or are the subject of separate estates in the land, such mineral, oil and gas rights will not be acquired except where the development thereof would interfere with project purposes, but mineral rights not acquired will be subordinated to the Government's right to regulate their development in a manner that will not interfere with the primary purposes of the project, including public access, and not be inimicable to the environment. This is covered in more detail in subpart A. It is essential, however, in many acquisitions that the subsurface rights be acquired. In others, where these rights need not be extinguished, provision must be made in the offer the deed to subordinate such rights to project requirements, by excluding the owners of such rights from the area, or limiting exercise of such rights so that they will not interfere with the primary purposes of the project, including public access. The following guidelines are applicable in these cases:</P>
                  <P>(1) Where it has been determined that subsurface rights in the vendor, or outstanding in third parties, must be acquired, extinguished or subordinated, such arrangements will be made in the course of obtaining an offer for the surface or subsurface interests. Where the negotiations for acquisition, extinguishment or subordination of subsurface rights will be delayed, and it is considered advisable to proceed with surface acquisition to keep pace with project requirements, appropriate recommendations and justification will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for approval.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the owners of the surface and subsurface rights are agreeable, the separate interests can be acquired in a single transaction by use of ENG Form 1564, Consent to Offer to Sell Real Property. This method is the most desirable one, and, if used, the purchase price in the offer will cover both the surface and subsurface interests and the offer will not be taken “subject to” the subsurface rights.</P>
                  <P>(3) Subordination of the subsurface interest based upon the value of the minerals in place and which will allow continued production by the mineral owner or lessee must be pursuant to such terms as will safeguard the Government's interest and preclude a windfall to the mineral owner or lessee. Value of the minerals in place will not exceed the recoverable portion of said minerals using agreed upon production methods. See subpart A for detailed treatment in the section pertaining primarily to Real Estate Design Memoranda.</P>
                  <P>(4) When the third-party owner of subsurface rights refuses to enter into an agreement as contemplated in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the title to the surface estate may be acquired separately, and the subsurface rights outstanding in third parties acquired as a separate transaction. The offer for the acquisition of the surface estate will provide for the conveyance of all interests of the surface owner in and to the subsurface estate, as well as all surface rights, and provide for taking “subject to” the subsurface rights outstanding in third parties. In such cases, the negotiations described in § 644.83 will be conducted on the basis of the approved appraisal, less the appraised value of the outstanding subsurface rights.</P>

                  <P>(5) Where it has been determined that the subsurface rights and interests therein need not be acquired, but the owners of such rights must be excluded from the area, and the owner of the surface is the owner of the subsurface estate, the offer will contain a clause providing that he relinquish, for the period that title to the tract is vested in the Government, all rights to enter upon the lands covered by the offer or that he will limit entry and exploration in a named manner so as not to interfere with the operation of the project. If third parties own subsurface rights or interests, a similar waiver of <PRTPAGE P="157"/>the exercise of such rights must be procured from all third parties having any interest in the subsurface estate, whether as lessees or assignees. The waiver by third parties must be obtained at the time the offer is procured for the surface estate, unless these subsurface interests are held in block ownership.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Title exceptions—Administrative waivers.</E> (1) A distinction should be made between those title defects, objections, liens or encumbrances which, if not eliminated, might possibly defeat or adversely affect the Government's title, and those interests in the property owned by parties other than the grantor. All encumbrances, defects, and outstanding interests which cannot be waived under paragraphs (k) (2), (3), and (4) of this section must be eliminated or a waiver of the defect secured from the Attorney General.</P>
                  <P>(2) Title may be taken subject to an outstanding third party interest which has been administratively waived. Requests for administrative waivers shall be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for consideration, together with recommendations from Division and District Engineers. The recommendation for waiver should be coordinated with the using agency, if other than Department of the Army land (military or civil works), and should be accompanied by a certificate signed by the Chief, Real Estate Division or the Chief Appraiser, certifying that the outstanding interest has no contributory value to the estate being acquired and will not interfere with the purpose for which the property is being acquired.</P>
                  <P>(3) It has previously been administratively determined that all lands for Department of the Army (military or civil works) or Air Force projects may be acquired “subject to existing easements for public roads, public highways, public utilities, railroads and pipelines,” and “to the reservations, exceptions and any other outstanding rights contained in or referred to in patents issued by the United States,” and also “to water rights, claims or title to water, if any, or other similar title exceptions.” A decision as to whether any of these exceptions should be eliminated is the responsibility of the Division or District Engineer, after coordination with the using service if other than the Department of the Army. If such interests are to be left outstanding, they should be included in the “subject to” clause of the Offer to Sell.</P>
                  <P>(4) Offers to Sell may be accepted subject to subsurface mineral interests owned by third parties in accordance with § 644.86(d). In such case, the “subject to” clause of the Offer to Sell should recite the specific interest which is being left outstanding. Where it is not possible to acquire or subordinate an outstanding subsurface interest by negotiations and the outstanding interest will not interfere with construction, operation or maintenance of the project, consideration may be given to obtaining a waiver from HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 on the basis of taking a calculated risk rather than resorting to condemnation. Such waivers may be considered on a tract-by-tract, segment-by-segment, or project basis. Where a number of small mineral interests in a project are to be recommended for waiver, it is preferable that the recommendation be submitted on an entire project or group of segments at one time. Such a recommendation should specifically identify the subsurface mineral interests which are to be left outstanding, together with the estimated value of each interest, and should be accompanied by a map(s) on which the areas affected by the outstanding interests have been outlined. The basis for the calculated risk should be explained fully.</P>
                  <P>(l) <E T="03">Possession reserved to vendor.</E> (1) The objective in acquisition is to obtain possession for project purposes at the earliest practicable time. It is recognized, however, that there are occasions when possession by the Government may be delayed and provision must be made for continued possession by the former owner in order to meet the requirements of the Government's acquisition policy and to further soften the impact of the Government's acquisition. The retention of possession will enable the owner-occupant of farm land, or residential property, to receive <PRTPAGE P="158"/>his purchase money and remove improvements reserved by him, and permit occupants who may be former owners or tenants the privilege of harvesting growing crops and sufficient time to relocate to other locations. Accordingly, the Division or District Engineer may make provision for the former owner, occupant, and/or his tenant(s) to remain in possession of the land under the terms and conditions as follows:</P>

                  <P>(i) If the tract is to be acquired by direct purchase, the provision for retention will be written into the offer (ENG Form 42, ENG Form 2970, or ENG Form 1564) and will read substantially as follows:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph __ of this offer, (and/or consent to option) the occupant (vendor and/or his tenant) now in possession of the property, in consideration of the protection and maintenance of the land, buildings, and structures, and protection of the property against loss by fire, waste, or other causes, to which the occupant hereby agrees, reserves the right to occupy the property until _____. Such occupancy is subject to revocation by the (Division) (District) Engineer at any time by giving __ days notice in writing to the occupant if possession of the property is required by the United States; and provided further that the vendor-occupant or his tenant will remove no improvements or timber unless otherwise provided herein.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <P>(ii) When the tract is to be acquired by condemnation, the circumstances of the right to remain in possession, which has been established as hereinafter set forth, will be fully described in the correspondence forwarding the condemnation assembly to HQDA (DAEN-REA-C) WASH DC 20314. The retention of possession without payment of rent is directed to the benefit of the occupant of the property with some property maintenance consideration to the Government. This procedure will not be used to permit non-occupant owners a means of retaining possession without payment of rent and at the same time collect cash rents or unreserved crop rents from tenants.</P>

                  <P>(iii) When the land being acquired is utilized by the owner and/or tenant for agricultural or related purposes, a period of possession may be allowed, if consistent with project requirements, to permit the crop owner to harvest growing crops, and to avoid abrupt dislocations. The period of possession reserved in the offer, or for which request for the order of the court is deferred in declaration of taking cases, should generally be co-extensive with the crop season or the date that, by custom in the community, leases of such properties ordinarily expire: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That such period does not exceed 12 months from the date title vests in the Government. Reservation of possession or delay in entry of order of possession that will interfere with the Government's requirements for use of the land will not be allowed.</P>
                  <P>(iv) In the case of owner-occupied residential property other than farm residences, possession may be permitted for a sufficient time to allow orderly relocation, but no longer than 12 months after title vests in the Government.</P>
                  <P>(v) In connection with the acquisition of commercial, industrial, tenant-occupied residential property other than residences occupied by farm tenants, and special use properties, ordinarily the procedures of reserving possession to the vendor by a clause in the offer, or deferring the right to possession under a declaration of taking proceeding, should not be utilized. In such cases, after title vests in the United States, the continued possession of the property by vendor or tenant should be formalized by an outlease from the Government. However, if in the opinion of the Division and District Engineer a reservation for possession in the offer or deferral of order of possession is desirable in certain instances from a public relations standpoint or for other compelling reasons, such cases will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for consideration.</P>

                  <P>(vi) The reservation of use and occupancy in the vendor and/or tenant under the terms of the offer or deferment of possession must be based on adequate consideration to the Government. It is anticipated, however, that items such as the vendor's maintenance of the land, buildings, and structures, his protection of the property against loss by fire, waste, or other causes, and the fact that his possession can be revoked within a short period of time, will, in most instances, <PRTPAGE P="159"/>offset any rental for the period of the reserved occupancy or deferred possession which might otherwise be due. However, if possession is reserved by the vendor in the acquisition of commercial, industrial, and special use properties, or other type of property having a potentially high income factor, the fair rental value for the period of reserved use or deferred possession must be deducted from the agreed purchase price.</P>
                  <P>(vii) Special provisions for protection of the Government, such as those appearing in ENG Form 1366, Department of the Army Lease—River and Harbor or Flood Control Property, will be added to the reservation clause in the offer in cases where, in the opinion of the Division or District Engineer, they are necessary or desirable. If the case is not to be closed by direct purchase, the letter to the vendor notifying him of the Government's intention to file a declaration of taking will set forth the fact that possession is to be deferred and for what period, and will contain a statement as to the Government's expectation that the vendor will properly maintain and protect the premises, and perform such other acts (or refrain from such acts) as deemed advisable by the Division or District Engineer. Both the letter of notice and the reservation clause in the offer will provide that the right to possession may be revoked on 30 days notice to the vendor.</P>
                  <P>(2) It is recognized that farmers may experience difficulty in finding substitute farms needed for their livelihood within one year, and other owners and tenants may encounter difficulty in relocating within one year. Therefore, the District Engineer, as an exception to the procedure in paragraph (l)(1) of this section may lease properties to former owners or tenants at the fair market rental value for up to one additional year where the circumstances justify such action, and, in such event, the record will contain the reasons justifying the action. Any occupancy by the former owner or tenant beyond 12 months from the date the property was acquired by the Government will be covered by a lease and will provide payment of the fair market rental value of the property leased.</P>
                  <P>(3) The District Engineer, through channels, may request the Chief of Engineers to grant exceptions to this policy where unusual circumstances warrant such consideration. In keeping with the intent of this action, it is hoped that such cases will be minimal in number.</P>

                  <P>(4) The following will apply with respect to advance land acquisition projects. Former owners and tenants whose properties were acquired <E T="03">prior to August 1, 1972</E> will be allowed to remain on the property by lease on a year-to-year basis until the establishment of a land management use plan and thereafter, if the property is available for leasing, for a single five-year term. Former owners and tenants whose properties are acquired <E T="03">after August 1, 1972</E> will be allowed to remain on the property by lease on a year-to-year basis until construction commences: <E T="03">Provided,</E> The property is available for leasing. After construction commences, if the property is not immediately required for project purposes, such former owners or tenants will be allowed to remain on the property by lease for an additional two years. Continued possession of properties acquired after the date construction commences will be governed by the procedure outlined in paragraph (l)(1) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(m) <E T="03">Schools, cemeteries, and facilities of State and local governments.</E> ER 1180-1-1, Section 73, provides for the discretionary relocation by the Chief of Engineers of schools and other local governmental facilities, and acquisition of the sites under section 111 of Pub. L. 85-500. Section 73 will be followed in the acquisition and relocation of cemeteries. Where the school was formerly a part of an abutting tract, offers for the abutting tracts will contain a clause whereby the vendor or vendors agree to quitclaim all right, title, and interest whether vested or reversionary, in and to the school site in executing the deed to the United States.</P>
                  <P>(n) <E T="03">Reservations prior to completion of offer.</E> Where immediate possession of areas is necessary and is obtained by right-of-entry or the filing of condemnation proceedings, owners often <PRTPAGE P="160"/>wish to move, taking with them buildings and improvements, or wish to harvest timber or crops, prior to any offer by the Government for the sale of their land. This action is authorized only under the following conditions:</P>
                  <P>(1) Appraisals of all the land, buildings, improvements, timber, and crops of the particular tract are completed and approved.</P>
                  <P>(2) A determination is made by the Division or District Engineer that the buildings, improvements, and timber will not be needed, and the harvesting of timber or crops will not interfere with construction or operation of the project.</P>
                  <P>(3) ENG Form 1565, Agreement for Removal of Property, will be obtained from all persons having an interest in the property to be removed. This agreement will recite the amount which the owner is willing to have deducted from the value of the tract as a whole for the right of removal, which may not be less than the appraised salvage value of the buildings, improvements and timber, and the appraised value of the crops, as set out in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(4) ENG Form 1565 will be obtained and accepted by the Division or District Engineer, or the Chief of the Real Estate Division.</P>
                  <P>(5) If an offer is obtained later, an appropriate reservation must be inserted in the Offer to Sell to reflect the prior agreement relative to reservations and removals of property and the agreed value of same.</P>
                  <P>(6) If it is necessary later to file a declaration of taking on the particular tract, a copy of the agreement (ENG Form 1565) will be forwarded with the correspondence transmitting the declaration of taking assembly for use of the Department of Justice in the court action. The agreement by its own terms will serve as a stipulation as to the amount to be deducted from the ultimate award for the right of removing buildings, improvements, timber or crops.</P>
                  <P>(o) <E T="03">Loss or damages to improvements, timber, or crops</E>—(1) <E T="03">Insurance protection against risks.</E> The Government does not carry property insurance of any nature. Vendors, however, may be advised as to their liability for certain losses, and that insurance protection against such risks is optional. When buildings, improvements, timber, or crops on land being acquired by the United States are protected by insurance in effect when acquisition activities are initiated, the time and method of cancellation and negotiation for refund on premiums paid will be the responsibilities of the vendor. In order to avoid double payments to vendors, any amounts actually collected by vendors under the terms of the insurance policies for damage or loss occurring after acceptance of the offer by the Government will be deducted from the purchase price, regardless of when title is vested in the United States or the right to possession is exercised.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Fixing liability</E>—(i) <E T="03">Prior to vesting title in Government.</E> Buildings, improvements, timber, or crops on land acquired by the United States by purchase or condemnation remain the property of the vendor until title has been vested in the United States by delivery of a deed of conveyance or filing of a declaration of taking, and loss or damage thereto caused by fire, acts of God, theft or vandalism, before such vesting of title, will be borne by the vendor, except as provided below.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Possession by Government.</E> When the right to possession has been exercised by the United States under an accepted Offer to Sell, condemnation proceeding, or possession has otherwise been surrendered to and accepted by the United States, losses arising from damage to buildings, improvements, timber, or crops by fire, acts of God, theft, or vandalism will be borne by the United States. If, however, prior to vesting of title, the right to possession has been exercised, or surrender has been made and accepted only to part of the property, and the vendor continues to use buildings and/or to cultivate or harvest crops or timber, such loss will be borne by the vendor as to buildings, timber or crops retained.</P>
                  <P>(iii) <E T="03">Title in Government.</E> After title has vested, losses to buildings, timber or crops not caused by the willful act or gross negligence of vendor will be borne by the United States; provided, however, that if the vendor continues in possession of buildings, timber or crops, after title has vested, and the <PRTPAGE P="161"/>deed, stipulation or order of court has reserved to the vendor the right to remove such buildings, timber or crops, loss or damage thereto, both before and after removal, caused by fire, act of God, theft, or vandalism will be borne by the vendor, only to the extent of the amount deducted from the purchase price, as provided in the deed, stipulation or order of court, for the right to remove.</P>
                  <P>(p) <E T="03">Other reservations.</E> The following rights may be reserved to the owner wherever such reservation will be to the financial advantage of the Government and it has been determined by the Division or District Engineer that the reservation of the rights will not interfere with the operation of the project. These rights may be reserved in the Offer to Sell and in the condemnation estate but only whenever mutual agreement between the owner and the Government concerning all phases of the acquisition except just compensation has been reached, or by stipulation for settlement of condemnation cases, subject to approval of revestment, if any, by DAEN-REA.</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Rights-of-way for stock to water.</E> Reservations of rights-of-way will be permitted for watering stock, in the case of bona fide livestock operations, such as dairymen and ranchers. Such rights-of-way will be limited to a reasonable width and will not be permitted in public access and use areas. The reservations will be so worded as not to require the owners to fence the rights-of-way, but to provide that if they elect to do so, they must provide gates at satisfactory intervals to permit crossing of the rights-of-way.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Rights-of-way for water pipeline for domestic use.</E> Reservations of rights-of-way for water pipelines for domestic use (household, stock watering, garden, farm yard, but excluding irrigation) may be permitted by providing for the reservation of a temporary or permanent easement.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Rights-of-way for water pipline for irrigation use.</E> (i) In areas where irrigation is commonly practiced, or is of paramount importance, owners of remainder or contiguous lands will be permitted to reserve a sufficient real estate interest to place water pipelines across Government-owned lands, in order to obtain financing for irrigation development and/or in order to be assured of being able to carry on irrigation operations. In “water rights” States (prior appropriation of water rights), the reservation of such interests will be permitted only to those owners who have established water rights from the State, or who may in the future obtain such rights. When irrigation is a project purpose, such reservation must be coordinated with the Bureau of Reclamation.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under these circumstances, a landowner may be permitted to reserve an easement and right-of-way for a water pipeline and pumping unit across the land he conveys, by appropriate provisions in the offer to sell and in the deed to the United States. In “water rights” States, this reservation will be “for the exercise of established water rights, although no right to use water is created hereby.” (This phraseology is to be incorporated in the reservation.) The reservation will also include any pertinent provisions considered essential by the Division or District Engineer, such as requirement to install the pipeline underground and at a specified depth.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Reservations of this nature will also be permitted in those cases where acquisition is by condemnation. In these acquisitions, the reservation may be recited in the complaint and declaration of taking, whenever full agreement except as to just compensation has been reached, or it may permitted later by stipulation.</P>
                  <P>(iv) When the project is located in an area in which the Bureau of Reclamation is developing, or planning to develop, irrigation districts or systems, prior coordination with the Bureau will provide that copies of all deeds and final condemnation judgments which recite reservations under this paragraph will be furnished to the local office of the Bureau. Thereafter, the Bureau of Reclamation will be responsible for supervising the exercise of the easements to insure compliance with Reclamation laws.</P>
                  <P>(v) Plans to provide for irrigation will be fully covered in the Real Estate Design Memorandum.</P>

                  <P>(4) Acquisitions in which these rights are to be reserved must, of course, be <PRTPAGE P="162"/>based on an appraisal of the fair market value of the estate to be acquired. Since the appraisal would probably be made originally on the basis that there would be no reservation, revision must be prepared whenever the reservation appears to be appropriate, to reflect the reduction in severance damages or other financial advantage accruing to the Government. Consideration of counteroffers which include proposals for these reservations by the landowner will be based on and compared with the appraised fair market value of the estate proposed to be acquired. Deposits with a declaration of taking will be based on the appraised fair market value of the estate to be acquired by the condemnation action.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Preparation and execution of offers.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Fee acquisition offer form.</E> The use of the latest revision of ENG Form 42, Offer to Sell Real Property, is required in all authorized projects, except in those cases where agreements with the landowners can be fully reflected in an executed deed, and where the provisions of §§ 644.81(c), 644.82(a), and 664.86 are not applicable or can be fully complied with without the use of an Offer to Sell. When an agreement as to terms has been reached with the owner, or a counteroffer has been received which will be considered for acceptance or submitted for consideration by higher authority, a draft of the offer will be prepared, with particular attention to the following instructions:</P>
                  <P>(1) No changes or interlineations in the printed portions of the offer form will be permitted, unless authorized by the Chief of Engineers, except where the words “general warranty deed” are changed to another form of deed.</P>
                  <P>(2) Insert legal land description of property to be acquired, or attach description by Exhibits to be identified on page 1.</P>
                  <P>(3) The word “none” should be inserted in the blank spaces following the first and third lines, respectively, on page 2 of the offer form when title is being acquired free and clear of all rights outstanding in third parties and the vendor is not permitted to except or reserve any right or interest in the property to be conveyed to the Government.</P>
                  <P>(4) Particular attention is directed to § 644.86, regarding exceptions and reservations and outstanding rights in third parties. No exceptions or reservations of crops, timber, buildings and improvements, subsurface rights, or any other interest will be incorporated in any offer to sell unless the required approvals have first been obtained.</P>
                  <P>(5) In any case where the offer form deviates from the standard approved forms or contains any conditions, exception, or reservation contrary to these instructions, the assembly will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for consideration with the recommendations of the Division and District Engineer. This may be done at the same time a counteroffer is submitted to DAEN-REA in accordance with § 644.84(d).</P>
                  <P>(6) The landowner's name will be set forth in the offer in the exact way in which it appears on record.</P>
                  <P>(7) When it is necessary for a corporate agent, fiduciary, or any person other than an individual owner to execute the offer, satisfactory evidence of the authority to act for the owner must be attached to each of the copies of the Offer to Sell.</P>
                  <P>(8) Where it is necessary to attach sheets to the offer in order to fully set forth the terms of reservations, exceptions, or outstanding rights in third parties, such additional sheets must be securely attached and initialed by all parties signing the Offer to Sell.</P>
                  <P>(9) The name and address of the person or persons to whom notice of acceptance is to be sent must be accurately set forth. The address where the landowner can be reached after he vacates the property, if different from the address to which the notice is to be sent, should be obtained.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission, acceptance, and distribution of offers to sell.</E> (1) For each purchase transaction, the original offer and four copies will be signed by the landowner and spouse, if any. A copy (5th) will be left with the landowner when the offer is obtained.</P>

                  <P>(2) Division and District Engineers, the Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions, and the incumbents of the position to <PRTPAGE P="163"/>which authority is delegated as provided in § 644.84(d) are authorized to accept offers to sell for the acquisition of land or interests in land and easements, licenses, permits, or similar acquisition instruments: <E T="03">Provided,</E> The price set forth in the instrument is within their authority to approve or has been approved in writing by higher authority. The Division or District Engineer may also delegate to Project Managers (including the heads of any field offices with responsibility for real estate acquisition) authority to execute real estate instruments by which land or interests in land are acquired by agreement with landowners, provided the consideration set forth in the instrument is within the approved appraised value or has been approved as provided in § 644.84(c). Upon approval of the offer or other instrument requiring payment to the landowner, a determination that necessary funds are available, and acceptance of the instrument under the authority contained in this subparagraph, the instrument will be numbered in conformity with existing regulations and will immediately be distributed as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) Original offers to sell will be retained at the Division or District for site audit.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Send signed copy to vendor as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section below.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Attached conformed copy to title assembly.</P>
                  <P>(iv) File signed copy with project records.</P>
                  <P>(3) Upon acceptance of the Offer to Sell, the Division or District Engineer will notify the vendor by transmitting a signed copy of the contract (accepted offer) to vendor by ENG Form 53, Notice of Acceptance of Offer to Sell Real Property.</P>
                  <P>(4) Upon acceptance of the Offer to Sell, the Division or District Engineer will notify the using service, in the case of military acquisition, that the Offer to Sell has been accepted and that the Government has “the right of immediate occupancy and use of the land,” subject to the terms of the accepted offer. The land should be clearly identified to the using service.</P>
                  <P>(5) Instruments which do not provide for payments to landowners will be distributed in accordance with regulations governing such cases.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Easement acquisition offer form.</E> (1) The use of ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, is required for the acquisition of all types of easement estates, such as flowage, spoil, drainage, road, railroad, utility, restrictive or safety (Army and Air Force), clearance (Air Force), and other required easement acquisitions, except in those cases where agreements with landowners can be fully reflected in an executed deed, and where the provisions of §§ 644.84(b) and 644.86(d) are not applicable or can be fully complied with without the use of an Offer to Sell. Pages 1 and 2 of ENG Form 2970, containing the terms and conditions of the acquisition, are standard and need no modification. The tract of land in which the particular easement will be acquired will be described in Exhibit “A,” and the easement estate will be set forth in Exhibit “B” to ENG Form 2970. Division Engineers are authorized to approve deviations in ENG Form 2970 in all cases where the easement does not cost more than $500: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any deviation from the estates listed in Figure 5-6 of ER 405-1-12, must have the prior approval of DAEN-REA. When easements are being acquired from a vendor from whom fee is also being acquired, ENG Forms 42 and 2970 may be combined into one instrument in order to complete the entire acquisition as one transaction.</P>

                  <P>(2) In the acquisition of easements for rights-of-way for access roads, utility lines, etc., which cross or encroach upon rights-of-way or property of railroad companies, public utility companies, cities, counties and States, ENG Form 893, License for Installations Upon Right-of-Way, may be accepted, at the discretion of the Division or District Engineer, provided it is determined that such companies, municipalities, counties, or States are not vested with authority to convey a perpetual easement and the granting of a license under the conditions recited in ENG Form 893 will protect the interests of the United States and grant sufficient use of the right-of-way or land for project purposes. Normally a license of this nature should be obtained <PRTPAGE P="164"/>for a nominal consideration. Occasionally it will be necessary to provide for the payment of a small fee to cover the licensor's engineering and administrative expenses. In such cases, the consideration for the granting of a license will not exceed $100. In cases where the licensor demands a consideration equal to the appraised value of the right to be acquired, consideration will be given to the acquisition of a perpetual easement by condemnation, if the licensor is not vested with authority to grant such an easement.</P>
                  <P>(3) The description of the tract over which an easement is being acquired should be prefaced by terminology similar to that of ENG Form 42 which makes the tract inclusive of the abutting owner's interest in contiguous roads and other easements, if any.</P>
                  <P>(4) Offer assemblies will be prepared, accepted, and distributed in the same manner as provided for fee acquisition, except that ENG Form 3422, Notice of Acceptance of Offer to Sell Easement, will be used.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment.</E> After acceptance and distribution of the offer assembly and the acquisition is ready for closing, payment will be made.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Cancellation of contracts.</E> If, for any reason, it is necessary to cancel a contract for acceptance by the Government of the Offer to Sell, the cancellation will be effected by using ENG Form 1572, Agreement for Mutual Cancellation of Contract. Upon execution of this agreement by the landowner and the Division or District Engineer, or the Chief of the Real Estate Division, distribution of the original and copies of the agreement will be the same as for the accepted Offer to Sell.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfer of tracts from purchase to condemnation.</E> If, at any time in the course of acquisition by purchase, it becomes apparent that acquisition by purchase will involve substantial delay or cannot be accomplished, action will be taken to acquire the land by condemnation.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Acquisition of land by donation.</E> (1) In cases where the acquisition of real property has been authorized and approved by donation, ENG Form 42, Offer to Sell Real Property, or ENG Form 2970, Offer to Sell Easement, will be entered into setting forth the terms and conditions of the donation and conveyance to the United States.</P>
                  <P>(2) The offer, when approved and accepted, will be distributed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(3) Title clearance and closing of donation cases are processed in the same manner as any other fee or easement acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Vacation of property by landowners and tenants</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice to landowners.</E> From the inception of the project, landowners and tenants will be instructed to notify the Division or District Engineer or Real Estate Project Manager, in writing, as soon as they vacate their property; to turn in their keys whenever possible in order that the buildings may be kept under lock; and to keep the Division or District Engineer or Real Estate Project Office advised of any changes in address in order to expedite title clearance, payment, closing action, and the distribution of funds in condemnation proceedings. Landowners and tenants will be informed that, in order to protect their interests, they should not move from their property and that the Government will not require them to surrender possession until:</P>
                  <P>(i) They have received notice of acceptance of an offer granting the Government the right of immediate possession; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) They have been served notice of the filing of a condemnation proceeding by which the Government has obtained the right of possession.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Complete appraisals prior to vacation.</E> Where an offer is accepted or a declaration of taking is filed, the individual tracts will have been surveyed and appraised. In condemnation proceedings for possession, there may be cases in which individual tract surveys and appraisals will not have been completed at the time the condemnation proceeding is filed. In such cases, landowners and tenants will not be required to surrender possession, and buildings and improvements will not be removed or destroyed in the conduct of construction work, until individual appraisals have been completed and photographs have been procured.<PRTPAGE P="165"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspection of property.</E> (i) As soon as a landowner or tenant gives notification that he is vacating his property, or as soon as this information is obtained from any other source, the District Engineer will immediately have a member of his staff make a personal inspection of the property and execute ENG Form 1567, Report on Vacation of Property. The inspection will be made with a view of determining whether all buildings, improvements, and crops on the land to be acquired, as listed in the appraisal report, are still on the land and in substantially the same condition as they were on the date of the appraisal.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Where buildings, improvements, and crops have been removed under a reservation in the offer, an appropriate entry will be made in paragraph (3) of ENG Form 1567.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Where buildings, improvements, and crops have been removed or destroyed in the conduct of construction work on the project, an appropriate entry will be made in paragraph (3) of ENG Form 1567.</P>
                  <P>(iv) It will be determined whether or not the land is wholly unoccupied and vacant and whether there is evidence of present use thereof for farming and other operations.</P>
                  <P>(v) The original report will be retained in the real estate project files. The second copy will be held for the use of the closing attorneys on purchase cases, or for the use of the local representative of the Department of Justice in condemnation cases.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Public relations.</E> One of the most difficult problems encountered in the real estate activities of the Department of the Army, particularly from a public relations standpoint, is that of the sudden dislocation of families, tenants as well as owners, and the relocation of these families. Special attention, therefore, will be given to their problems.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Payment of relocation assistance and acquisition.</E> Public Law 91-646 provides for reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by owners and tenants who are displaced as the result of Federal and federally-assisted programs. Payment of relocation assistance benefits and certain costs incurred by the vendor in transfer of title to the Government and certain litigation expenses incurred by the owner is provided for under that Act.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Other acquisition.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition from other Federal departments and agencies</E>—(1) <E T="03">Transfers.</E> Transfers will be obtained from other Government agencies after issuance of real estate directives. Muniments of title will be obtained from the transferring agency, if possible, and be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REP) WASH DC 20314, with the original transfer letter or document. Title 10 U.S.C. 2571 authorizes transfer of real property within the Department of Defense (10 U.S.C. 2662).</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Permits.</E> Upon receipt of a proper request from an authorized command, service or agency, Division or District Engineers and the Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions are authorized to obtain, accept, and renew permits from other Government departments or agencies for the temporary (five years) use of land (except public domain for Air Force) and buildings. The use of over 500 acres of public domain land must have prior approval by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (MRA&amp;L) pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 4165.12.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Withdrawal of public domain lands and right-of-entry permits for temporary use.</E> (1) Withdrawal of public domain lands will be necessary if a site is selected for construction and/or there is a continuing military use. Except in time of war, withdrawals in excess of 5,000 acres for military use must be by authority of an Act of Congress (Pub. L. 85-337, 43 U.S.C. 156).</P>
                  <P>(2) Requests for withdrawal of public domain land will be made to the appropriate State or Regional Supervisor of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Department of the Interior, by the Division or District Engineer, pursuant to 43 CFR part 295, as soon as a real estate directive is issued.</P>

                  <P>(i) If use the of land is needed promptly to meet a construction deadline or for other use, the request for withdrawal will contain this information, and the BLM supervisor will be requested to expedite submission of his report to BLM in Washington, and to <PRTPAGE P="166"/>publish the proposed withdrawal in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as soon as possible.</P>
                  <P>(ii) A copy of the request will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 (with a copy to HQ, USAF (PRER), WASH DC 20330, on Air Force projects), with request for assistance in obtaining issuance of the Public Land Order in time to meet construction or military use deadline.</P>
                  <P>(3) Pursuant to authority of 43 U.S.C. 416, requests for withdrawal of public domain lands may also be made to the appropriate State or Regional BLM Supervisor by the Division or District Engineer for the reservation of those public domain lands which will eventually be required for authorized Civil Works projects, in order to proceed with planning phase work and to prevent adverse private entry thereon. Such action will permit administrative jurisdiction to remain with the present Government agency for continued utilization not in conflict with the eventual purpose of the project. A copy of the request will be furnished to DAEN-REA.</P>
                  <P>(4) If a withdrawal is requested, the BLM supervisor cannot grant a permit to use the area; however, permits can be obtained for survey and exploration purposes, since these do not involve construction or military use of the land.</P>
                  <P>(5) Necessary rights-of-way will be obtained under the authority of section 507, Pub. L. 94-579, approved October 21, 1976.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Acquisition of outstanding rights on public domain</E>—(1) <E T="03">Acquisition of possessory rights to mining claims.</E> (i) Upon issuance of a real estate directive to extinguish outstanding mining interests in the public domain, and notification that the Bureau of Reclamation (BLM) has withdrawn the public domain from appropriation under the public land laws and the public mining and leasing laws, the Division or District Engineer will, if necessary to obtain possession for construction or other project purposes, recommend to the Chief of Engineers the filing of a complaint in an eminent domain proceeding, based on a perimeter description of the project, and the obtaining of an order of immediate possession. Thereafter, the Division or District Engineer will promptly determine the possessory mining claims within the area withdrawn, and he is authorized to acquire such claims for either a nominal sum or an amount not to exceed the combined estimated costs of obtaining a detailed appraisal report and having the validity of the claim investigated by the BLM. This authority is limited to $1,000 per claim.</P>
                  <P>(ii) If an offer to settle is made on the basis provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and is not satisfactory to the possessory mineral owner, the Division or District Engineer will request the BLM to investigate the validity of the claim. In such case, under Comptroller General Decision B-143921, the District Engineer is authorized to make an agreement with the BLM for reimbursement of the following:</P>
                  <P>(A) Examination of the claim itself and assembling of the evidence to support the claim of invalidity.</P>
                  <P>(B) The presentation of the evidence, the cross-examination of witnesses for the mining claimant and other related expenses (subpart A).</P>
                  <P>(iii) The Corps of Engineers is not authorized to reimburse the BLM for hearing of the evidence and the rendering of the decision as to the validity of the mining claim.</P>

                  <P>(iv) If determined to be valid, claims will be appraised and an offer will be made to the owner at the approved appraised value. BLM is authorized to determine value of the claims and the Division or District Engineer may wish to arrange with BLM to perform this service on a reimbursable basis. In the event the offer based on the approved appraisal is not acceptable to the owner, and a reasonable settlement cannot be effected by negotiation, the Division or District Engineer will forward a report to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 with recommendation as to whether the claim should be acquired by declaration of taking or be left outstanding. Those cases in which occupants were dispossessed under the order of immediate possession, referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, will be given priority attention in all phases of the procedure set out herein, including preparation and submission of declaration of taking assemblies in appropriate instances.<PRTPAGE P="167"/>

                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Acquisition of grazing rights.</E> (i) Grazing rights in the public domain are granted pursuant to the provisions of a series of Congressional acts commonly referred to as the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. 315 <E T="03">et seq.</E> Section 315q of this Act provides as follows:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>Whenever use for war or national defense purposes of the public domain or other property owned by or under the control of the United States prevents its use for grazing, persons holding grazing permits or licenses and persons whose grazing permits or licenses have been or will be cancelled because of such use shall be paid out of the funds appropriated or allocated for such project such amounts as the head of the department or agency so using the lands shall determine to be fair and reasonable for the losses suffered by such persons as a result of the use of such lands for war or national defense purposes. Such payments shall be deemed payment in full for such losses. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to create any liability not now existing against the United States.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <FP>It is emphasized that payments under this section are administrative; further that this section applies only to military projects.</FP>
                  <P>(ii) Upon issuance of a real estate directive to acquire or terminate grazing rights in the public domain or other property owned or controlled by the United States and notification that the Government department controlling such lands has granted a right-of-entry or transferred the lands to the Departments of Army or Air Force, the Division or District Engineer will initiate action to acquire or terminate such grazing rights as authorized by the real estate directive.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Appraisals will be prepared in accordance with subpart B and the guidelines set forth in Comptroller General Decision No. B-132774, dated October 9, 1957.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Discussions with landowners concerning acquisition of a ranch unit will be conducted in accordance with the procedures for fee acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(v) Offers will be prepared, accepted, and distributed as provided in § 644.87.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Title procurement and title clearance relating to the acquisition of title to any fee lands within the ranch unit will be the same as in any other fee acquisition. In preparing title evidence covering leasehold interests, a search of the records will be made by the Division or District Engineer Office and ENG Form 909, Attorney's Preliminary Certificate of Title, will be prepared. In connection with the search of the records, it should be noted that Federal grazing privileges may be pledged or encumbered with mortgages.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Acquisitions under provisions of relocation contracts.</E> (1) When land or interests therein, including subordination of minerals, required for project purposes are acquired under the provisions of relocation agreements negotiated in accord with Section 73, ER 1180-1-1, it will be necessary to procure title evidence covering such land and interests. If the value of interests so acquired is not otherwise determinable for compliance with § 664.84, said value will be determined by the Division or District Engineer by means of a memorandum appraisal to be retained in the tract file. While this type of acquisition does not involve the closing procedure set forth in § 644.70, so much of the title assembly described as is applicable, plus an executed or certified true copy of the relocation contract, will be used in the examination and approval of the title. The disposition of final title assemblies will be governed by § 644.71.</P>
                  <P>(2) The procedures described in §§ 644.81 through 644.88 do not apply to the extinguishment of outstanding rights, including subordination of easements and similar interests, under the provisions of relocation contracts, as differentiated from the acquisition of land or easements, or the subordination of oil, gas, and other mineral rights, to be utilized for project purposes.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Acquisition by exchange</E>—(1) <E T="03">Military.</E> The authority to acquire land by exchange for military projects is provided in 10 U.S.C. 2672, and in the Military Construction Authorization Act passed each year. As an example sections 601 and 702, Pub. L. 95-82, August 1, 1977, the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1978, provides in part, that “the authority to acquire real estate or land includes authority to make surveys and to acquire land, and interests in land (including temporary use), by gift, purchase, exchange of <PRTPAGE P="168"/>Government-owned land, or otherwise.” Title 10 U.S.C. 2662a-4 provides that a transfer of real property owned by the United States to another Federal agency or another military department or to a state must be reported to the Committees on Armed Services if the estimated value of the property is more than $50,000. A prerequisite to any acquisition by exchange is authority for the acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Civil works.</E> The authority to exchange land or other Government property for private lands or property in execution of an authorized river and harbor or flood control work or improvement is found in 33 U.S.C. 558b and 558b-1.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</E> OMB requests that each proposal to use Government-owned property in a land acquisition exchange be cleared with the appropriate Associate Director of OMB. Disposal actions where exchange through the authority of the General Services Administration or specific legislation is envisioned will be cleared with OMB prior to filing a disposal report pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2662. A draft letter to the Associate Director, Office of Management and Budget will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 stating the requirement for the new acquisition, the description of the property to be excessed, its estimated fair market value, and a justification for the exchange of that property as constituting its highest and best use. OMB clearance will be required before disposal reports outlining exchange proposals are filed with the Congress.</P>

                  <P>This Section describes procedures of the Corps of Engineers relating to the involuntary acquisition of land and interests in land on the basis of a physical appropriation or use by the United States.

                  <P>While the Secretary of the Army and Secretary of the Air Force have no authority to acquire interests in real property except under express authorization and appropriation made by Congress, the Government may, nevertheless, in the performance of an authorized act involuntarily acquire an interest in real property, for which the owner is entitled to just compensation. Whenever a plaintiff successfully prosecutes litigation which establishes that an interest in real property has been taken, the interest so taken should be confirmed in the form of a grant, wherever possible. The instrument should be recorded in the public land records and permanently retained in the real estate files, as evidence of the interest taken and as a protection against possible future claims of purchasers for value without notice. No employee or representative of the Corps of Engineers shall intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his property, as prescribed by Pub. L. 91-646. Examples of involuntary acquisition are:</P>
                  <P>(a) Damage to real property caused by flooding, saturation, seepage, erosion, or other causes arising out of the construction, operation, or maintenance of an authorized project.</P>
                  <P>(b) Damage as a result of overflights of aircraft.</P>

                  <P>In those cases where a landowner files suit alleging that the Government took his property or an interest therein, a litigation report should be furnished in accordance with ER 1180-1-1. Litigation reports will be submitted in quadruplicate in cases involving military installations, and in triplicate in cases involving civil works. District and Division Engineers will furnish an additional copy direct to the local United States Attorney in actions in a United States District Court. In addition to the information required by ER <PRTPAGE P="169"/>1180-1-1, there will be furnished preliminary certificates of title to properties subject to the taking, covering a period of search of at least 25 years prior to initiation of the action, and indicating the date of acquisition of the plaintiff's interest. Certificates may be procured commercially, or may be prepared by a staff attorney.</P>

                  <P>(2) Dates of commencement of use of the runway involved and of each extension thereof;</P>
                  <P>(3) Date of commencement of take-offs and landings by regularly assigned aircraft of the type (identify) causing the taking;</P>
                  <P>(4) Frequency and actual height of flight of the particular aircraft over some portion of plaintiff's property;</P>
                  <P>(5) Any applicable zoning regulations affecting use of the property;</P>
                  <P>(6) A drawing at an approximate scale of 1″ to 400′ showing the location and length of the present runway, its original length, and each extension, and also showing the location of plaintiff's property with relation to the approach-departure zone of the runway and the longitudinal distance in feet, measured along the extended center line from the end of the runway and the lateral distance measured perpendicular to the extended center line, of the plaintiff's property and of any dwellings thereon.</P>
                  <P>(7) A vertical projection of the drawing at an approximate scale 1″ to 100′ showing the approach-departure clearance surface at the specified slope ratio and the mean sea level heights of the end of the runway and of the plaintiff's property and any dwellings thereon; and</P>

                  <P>(4) Recommendation that there be included in the estate, in the event of settlement, provisions for the clearance of existing obstructions and prohibition against future obstructions, provided that circumstances will permit a delay in the acquistion of a clearance easement until completion of the litigation.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisal reports.</E> Appraisal reports will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314 after the Department of Justice has determined the date (or dates) of taking. These reports will reflect the “before” and “after” values of the property, based on the assumption that the United States acquired an easement on that date (or dates).</P>

                  <P>A complaint in condemnation, and any declaration of taking filed in conjunction therewith, will contain a citation of the congressional authorization and appropriation acts for the particular project, and any other applicable acts of Congress. Existing acts of Congress authorizing the acquisition of land and interests therein are outlined in AR 405-10 and subpart A. Acts of Congress applicable, generally, to condemnation proceedings are outlined below.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Military projects.</E> (1) Act of Congress approved August 1, 1888 (25 Stat. 357, 40 U.S.C. 257) authorizes the head of any Government department or agency to acquire real estate, otherwise authorized for acquisition, by condemnation proceedings.</P>

                  <P>(2) Section 2663 of title 10, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="171"/>of a military department to acquire by condemnation any interest in land, including temporary use of the site, construction, or operation of fortifications, coast defenses, or military training camps.</P>
                  <P>(3) Section 9773 of title 10, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to acquire by condemnation additional permanent air bases and depots, enlarge existing air bases and depots, bombing and machine gun ranges, and areas for the training of tactical units.</P>
                  <P>(4) Section 2233 of title 10, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary of Defense (with authority to delegate) to acquire by purchase, lease, or transfer, facilities necessary for the Reserve Components. The authority to acquire by purchase has been held to include the authority to condemn. Therefore, this section authorizes condemnation for both Army and Air Force Reserve Training Sites.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Civil works projects</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rivers and harbors.</E> (i) Act of Congress approved April 24, 1888 (25 Stat. 94, 33 U.S.C. 591) authorizes the Secretary of the Army to cause proceedings to be instituted for the acquisition by condemnation of any land, right of way, or material needed to maintain, operate, or prosecute works for the improvement of rivers and harbors for which provision has been made by law.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Section 5 of the Act of Congress approved July 18, 1918 (40 Stat. 911, 33 U.S.C. 594) provides that possession of lands being acquired by condemnation proceedings for river and harbor works may be taken, provided adequate provision shall have been made for payment of just compensation.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Section 6 of the Act of Congress approved August 18, 1941 (55 Stat. 650, 33 U.S.C. 701c-2) makes the provisions of section 5 of the Act of Congress approved July 18, 1918 (paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) applicable to flood control works.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Local cooperation.</E> Acts of Congress approved June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 632, 33 U.S.C. 592) and August 8, 1917 (40 Stat. 267, 33 U.S.C. 593) provide that the Secretary of the Army may institute condemnation proceedings for the acquisition of land or easement therein for river and harbor works which local interests undertake to furnish free of cost to the United States. The provisions of these Acts were made applicable to flood control works by the Acts of Congress approved March 1, 1917, and August 18, 1941 (paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section).</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Other pertinent statutes.</E> (1) Act of Congress approved July 18, 1918 (40 Stat. 911, 33 U.S.C. 594) provides that the United States shall have the right to take immediate possession of land to the extent of the interest condemned. The exercise of this right is subject, however, to the policy considerations set forth in the Act of Congress appoved January 2, 1971, Pub. L. 91-646 (84 Stat. 1894).</P>
                  <P>(2) Act of Congress approved February 26, 1931 (46 Stat. 1421, 40 U.S.C. 258a) makes provision for the filing of a declaration of taking in conjunction with condemnation proceedings and provides that title to the land or interests in land included in the declaration of taking vests in the United States upon filing with the court and deposit of the estimated compensation in the registry of the court.</P>
                  <P>(3) Title III of the Act of Congress approved January 2, 1971 (Pub. L. 91-646, 84 Stat. 1894) contains policies and guidelines for acquisition of land.</P>

                  <P>(a) Only in exceptional cases will the Chief of Engineers give favorable consideration to the filing of a complaint in condemnation, and the request for an order of possession, without the concurrent filing of a declaration of taking and deposit of estimated compensation in the registry of the court. Examples of situations in which complaints may be used are as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) Immediate possession is required for some essential military need and time does not permit preparation of an appraisal, title work, or negotiations.</P>

                  <P>(2) Condemnation proceedings are necessary in connection with a cemetery, in order to secure court approval <PRTPAGE P="172"/>of the relocation and reinterment plan in accordance with the procedure outlined in ER 1180-1-1.</P>
                  <P>(3) Where right of entry for survey and exploration, appraisal purposes, or other similar need is required, and there is no material interference with the owner's possession.

                  <SUBJECT>Acquisition by declaration of taking.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>If it has been determined that acquisition of a tract cannot be accomplished by purchase due to failure to reach an agreement with the owners as to value, inability to contact the owners, title defects, or for other reasons, acquisition will be completed by the filing of a declaration of taking in a condemnation proceeding and the concurrent deposit of the estimated compensation in the registry of the court. The requirements for a declaration of taking are set forth in 40 U.S.C. 258a.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Declaration of taking assembly.</E> The assembly to be submitted by the Division or District Engineer to the Chief of Engineers, with a recommendation for the filing of a declaration of taking, will contain the following:</P>
                  <P>(1) Seven copies of the declaration of taking. (Reproduced copies will be accepted if clear and legible). The copy to be executed and filed in court must be free of errors and erasures.</P>
                  <P>(2) Seven copies of tract descriptions and names and addresses of purported owners, identified as Schedule “A” to the declaration of taking.</P>
                  <P>(3) Seven copies of a segment or project map, showing the individual tracts outlined in red, or shaded in such a way as to identify them, constituting Schedule “B” to the declaration of taking.</P>
                  <P>(4) In acquisitions for Air Force and other agencies, one additional copy of each of the above is required.</P>
                  <P>(5) As to tracts which are appraised at $50,000 or more, it is necessary to have a least two appraisals for each such tract in condemnation. One copy of each appraisal will be forwarded with the assembly for those tracts valued less than $100,000, and two copies where the value is $100,000 or more. Also, a copy of the appraisal should be forwarded when there is a counteroffer of $50,000 or more, no matter what the appraisal is. In all cases where two appraisals are necessary, at least one will be by a contract appraiser approved in advance by the United States Attorney in whose jurisdiction the case will be filed.</P>
                  <P>(6) Appraisals must be on a current basis so that at the time of submission of the assembly, the review certificates should indicate that the review has been made within thirty days prior to submission of the assembly.</P>
                  <P>(7) Guides in preparing declarations of taking for acquisitions for the Departments of the Army (Military and Civil) and Air Force are contained in Figure 5-5 in ER 405-1-12.</P>

                  <P>(8) Each case where there is an accepted Offer to Sell on which we will <PRTPAGE P="174"/>ask the Department of Justice to obtain judgment should be submitted as a separate Declaration of Taking.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Negotiator's report.</E> Each declaration of taking assembly should be accompanied by a separate Negotiator's Report, ENG Form 3423 (Parts I and II), in duplicate, for each tract of land included in the assembly. The Negotiator's Report should be current, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, it should indicate a contact with the landowner, or his representative, at a time reasonably close to the date of submittal of the assembly, and should reflect that actual, practical and realistic negotiations were conducted in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 644.83. The Negotiator's Report should be complete, but should be concise and not made unduly lengthy by extraneous material. It should contain so much of the following information as may be pertinent:</P>
                  <P>(1) A brief physical description of the property, including its present use and highest and best use claimed by both the Government and the landowner.</P>
                  <P>(2) Number of discussions and date and place of each discussion, and a statement that the landowner was furnished a summary of the basis for the Government's valuation prior to negotiations.</P>
                  <P>(3) Statement of each offer made by the negotiator, any counteroffer received from the landowner, and any figures suggested by the negotiator in an effort to obtain a reasonable counteroffer above the Government's estimate of value.</P>
                  <P>(4) Where the discussions reveal that further negotiations would not be productive, a statement that the real estate representative explained that it was necessary that the interests be obtained through condemnation, not in the sense of a threat, but as an effort on behalf of the Government to secure an impartial determination by the court of the differences of opinion as to value, and in order to make funds available to the landowner.</P>
                  <P>(5) If the owner cannot be contacted for the purpose of conducting negotiations, a full explanation of the circumstances and the efforts made to contact the owner should be set forth in the Negotiator's Report.</P>
                  <P>(6) A statement that any remaining property of the owner enjoys access and is an economic unit, or if it is an uneconomic remainder, that the Government has offered to acquire the remainder.</P>
                  <P>(7) Where there is an Offer to Sell, the Negotiator's Report should include a statement that no separate representations were made in order to obtain the offer, if this was the case. If any such representations were made, they should be fully explained. The report should also include the negotiator's telephone number.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Letter of transmittal.</E> The letter of transmittal to be submitted with a declaration of taking assembly will contain the following:</P>
                  <P>(1) The date of the real estate directive or the date of approval of the real estate design memorandum which includes the land to be condemned, a statement that the land is within the approved project boundary line, and the date of approval of the boundary line.</P>
                  <P>(2) A statement concerning the availability of funds.</P>
                  <P>(3) A list of the dates of the appraisals of the tracts in the assembly and the dates of the last review thereof. If more than one approved appraisal exists for any tract, the deposit will be in the amount of the highest approved appraisal. If the value of growing crops has been included in the appraisal, a statement concerning same is required in the transmittal letter pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(4) A statement that all owners of land included in the assembly, whose addresses are known, have been notified in writing that condemnation will be recommended and the reason therefor. The information furnished to the owners should include the name and address of the United States Attorney who will advise and assist them in applying for withdrawal of the funds deposited in the registry of the court. The notice to the owners should also state the date on which possession of their property will be required.</P>

                  <P>(5) A statement concerning the date when possession of each tract included in the assembly should be obtained. This should include information as to when the 90-day notice was given, as <PRTPAGE P="175"/>required by section 301(5) of Pub. L. 91-646 (84 Stat. 1894), or if not required, an explanation as to why not.</P>
                  <P>(6) In assemblies involving other than civil works projects, a statement as to whether or not all of the land authorized in the real estate directive is included in the proposed declaration of taking. Any variance that may exist between the acreage in the directive and the acreage in the declaration of taking should be fully explained.</P>
                  <P>(7) For military projects, a statement of the expected local resistance to the proposed acquisition by condemnation, and the efforts which have been made to adjust requirements to the local situation.</P>
                  <P>(8) For those assemblies involving the first case in a particular project, information as to:</P>
                  <P>(i) When the initial land acquisition for the project took place.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The total acreage for the project and the estimate of the cost thereof; if available, two copies of the project brochure furnished to landowners should be forwarded.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Whether or not an environmental impact statement has been filed, and, if not, when it is expected to be filed.</P>
                  <P>(9) Two copies of each accepted Offer to Sell covering any of the tracts included in the declaration of taking will be submitted with the assembly.</P>
                  <P>(10) A statement as to whether there have been any Congressional inquiries regarding the acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Title defects.</E> If a tract is recommended for condemnation due to title defects, three copies of the title opinion will be submitted with the assembly.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Deposit of funds.</E> Two copies of the declaration of taking, as finally approved and signed, will be transmitted by the Chief of Engineers to the Division and District Engineer. Procurement and delivery of a check to the United States Attorney for deposit in the registry of the court will be authorized, subject to the availability of funds.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional information to accompany Air Force acquisitions.</E> Each condemnation assembly (complaint or declaration of taking) covering the acquisition of land for an Air Force project will include the following information and material, in duplicate:</P>
                  <P>(1) A map showing the base boundaries, outlining in red all land included in the applicable real estate directive, and showing the land included in the condemnation assembly hachured in red. In the case of an off-base facility, the map will show the nearest boundary of the main base with relation to the off-base facility, outlining in red all land in the applicable real estate directive, with the land covered by the condemnation assembly hachured in red.</P>
                  <P>(2) On the same map or a larger scale map, the following information on each tract in the applicable real estate directive:</P>
                  <P>(i) Tract number.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Acreage.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Ownership.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Contours.</P>
                  <P>(v) Existing improvements.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Proposed construction, including utilities, drainage ditches, and other supporting facilities.</P>
                  <P>(3) Summary of status of acquisition of all land included in the applicable real estate directive. ENG Form 3905-R will be used for this purpose. All discrepancies in figures for acreages and costs should be fully explained.</P>
                  <P>(4) If any of the land included in the applicable real estate directive is held under voluntary lease or leasehold condemnation, report for each such tract the annual rental, the period of time the leasehold interest has been held, and whether it is a voluntary lease or a condemnation leasehold. If the land is not under lease, this fact should be reported.</P>
                  <P>(5) If the United States has previously acquired an easement interest (clearance easement, safety area easement, etc.) in any of the land included in the condemnation assembly, identify the real estate directive which authorized the previous acquisition by number, date, interest acquired, acres, cost and method of acquisition (including lease number, tract number, caption with civil action number as applicable). A negative report is required.</P>

                  <P>(6) If severance damage is involved in any of the land included in the condemnation assembly, include a detailed statement of the facts and justification <PRTPAGE P="176"/>for the severance allowed, unless the severance damage has been adequately explained in a Real Estate Planning Report or a Real Estate Requirements Estimate, in which case such Report or Estimate should be identified for reference.</P>
                  <P>(7) A copy of the appraisal report on which the deposit in a declaration of taking is based, irrespective of value.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Interests included in declaration of taking.</E> (1) The estate recommended for use in a declaration of taking should conform to the estate approved by the Chief of Engineers in Civil Works projects and to the applicable directive in military and other agency projects. Any deviation should be fully explained and justified in the transmittal letter. Examples of estates which have been approved for use in declarations of taking are contained in Figure 5-6 in ER 405-1-12. A condemnation proceeding is an in rem action. The definition of “property” and what constitutes property is generally determined by reference to State law. Therefore, full consideration should be given to the applicable State law in connection with requests for deviations from the standard approved estates.</P>

                  <P>(2) Normally, under the “unit” rule a condemnation proceeding should include all interests in a given tract authorized for acquisition even though an Offer to Sell may have been obtained and accepted from the surface owner with an outstanding interest in the subsurface estate recited in the “Subject to” paragraph. In such a case, if it is necessary to condemn due to title difficulties or failure of the owner to carry out the terms of the Offer to Sell, the deposit will be increased by the appraised value of the outstanding subsurface interest. The only exception to including subsurface interests outstanding in third parties is in the case of block ownership of subsurface interests; <E T="03">i.e.</E>, where a person, corporation, or other entity owns subsurface interests under more than one surface tract and in sufficient amount for the entire interest holding to have added value, for operational or other reasons, because it is in a block ownership. In other words, block ownership exists when the acquisition of a part of the block would require the assessment of severance damage, even if the value of the interest or the amount of the severance damage would be in a nominal amount. On this basis, subsurface interests need not be contiguous to constitute a block ownership.</P>
                  <P>(3) If future negotiations to acquire or subordinate the subsurface interests left outstanding under paragraph (g)(2) of this section (or any non-block subsurface interests “excepted” from direct purchase cases) are unsuccessful, and the outstanding interest cannot be waived under the provisions of § 644.86, then acquisition or subordination of the outstanding interest should be accomplished by condemnation proceedings. In so doing, block ownerships should be condemned as a unit rather than on a piecemeal basis. Full information should be submitted with such assemblies as to the method of acquisition of each surface ownership affected by the subsurface acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Payment for crops.</E> At the time the declaration of taking assembly is prepared, it will be necessary that a determination be made as to whether the value of growing crops should be added to the value of the land improvements in determining the amount to be deposited as estimated compensation. The determination will be made as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) If the crops have been harvested, or it is known or highly probable that the crops will be harvested by the landowner or tenant, no deposit will be made for the crops.</P>
                  <P>(2) The approved appraised value of crops will be included in the amounts to be deposited in all other cases.</P>
                  <P>(3) The letter forwarding the declaration of taking to the Chief of Engineers will state whether the value of growing crops has been included in the amount recommended for deposit, and will set forth a statement of the facts upon which the action is based.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Filing and possession.</E> Upon the filing of a complaint, accompanied by a declaration of taking, the court has the power to fix the time within which and the terms upon which the parties in possession shall be required to surrender possession to the United States (40 U.S.C. 258a). Requests for orders of possession should be made only after all requirements of Pub. L. 91-646 (84 <PRTPAGE P="177"/>Stat. 1894) regarding possession have been satisfied.</P>
                  <P>(1) The Division or District Engineer will ascertain from the United States Attorney the date on which the condemnation proceeding with declaration of taking is filed and the date on which possession is available. The using service of the Army and Air Force or the local representative of other agencies will be informed of the date on which possession of the land is available.</P>
                  <P>(2) The above information, together with the civil number assigned to the case, and a copy of the complaint and order of possession will be furnished to HQDA (DAEN-REA-C) WASH DC 20314 within six weeks after the date the case was forwarded by the Chief of Engineers to the Department of Justice. If this cannot be accomplished, an explanation will be furnished by such date.</P>
                  <P>(3) Where an Order of Possession is obtained but the landowner refuses to comply, it may be necessary to obtain a Writ of Assistance from the court. Prior to requesting the United States Attorney to obtain such a Writ, all pertinent facts should be reported to DAEN-REA-C.</P>
                  <P>(4) The United States Attorney should be requested to have judgment entered in accordance with the terms of any accepted Offers to Sell immediately after the filing of the case, since delay in taking such action works to the disadvantage of the Government. Any difficulty in securing prompt action by the United States Attorney in this matter should be reported to DAEN-REA-C.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Amendments.</E> (1) If at any time it becomes necessary to amend a complaint or declaration of taking previously filed, an amendment assembly will be submitted to DAEN-REA-C together with a full statement of the facts requiring the amendment. The letter of transmittal should certify that the tracts affected by the amendment have not been adjudicated.</P>
                  <P>(2) No amendment should be submitted which will result in a revestment of an interest in property, unless a stipulation for revestment has been obtained from the former owner in accordance with § 644.115.</P>
                  <P>(3) If, after the filing of a declaration of taking, a substantially higher appraisal is approved for any reason, and a settlement does not appear imminent, an amendment will be submitted promptly to increase the amount of the deposit.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Alternate form declaration of taking.</E> An alternate form of Declaration of Taking has been approved by the Judicial Conference on an optional basis, and must be used where the local District Court requires. Under this form a Declaration of Taking may have up to 15 ownerships, but each ownership will be set up separately so that it may be included in a separate civil action. In other words, there may be up to 15 separate civil actions which are keyed in to one Declaration of Taking. An example of this type of Declaration is included in Figure 5-5 in ER 405-1-12. In this form, Schedule “A” will include the authority and public uses. Schedule “B” will include the description, the estimated compensation, and the estate to be acquired. Schedule “C” will be the plan showing the land to be acquired. It will be noted that there will be a separate Schedule “A”, “B”, and “C” for each ownership. The schedules may include more than one tract where the ownership is unified and is an economic unit. All of the civil actions will be keyed in to the Declaration of Taking by a Master File number. The Master File number must be used on all correspondence pertaining to tracts in this type of an assembly.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Revestment of title by stipulation.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>When fee title or an interest in property has been acquired by the United States by declaration of taking in a condemnation proceeding and it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to wholly or partially exclude said property or interests therein, or to acquire a lesser estate, such exclusion or diminution in the estate can be accomplished by stipulation with the former owner under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved October 21, 1942 (40 U.S.C. 258f).</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Required approval.</E> All stipulations involving a revestment of title must be forwarded to DAEN-REA-C for approval with a full statement of the <PRTPAGE P="178"/>facts, related data and recommendations. Approval of the revestment action must be obtained from the appropriate using agency. Such stipulations will not be filed in the condemnation proceedings by the United States Attorney until the specific approval of the Chief of Engineers is obtained and the matter coordinated by the Chief of Engineers with the Department of Justice. It should be stressed in negotiations that final approval of the stipulation is under the judrisdiction of the Attorney General, based on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction of price.</E> A stipulation for revestment should provide for a deduction from the agreed price or from the ultimate award of an amount equal to the difference between the value of the property originally taken and the value of said property after the proposed exclusion of a part thereof or acquisition of a lesser interest therein, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the stipulation should be an over-all settlement of the case whenever possible. If it is impossible to reach an amicable agreement for complete settlement for the Government's acquisition of the tract, an agreement as to the area and estate, leaving final determination as to compensation with the court, may be submitted with facts showing that the proposed action is in the best interest of the Government. The stipulation should also include a release concerning any benefits under section 304, Pub. L. 91-646 (84 Stat. 1894), because of the revestment, particularly when no agreement is reached concerning compensation.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Required information.</E> A sample stipulation for revestment is contained in Figure 5-8 in ER 405-1-12 which may be adapted to fit the particular project and tract involved. In this connection, the following requirements should be observed:</P>
                  <P>(1) The stipulation will not provide for any change in the amount of the deposit unless the stipulation provides for an overall settlement of the case or the entire tract is to be excluded from the acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(2) The areas in which the Government has acquired an interest and those in which an interest will be retained after the revestment will be fully described.</P>
                  <P>(3) The estates to be retained by the Government after the revestment will be accurately described; where the owner reserves mineral or other interests or use, appropriate restriction of exploration and subordination to the paramount right of the Government to use the property for the required purpose will be included.</P>
                  <P>(4) The stipulation should include, as part of the consideration:</P>
                  <P>(i) Consent by the former owner to the Government's acquisition of the revised area and the estates therein in the event the stipulation is approved.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Withdrawal of any answer contesting the Government's right to acquire the property and any interrogatories theretofore filed.</P>
                  <P>(iii) A waiver of any and all claims by the former owner, his heirs and assigns, against the United States, the State, County and political subdivisions thereof for loss of access to the land (where applicable).</P>
                  <P>(5) The stipulation will include, as an exhibit, maps delineating the fee area in red, the easement area in blue, and the area to be revested in yellow.</P>
                  <P>(6) The letter of transmittal in connection with any revestment in Civil Works projects should include information as to whether the area in which title is to be revested has a potential for recreational use without regard to the currently established public access areas.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Application.</E> The foregoing procedure applies only to instances where a declaration of taking has been filed. Where only a complaint has been filed, the necessary revisions may be made by securing a satisfactory Offer to Sell and deeds to the United States, or by amending the complaint and filing a declaration of taking containing the revised descriptions or estates.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Distribution, reservations, and title evidence.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>Distribution of the estimated compensation deposited in the registry of the court is the responsibility of the United States District Court. However, the Division or District Engineer will assist the United States Attorney in arranging for the distribution of funds <PRTPAGE P="179"/>deposited with a declaration of taking in order that landowners may receive either partial or total payment as soon as possible.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Distribution.</E> Partial or total distribution may be made upon a showing to the court that the claimant is the proper person to receive the money on deposit (40 U.S.C. 258a). An examination of the title evidence by the United States Attorney, together with a physical inspection of the premises, is usually sufficient to enable the United States Attorney to ascertain the proper claimants so that he may consent to the entry of an order of distribution. Distribution may be made without prejudice to the owner's right to contest for a higher award than the sum deposited by the United States.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection and title evidence.</E> As soon as a condemnation proceeding is filed, a physical inspection of the premises will be made and the United States Attorney will be furnished the following:</P>
                  <P>(1) ENG Form 798, Certificate of Inspection and Possession, or such other similar form as may be requested.</P>
                  <P>(2) ENG Form 1567, Report on Vacation of Property.</P>
                  <P>(3) Title evidence and all available curative material covering the tracts of land included in the declaration of taking.</P>
                  <P>(4) Copies of all offers to Sell, leases, relocation agreements, etc., which are pertinent to the case and would be useful in making distribution.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservations.</E> If the landowners are to be permitted to remove crops, timber, buildings or other improvements from land acquired in the declaration of taking (by approval of the Division or District Engineer), a stipulation for reservation of these items may be obtained at this time. The stipulation should be in a form acceptable to the United States Attorney, should specify the date on or before which the reserved items are to be removed, and should provide that if the reserved items are not removed on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to these items without further notice. The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be in an amount not less than the appraised value of the crops, or not less than the appraised salvage value of the timber, buildings or other improvements which are reserved, and the stipulation should provide that such amount shall be deducted from the amount of the final award.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuation of title evidence.</E> A continuation of the existing title evidence will be obtained to include a search of the records to a date subsequent to the date of filing of the Notice of Lis Pendens, the Judgment on Declaration of Taking, or the filing of the complaint in those states where such filing constitutes notice. The additional title evidence will be furnished to the United States Attorney as soon as possible after filing of the case.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Procedure prior to trial.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> After filing of condemnation proceedings, the Division or District Engineer will maintain close liaison with the United States Attorneys and will render all possible assistance to the United States Attorneys in negotiating settlements, preparing cases for trial, and in conducting such trials. When the Division or District Engineer is informed that a case has been set for trial involving an unusual or novel issue of fact or law, or where the Government testimony will be $100,000 or more, he will promptly furnish this information to DAEN-REA-C. In addition, the Division or District Engineer should:</P>

                  <P>(1) In coordination with the United States Attorney, conduct discussions for settlement with landowners and other interested parties defendant. When a satisfactory agreement has been reached, an executed stipulation in a form satisfactory to the United States Attorney will be obtained. A suggested form of stipulation as to just compensation is contained in Figure 5-8 in ER 405-1-12. In this connection, the closest cooperation and collaboration must exist between representatives of the Department of the Army and the Department of Justice; no settlement negotiations should be conducted by Corps personnel without the knowledge <PRTPAGE P="180"/>and consent of the United States Attorney. If the property owner is unwilling to execute a stipulation until assured that the amount of the settlement will be accepted by the Government, formal execution of the stipulation may, in such instances, be delayed. However, the offer will be processed in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(2) Furnish maps, photographs and other necessary exhibits for trial.</P>
                  <P>(3) Assist in preparing expert witnesses for trial.</P>
                  <P>(4) Take necessary action to assure the presence of witnesses at the trial. District personnel who qualify as expert witnesses will be made available.</P>
                  <P>(5) Be represented at the trial by an attorney thoroughly familiar with Federal court procedures, condemnation law, and the details of the project affected by the condemnation proceedings.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Stipulated settlements.</E> (1) Where the amount of the stipulation obtained in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not exceed the high, approved appraisal prepared by an appraiser employed by, or under contract with, the Corps of Engineers, and the proposed settlement will completely dispose of the issue of compensation for all interests acquired in the tract in the proceeding, approval of the settlement will be recommended by the Division or District Engineer or the Chief of the Real Estate Division directly to the United States Attorney. The Division or District Engineer will inform DAEN-REA-C of the action taken, either by sending a copy of the letter addressed to the United States Attorney of by separate correspondence.</P>
                  <P>(2) Where the total settlement for all interests acquired in a given tract does not exceed $40,000 and the proposed settlement will completely dispose of the issue of compensation for all interests acquired in the tract in the proceeding, Division and District Engineers and the Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions are also authorized to recommend approval of settlements directly to the United States Attorney. In leasehold condemnation cases the monetary limitation includes the full lease term and not merely the per annum rental. DAEN-REA-C will be informed of the action taken in the same manner as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Even though the total settlement for all interests acquired in a given tract does not exceed $40,000, the proposed settlement will be submitted to DAEN-REA-C for consideration in the following instances:</P>
                  <P>(i) If the United States Attorney and the Division or District Engineer cannot agree as to whether a particular settlement should be consummated.</P>
                  <P>(ii) If the stipulation involves a novel issue of law or question of policy which would adversely affect the disposition of other tracts in a project.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If revestment of any land or interests therein or change in estate is involved.</P>
                  <P>(3) All proposed settlements not covered by paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section will be forwarded to DAEN-REA-C, together with specific recommendations of the Division and District Engineers and a full statement of the facts. Three copies of the signed stipulation will be forwarded to DAEN-REA-C with the report in those situations where the stipulation contains any unusual conditions or terms. The report should contain the following:</P>
                  <P>(i) The amount of the deposit and the amount of the proposed settlement.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The amounts and dates of all Government appraisals. Where the Department of Justice appraisal is substantially above or below the Corps of Engineers' appraisals, the Division and District reviewing appraisers should carefully examine the appraisals and ascertain whether the facts in the case and the appraisal techniques have been consistently applied, and should prepare a comparative analysis.</P>
                  <P>(iii) The appraisal valuations by the property owners, their appraisers, or other witnesses who may testify for the owners, if such can be ascertained.</P>
                  <P>(iv) A statement of the recommendation of the United States Attorney as to the proposed settlement.</P>

                  <P>(v) Such other matters as should be considered by the Chief of Engineers in determining whether the proposed settlement is satisfactory; e.g., any pattern of awards which has been established as the result of other trials concerning land at the same project, or in <PRTPAGE P="181"/>the same Federal judicial district, disposition of any accepted Offer to Sell, any unusual legal or factual issues involved, any unusual factors which would increase the hazard of proceeding to trial, or the anticipated effect of the settlement on remaining acquisition in the project.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Whether or not funds are available to satisfy any deficiency.</P>
                  <P>(vii) The report should contain the required information in tabulated form. For each item the statement should be short and concise; lengthy reports are not required.</P>
                  <P>(4) A copy of the report and recommendation sent to the Chief of Engineers will be immediately transmitted to the United States Attorney. If the settlement is satisfactory, the Chief of Engineers will forward a letter of approval to the Department of Justice, recommending that the stipulation be approved, filed and judgment entered thereon. A copy of the letter of approval will be sent to the Division or District Engineer. Receipt of such copy is authority to satisfy the judgment when entered, provided funds are available.</P>
                  <P>(5) If a stipulation is obtained by a United States Attorney in excess of their authority, they will forward the proposed settlement to the Department of Justice. Simultaneously, in accordance with procedures agreed upon by the Chief of Engineers and the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney will transmit copies of the transmittal letter and of the proposed stipulation to the Division or District. The Division or District Engineer will immediately forward the letter outlined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to the Chief of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(6) All settlements negotiated for interests acquired in condemnation proceedings will be inclusive of interest and will include all claims of any nature arising as a result of the taking of the estate recited in the complaint or declaration of taking, with the exception of benefits to which the landowner may be entitled under Pub. L. 91-646 (84 Stat. 1894). In lease-hold condemnation cases, all proposed settlements should include not only an agreement as to compensation for the period of the leasehold but also an agreement as to any and all claims arising from restoration of the premises, if known (§ 644.121(b)).</P>
                  <P>(7) Where surface and subsurface interests are acquired in a single condemnation proceeding, it is desirable to settle by stipulation, or to go to trial, on the “unit” basis. Many United States Attorneys insists on this course of action. However, Division or District Engineer should cooperate with United States Attorneys who wish to negotiate for stipulated settlements which may not include all of the interests acquired in a given proceeding as to a specific tract or tracts, provided appraisal reports have been prepared in such a manner as to make the appraised value of the several interests ascertainable.</P>
                  <P>(8) If an offer of settlement is not intended to include the full interest which was condemned in a particular tract, the letter transmitting the settlement offer will specifically identify the interests included in the settlement, the interests which remain unsettled, and the amount of estimated compensation remaining on deposit for the unsettled interests. The amounts remaining on deposit for the unsettled interests should be the appraised valuation of such interests.</P>
                  <P>(9) Landowners will be advised during negotiations for settlement that offers to settle are not binding on the United States until accepted by a duly authorized representative of the Department of Justice.</P>

                  <P>(10) In cases where tracts which are covered by accepted Offers to Sell are acquired by declaration of taking because of title defects or the failure of the landowner to carry out the terms of the Offer to Sell, the United States Attorney will be informed by letter and furnished copies of the Offer to Sell. The consideration contained in the Offer to Sell is considered binding upon the landowner despite the fact that condemnation is used to acquire title to the land. No settlement will be approved by the Division or District Engineer in an amount exceeding the amount contained in the Offer to Sell unless the Offer has been set aside by court order. Reports submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section will contain a statement as to <PRTPAGE P="182"/>the status of any Offer to Sell which may have been accepted.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisal review.</E> Land and Natural Resources Division Directive No. 11-68, dated 22 November 1968, provides that where two or more appraisals for a particular property have a valuation spread in excess of 10 percent of the high appraisal figure, the United States Attorney should submit such appraisals to the local representative of the Corps for approval. Every effort should be taken to see that this policy is followed so that the Corps has full knowledge of the appraisal reports on which settlement negotiations or trial preparation is based. In those instances where the United States Attorney and the Division or District Engineer cannot agree as to whether an appraisal or appraiser should be used at trial or in connection with settlement negotiations, copies of all appraisals, together with the analysis of the reviewing appraiser, should be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314 for further consideration and possible discussion with the Department of Justice.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Awards.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval by Division or District.</E> Division or District Engineers and the Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions have been authorized to approve court awards (including jury or commission awards) where such awards do not exceed the highest testimony presented at the trial by a qualified appraiser employed by the Government. In such cases, the United States Attorney will be notified that the award is approved and the Chief of Engineers will be notified of such action.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Approval by Chief of Engineers.</E> (1) If the award is in excess of the highest testimony presented at the trial by a qualified appraiser employed by the Government, or involves a matter of a doubtful or controversial nature, a report concerning the trial will be forwarded by the Division or District Engineer to DAEN-REA-C. The report should contain, but not be limited to, the following information:</P>
                  <P>(i) The amount of the verdict or award.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The appraisal valuations given in testimony by all witnesses, including any pertinent comments on the effectiveness of the witnesses, as appropriate.</P>
                  <P>(iii) A statement of the recommendations of the United States Attorney as to the acceptance of the verdict or award, if available without causing a delay in submittal of the report.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Where the trial concerned less than all interests acquired in a given tract, the report should state the precise interests adjudicated at the trial, the other interests which remain unadjudicated, the proposed disposition of the unadjudicated interests and the amount of the deposit allocated to the unadjudicated interests.</P>
                  <P>(v) Whether or not funds are available to satisfy any deficiency plus interest.</P>
                  <P>(2) Long narrative reports of the events at the trial or hearing are not necessary except in unusual cases. A brief, but complete, statement of the pertinent facts will be adequate in most cases. A form for use in connection with submission of trial reports is included in Figure 5-9 in ER 405-1-12; however, it is not intended that this form constitute the entire report. Where the case was tried by a Commission, copies of the Commissioners' Report will be submitted with each copy of the trial report. Close liaison must be maintained with the United States Attorney's Office in order that these reports will be received promptly after they are filed in the case.</P>

                  <P>(3) The report outlined above should be accompanied by the recommendation of the Division or District Engineer as to what action should be taken with respect to the Commissioner's Report, court award or jury verdict. This recommendation should include a discussion of any matters which should be considered by the Chief of Engineers in determining whether the award is satisfactory, e.g., the history of past awards at this project or in the same judicial district, the basis used by the commission in arriving at its determination of value, whether enhancement from the project or a second taking was an issue, the disposition of any accepted Offer to Sell on any tract involved in the trial, etc. (The basis of findings of value to be included in the report of a commission appointed under Rule 71A(h) was considered by <PRTPAGE P="183"/>the Supreme Court in <E T="03">United States</E> v. <E T="03">Merz,</E> 376 U.S. 192). Where the recommendation is to reject the award, specific reasons with supporting legal analysis should be given. The fact, standing alone, that an award is considered excessive is not sufficient reason upon which to base an appeal.</P>
                  <P>(4) The report and recommendation should be received by the Chief of Engineers within five working days after the Commissioners' Report has been filed or the trial concluded. In order to accomplish reporting within the prescribed time limits, District Engineers will forward reports and recommendations direct to DAEN-REA-C, with a copy to the appropriate Division Engineer. The Division Engineer will submit comments and recommendations to DAEN-REA-C within three working days after receipt of the copy of the District Engineer's report. The District must insure that our right to object is extended if the situation warrants.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of awards and settlements.</E> (1) If an award or stipulated settlement requires the deposit of a deficiency, judgment will be entered by the court and thereafter transmitted to the Division or District Engineer by the Department of Justice for procurement of a check for deposit in the registry of the court in satisfaction of the final judgment.</P>
                  <P>(2) The copy of the letter from the Chief of Engineers to the Department of Justice recommending approval of an award or settlement, if required under §§ 644.117(b)(3) and 644.118(b), will constitute authority for payment of the deficiency, provided funds are available. If approval is not recommended by the Chief of Engineers to the Department of Justice and the judgment is submitted to the Division or District Engineer for payment, it should be forwarded to DAEN-REA-C without action. Upon receipt of a judgment where payment is authorized and funds are available, the Division or District Engineer will immediately procure and deliver the check to the United States Attorney and inform DAEN-REA-C of the action taken.</P>

Requests for the institution of proceedings in the name of the United States will be addressed by the local parties to the Secretary of the Army and submitted to the Division or District Engineer. No land will be acquired on behalf of local interests by the filing of condemnation proceedings until local interests have <PRTPAGE P="184"/>furnished the Division or District Engineer with satisfactory assurances in accordance with the authorization act, and sufficient funds have been deposited with the Division or District Engineer to pay the expenses of the proceedings and any awards that may be made in the proceedings.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Corps of Engineers will institute condemnation proceedings on behalf of a local interest only when the local interest:</P>

                  <P>(2) Cannot obtain possession by local eminent domain proceedings in time to meet the construction schedule; or</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for extension.</E> The interest acquired in land by a leasehold condemnation proceeding terminates after a one-year term, unless notice to extend the term is filed in the appropriate United States District Court. In all leasehold cases, the Division or District Engineer will ascertain from the using service whether the premises included in such condemnation proceedings will be required for an additional term. This should be done sufficiently in advance of the end of the term to allow adequate time for the action necessary to extend the term. These instructions apply to civil works projects as well as military projects.</P>
                  <P>(1) The Department of the Air Force will ascertain and advise the Chief of Engineers concerning the future requirements for the land in Air Force leasehold cases. Where the Department of the Air Force has a continuing requirement for land included in condemnation leasehold cases which are not extendible, the appropriate Division and District Engineers will be informed at the earliest practicable date.</P>
                  <P>(2) Extension of the term in a leasehold condemnation case must be accomplished through the Department of Justice which, upon request of the Chief of Engineers, will issue instructions to its field representatives to prepare a notice of election to extend the term and file it in the appropriate United States District Court. The Chief of Engineers should be advised of requirements of using services for extension of leasehold condemnation cases five months prior to the time that filing notice of extension with the court is due. The majority of pending leasehold condemnation cases require that notice to extend the term be filed with the court 30 days prior to the end of the term, although a few cases require the notice of extension to be filed at least 60 days prior to the end of the term. Negative reports are required.</P>

                  <P>(3) Since the General Services Administration is the disposal agency for excess and surplus airport property, all condemnation leaseholds forming an integral part of an airport should be extended and kept in force with the concurrence of the Department of the Air Force unless and until contrary instructions are received from the General Services Administration. In the event a bombing range or other installation in which leasehold interests have been acquired by condemnation is <PRTPAGE P="185"/>excess or surplus, but will not be decontaminated or dedudded prior to the end of the term, the leasehold condemnation proceeding will be extended beyond that date. In reporting leasehold condemnation cases to be extended within the categories mentioned in this paragraph, full information as to the necessity for extensions in each case should be furnished DAEN-REA-C.</P>
                  <P>(4) Specific authorization for deposit of funds in condemnation leasehold cases will be issued to Division and District Engineers by the Chief of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Termination of leasehold condemnation proceedings.</E> If the need for all or part of the land included in a leasehold condemnation proceeding should terminate prior to the expiration of the term condemned, in the case of fixed term estates, or prior to the expiration of the right to renew by filing notice of extension, the Division or District Engineer, upon notification by the using service that the land is no longer needed, shall advise DAEN-REA-C accordingly. Prompt action will be taken by the Division or District Engineer to comply with the applicable requirements of subpart I (to be published) relative to screening real property excess to one component of the Department of Defense with all other components and Federal agencies outside of the Department of Defense. Where restoration is involved, a report will be furnished DAEN-REA-C setting forth the status thereof.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Report to close leasehold condemnation cases.</E> When the term condemned has expired or all interests have been terminated and all interests have been disposed of by final judgment, the Division or District Engineer will so advise DAEN-REA-C in order that the case may be closed. Report in accordance with § 644.119(b) shall be furnished and shall also include a statement that the issue of restoration has been settled.</P>

                  <P>Sections 644.131 through 644.142 outline the procedures of the Corps of Engineers for the leasing of real estate and interests therein for military and civil works purposes. They are applicable to all division and District Engineers having real estate responsibilities. To the extent practicable, these procedures will be followed by overseas commanders, in conjuction with the provisions of AR 405-10, Chapter 3. In general, these procedures also apply to the leasing of land and improvements for other Government agencies which authorize the Corps to acquire leasehold interests.</P>

                  <P>(3) Make recommendations to the using services and/or the Chief of Engineers on important lease and lease planning matters.</P>
                  <P>(4) Report controversial or unusual leasing matters to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314 by the submission of a summary of the facts, copies or proposed lease documents, and other data, together with recommendations thereon.</P>
                  <P>(b) In accordance with Reoganization Plan No. 18 of 1950 (40 U.S.C. 304c) and under the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 471), the Public Buildings Service of GSA assumed all functions with respect to the acquisition by lease of general-purpose space; the assignment and reassignment of such leased space and of Government-owned space; and the operation, maintenance, and custody thereof in selected urban centers. The Administrator, GSA, is authorized to assign and reassign office space in the United States upon his determination that such assignments or reassignments are advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, or national security after consulting with the heads of the executive agencies concerned.</P>
                  <P>(c) Reorganization Plan No. 18 also provided that the Administrator may delegate any function transferred to him to the head of any agency of the executive branch of the Government.</P>
                  <P>(d) Reorganization Plan No. 18 did not transfer to the Administrator any function with respect to:</P>
                  <P>(1) Buildings or space in buildings located on a military installation, or similar facility of the Department of Defense unless a permit for its use shall have been issued by the Secretary of Defense, or his duly authorized representative; or</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Title 10 Reports.</E> Under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2662, a lease proposal or renewal with an estimated annual rental in excess of $50,000 (gross rent as recited in the lease or for each project covered by one or more leases) must be reported to the Armed Services Committees of Congress. The General Services Administration (GSA) charges a Standard Level User Charge (SLUC) for furnishing space. For title 10 reporting purposes, where GSA leases space at Corps request, the SLUC figure, if greater than the gross contract rental figure, shall control. For all leases which require title 10 clearance, the Division/District Engineers will prepare and submit an Acquisition Report to HODA (DAEN-REA-L), WASH DC 20314 in the format shown in Figure 5-10 in ER 405-1-12. The report will support an <PRTPAGE P="187"/>action to obtain approvals from the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Logistics and Financial Management) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and Housing) for the proposed lease prior to its submission to the Committees, and will serve as a basis for a hearing before the Real Estate Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. Draft acquisition report pursuant to title 10 for a lease renewal should be submitted at least 12 months in advance of the termination date of the lease. An explanation for any delay in forwarding the draft acquisition report is required in the transmittal letter if lease terminates prior to one year. Supporting data for this report will include the following:</P>
                  <P>(1) The geographical area in which the availability of Government-owned space was surveyed, together with reasons for limiting the area. The mission is to be set forth in detail, along with the reason(s) why space in this particular geographical area is essential to the performance of the mission.</P>
                  <P>(2) Current and required space (including parking) for each using service. For GSA leases the square feet should be the same as reported on the SLUC. Corrected square feet may be reported if a letter of concurrence from the appropriate GSA Region is provided.</P>
                  <P>(3) Statement covering all Government-owned buildings and facilities under the control of the military departments in that area, together with the reasons why each was rejected. Even though no space is available, a list of the installations in the area will be furnished.</P>
                  <P>(4) Statement from (GSA) indicating that no space is available to that agency and other Federal agencies in the area or, in the alternative, a list of space that is available, together with reasons why the space is not acceptable to the using service.</P>
                  <P>(5) Identification of the headquarters and personnel making the determination that any available Government-owned space is not suitable.</P>
                  <P>(6) Original request, signed by the responsible head of the using agency that action be taken to obtain required clearances under 10 U.S.C. 2662. The using service shall advise whether or not a long-range use is contemplated.</P>
                  <P>(7) A statement of the current and anticipated contract rentals and current and anticipated SLUC for GSA leases. The SLUC should be as reported by GSA, unless an explanation is provided.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">The Economy Act.</E> Section 322 of the Act of Congress approved 30 June 1932, as amended (40 U.S.C. 278a) provides that no appropriation shall be obligated or expended for the rent of any building or part of a building to be occupied for Government purposes at a rental in excess of the per annum rate of 15 percent of the fair market value of the rented premises at date of the lease under which the premises are to be occupied by the Government, nor for alterations, improvements, and/or repairs of the rented premises in excess of 25 percent of the amount of the rent for the first year of the rental term, or for the entire rental if the full term is less than one year. The provisions of section 322, as applicable to rentals, shall apply only where the rental to be paid shall exceed $2,000 per annum.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Exception to Economy Act.</E> The Act of Congress approved 28 April 1942 (40 U.S.C. 278b) provides that 40 U.S.C. 278a shall not apply during war or a national emergency declared by Congress or by the President to such leases or renewals of existing leases of privately-owned or publicly-owned property as are certified by the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Navy or by such person or persons as he may designate, as covering premises for military or civilian purposes necessary for the prosecution of the war or vital in the national emergency. The provisions of the National Emergencies Act, Pub. L. 94-412 (90 Stat. 1255), 14 September 1976, shall not apply to the powers and authorities conferred by 40 U.S.C. 278b and actions taken thereunder.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Federal Property and Administrative Services Act.</E> The Administrator, GSA is authorized by 40 U.S.C. 490a(8) to alter and improve rented premises without regard to the 25 percent limitation of 40 U.S.C. 278a upon a determination by the Administrator that the alterations and improvements are advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, <PRTPAGE P="188"/>efficiency, or national security, and that the total cost of the proposed work to the Government for the expected life of the lease shall be less than the cost of alternative space which needs no such improvements.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Certificates of Necessity.</E> Department of the Army requests for Certificates of Necessity pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 278b will be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary of the Army through DAEN-REA-L. In any case requiring the issuance of a Certificate of Necessity, the amount requested will be sufficient to provide for all improvements which can be foreseen and that will be required during the term of the lease. Should unforeseen, essential requirements arise at a later date, an additional Certificate of Necessity to cover such work will be necessary. It is required that the using service furnish Division or District Engineers with a request for a Certificate of Necessity, explaining the circumstances, followed by a statement that the continued use of the leased premises, or the work to be performed, as the case may be, is vital in the national emergency. All requests by Division and District Engineers will include a completed ENG Form 869-R, 15 percent Valuation Certificate.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Approval—Chief of Engineers.</E> (1) The Chief of Engineers is authorized to approve leases where proposed temporary construction to be placed on land by the Government has an estimated cost equal to or in excess of the current market value of the property, or where the estimated rentals to be paid in the future, plus the cost of restoration, would exceed 50 percent of the current market value of the property.</P>
                  <P>(2) Leases, renewals, or lease extensions, which are controversial, unusual, or inconsistent with existing policies, require the approval of the Chief of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(3) Any lease involving clearances by higher authority will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314.</P>
                  <P>(4) Leases, renewals, or lease extensions of industrial properties, other than for bakeries, laundries, and drycleaning facilities, are to be submitted to DEAN-REA-L for prior approval.</P>
                  <P>(5) Division and District Engineers, and Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions, are authorized to perform emergency maintenance and repairs to leased premises not in excess of $500 where lessors refuse to perform, or under such circumstances that the lessor cannot perform. Where the cost exceeds $500, approval by DAEN-REA-L is required. The Comptroller General has ruled that where the lessor is obligated to perform maintenance and repairs under the terms of the lease and after demand of and refusal by the lessor, the Government makes such repairs in order to utilize the property to the fullest extent, the cost should be withheld from rental payments under the lease as soon as possible after work is completed (15 Comp. Gen. 1064). However, no rental payments will be withheld and no repairs made after demand and a refusal by the lessor, without prior approval of DAEN-REA-L.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Division and District Engineer Authorization.</E> (1) Division Engineers and their Chiefs of the Real Estate Division have been delegated, without authority to redelegate, leasing authority to approve leases where the annual rent, excluding services and utilities, unless said services and utilities are included in the recited rental consideration, is in excess of $25,000, but not in excess of $50,000. The $50,000 limitation will be strictly observed because of the reporting requirements under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2662.</P>
                  <P>(2) District Engineers and their Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions are authorized to approve leases wherein the rental excluding utilities and services, unless included in the recited rental consideration, does not exceed $25,000 per annum.</P>
                  <P>(3) Except for space in the National Capital Region, Division and District Engineers are authorized to process all requests for the assignment of space in Government-owned buildings or leased space in the GSA urban centers to the regional GSA office having jurisdiction.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Leasing guidelines.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>Division and District Engineers, and the Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions, <PRTPAGE P="189"/>are authorized to execute leases, or renewals of leases, negotiated in accordance with the procedures expressed herein, upon receipt of a proper request from an authorized command, service, or agency, subject to any required approvals or clearances. When there is no Real Estate Division, as such, but the Division or District Engineer has responsibility for leasing activities, he may delegate this authority to the officer or civilian in charge or real estate activities.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Leasing requests.</E> Requests for space or land will be received by the Chief of Engineers, or the appropriate Division or District Engineer. Requests will include the data outlined in AR 405-10 (para 2-2c). Division and District Engineers will coordinate space or land requirements with appropriate commanders to assure responsive lease processing. If required, a Lease Planning Report, or narrative report covering essential information, will be furnished the using service for review and recommendations. Funding requirements, usually in the form of fund citations, will have been met by the using service prior to lease execution. If approvals by higher authority are required, the Division or District Engineer will initiate appropriate action to obtain the necessary clearances.</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Army Commands.</E> Upon receipt of a request from an Army Command, negotiations for obtaining acceptable leases will be carried to completion in accordance with present procedures for military leases.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Air Force.</E> Upon receipt of a lease request approved by Headquarters, U.S. Air Force, or an Air Force major command, the appropriate Division or District Engineer will negotiate and lease the required property. The provisions of AFR 87-1 prescribe the Department of the Air Force policies and procedures that are to be followed.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">National Guard.</E> All requests for the leasing of facilities for National Guard purposes will emanate from the Chief, National Guard Bureau. Army National Guard leasing requirements will be transmitted through DAEN-REZ-R to DAEN-REA-L. Air National Guard requirements will be transmitted to DAEN-REA-L through Headquarters, U.S. Air Force.</P>
                  <P>(i) Upon receipt of authority from the Chief of Engineers, negotiations will be conducted for obtaining an acceptable lease, in accordance with the approved lease request. The appropriate United States Property and Fiscal Officer generally makes separate service contracts for utilities, except sewage disposal, and services, and is responsible for the maintenance of all buildings used exclusively by the Air National Guard. Representatives of the Corps of Engineers do not participate in obtaining contracts for utilities and services. In cases where such a contract is impracticable, the lease may include any and all utilities and services as part of the rental consideration, with the cost of the various services and utilities to be itemized. The “use clause” in the lease will provide for occupancy of the premises for “Government purposes”. The wording, “For use by the Air National Guard and/or United States Air Force, and, in time of war or national emergency, by other units of the Armed Forces of the United States or for any other use by the Federal Government,” will be acceptable if it is not possible to insert the for “Government purposes” provision.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Leases made by representatives of a State with private parties for use of premises by the National Guard of the State involved, under which State funds are used for rental payments, are not the responsibility of the Division or District Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Department of Energy/Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</E> Space is acquired by these agencies direct from GSA in the designated urban centers pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 18. In instances where general purpose space is not obtained through GSA and instances involving the leasing of special-purpose space, managers of field offices of subject agencies are authorized to initiate requests to Division or District Engineers for the leasing of properties where the net per annum rental does not exceed $50,000. Leasing of properties where the net rental per annum exceeds $50,000 requires the prior approval of the appropriate agency head, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the Secretary of Energy, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or their designees.<PRTPAGE P="190"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Metropolitan Washington, DC.</E> All requests for leased space in the National Capital Region will be processed in accordance with DOD Instruction 5305.5.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements survey.</E> The availability, use, and adaptability of property owned by the Government, whether under control of the GSA or other agencies, shall be thoroughly explored before additional space is leased, or existing leases are renewed, or construction commenced. Particular attention is to be given to the availability of space, or land, at military reservations, camps, posts, or stations.</P>
                  <P>(1) A statement covering the non-availability of Government-owned space, or if such is available and not suitable, reasons why it is not suitable, for occupancy by the requesting using service, should be made for each lease executed by the Corps of Engineers, excluding family housing leases.</P>
                  <P>(2) Suitable privately-owned space shall be acquired only when satisfactory Government-owned space is not available. Rental charges will be consistent with prevailing rates in the community for comparable facilities.</P>
                  <P>(3) The quality of office space for Government occupancy shall be appropriate for the efficient and economical performance of required operations, affording employees safe, healthful and convenient facilities.</P>
                  <P>(4) Full consideration shall be given to the efficient performance of the mission and programs of the using service.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Government-owned and General Services Administration furnished space.</E> If Government-owned space is available, the Division or District Engineer will inform the using agency, and details of occupancy will be developed. If it is necessary for GSA to lease space, the Division or District Engineer will make a careful review to determine if there are any statutory or regulatory limitations involved. If so, appropriate action will be taken to satisfy the limitations. During the processing of all GSA space assignments and leases, the Division or District Engineer is the only official contact representative with GSA. This procedure is to be emphasized at all time with the using service.</P>
                  <P>(1) The Division of District Engineer will submit a Standard Form 81, Request for Space, to the appropriate GSA Regional Office for space assignment in urban centers under the jurisdiction of GSA. The requirement to this form applies to lease renewals or lease supplements, and for space assignments in Federal office buildings. Excluded from this procedure is a proposed space assignment in the National Capitol Region.</P>
                  <P>(2) Except for the acquisition of general-purpose space of 2,500 square feet or less, outside the designated urban centers, and special-purpose space of 2,500 square feet or less, irrespective of the location, the need for any type of building space will be made kown to the appropriate GSA Regional Office by filing Standard Form 81, Request for Space.</P>
                  <P>(3) The designated urban centers are listed in Figure 5-11 in ER 405-1-12.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Advertising.</E> As a general rule, procurement of space will be by formal advertising. However, in leasing certain types of premises where only one location will serve the Government's purpose, such as municipal airports, recruiting stations, and similar facilities, negotiations without advertising are permissible. In instances where building space is needed and the requirement cannot be met through the use of existing buildings, there must be advertising to solicit bids for the furnishing of the space. In every instance, it is essential that efforts be made to seek competition. For each lease, a statement will be prepared concerning competition in the solicitation for space or land and Standard Form 1036, Statement and Certificate of Award, will be used. Where specific space or land is needed, and competition is therefore not involved, the facts and circumstances will be fully explained and such explanation will be made a part of the lease file for future reference.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Appraisals.</E> Appraisals are required as a basis for making rental determinations in all leases except those for a nominal consideration. At the discretion of the Division and District Engineers, and the Chiefs of the Real Estate Divisions, formal or detailed appraisals <PRTPAGE P="191"/>can be dispensed with for leases wherein the annual rent does not exceed $5,000. Where the rental of a building or part of a building, or family housing unit, exceeds $3,600 per annum, excluding services and utilities, it may be necessary to estimate the fee value of the property contemplated for leasing to determine whether or not the rental rate is in excess of 15 percent of the fee value of the property. For family housing leases, the opinion of fee value will be in short summary form and will be supported by general evidence of comparable values of the unit to be leased. If the proposed annual rental, excluding services and utilities, of a family housing unit exceeds 15 percent of the estimated fee value, the unit will not be leased.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of valid interest.</E> Persons executing leases for and on behalf of the United States of America will satisfy themselves, before executing leases, that the prospective lessors have an interest in the real estate which will assure the validity of the lease. Where leased lands are used as a site for contruction, the land records of the county will be examined by a staff attorney familiar with land title records, who will execute a certificate that he has examined the said records and that title is vested in the lessor, subject to the infirmities, liens and encumbrances noted in the certificate. In lieu of such examination, a certificate from the Register of Deeds, County Recorder or other qualified officer is acceptable. If considered advisable in unusual cases, title evidence may be obtained from commercial sources.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Outstanding rights and damages.</E> (1) Where the land is subject to outstanding oil, gas, mineral, or similar interests, the Division or District Engineer will determine, from the appropriate command, in advance of the consummation of the lease, whether the continued exercise of the mineral or outstanding rights will interfere with the contemplated use of the premises.</P>
                  <P>(2) Where buildings, structures, or growing crops are located on land to be leased, a determination will be made by the Division or District Engineer, in coordination with the appropriate command, as to whether they will interfere with the use of the premises.</P>
                  <P>(3) Where the lessor will not be permitted to harvest crops or remove improvements and timber which will be destroyed by the Government, the appraised value thereof will be determined, and such amount will be included in the rental for the initial term of the lease, together with an express provision relieving the Government of restoration.</P>
                  <P>(4) Leases of land for bombing, artillery, rifle ranges, and other extraordinary usage will specify that the leased premises are to be used for such purpose, and an effort will be made to include in the lease a provision waiving restoration and claims for damages, particularly where the premises are wastelands or unproductive.</P>
                  <P>(5) Where the lessor will not consent to a waiver of restoration, the estimated value of such damage, if it can be determined in advance, will be included in the rental for the initial term of the lease, and the lease will contain an express provision relieving the Government from responsibility for restoration.</P>
                  <P>(6) If restoration is not waived, and the damages cannot be determined in advance, a provision may be included in the lease to the effect that the rental payments do not include compensation for damages arising from the use of the premises for the purpose leased and that, upon termination of the lease, the damages, mutually determined, will be paid by supplemental agreement to the lease. In event the amount of the loss or damage cannot be mutually determined, the lessor may file a claim for the alleged loss or damage in accordance with subpart H.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Services and utilities.</E> Services, such as janitorial, heat, air conditioning, light and water, should be included in leases for building space wherever possible. Whether services are paid for as part of the rent or by a service contract, the time period for furnishing heat, air conditioning and light, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, usual business hours, 24-hour basis, Saturdays and Sundays, should be clearly stated.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Other contracts.</E> The negotiation and execution of contracts not involving an interest in real estate are the responsibility of the services concerned.<PRTPAGE P="192"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Condition surveys.</E> (1) Whenever possession of any premises is acquired by lease or other agreement, or by condemnation for a term of years, the Division or District Engineer will cause a survey and inspection of the condition of the real and personal property to be made as of the time the Government takes possession.</P>
                  <P>(2) The survey and inspection required above will be made jointly with the lessor or his duly authorized representative. The report will be signed by both parties.</P>
                  <P>(3) The initial survey report must be made with great care since it is the basis for future restoration claims by a lessor. The use of photographs is encouraged. Full explanatory data covering condition of the premises will be added to the report if, in the opinion of the Chief, Real Estate Division, a useful purpose will be served thereby. The survey report of real property, and the inventory and condition report of personal property, will be made with care, as the condition reflected as of the date of initial occupancy will be compared with the condition shown by the terminal reports made upon vacation of premises.</P>
                  <P>(4) A survey is not required of unimproved land where an appraisal has been made and the condition of the land is set forth by the appraiser and made a part of the record.</P>
                  <P>(5) A survey will be made wherever property of another Federal agency is used, with the exception of post offices and Federal buildings. In the event privately-owned buildings, crops, or other property, are on the Federal property, a report will be made outlining the terms and conditions under which they were placed thereon, and the value thereof will be appraised as of the date of possession.</P>
                  <P>(6) Normally, ENG Forms 3143 and 3143A, Joint Survey and Inspection of Condition of Government Leased Property, are adequate for the joint survey and inspection. In certain cases, narrative reports may, at the discretion of the Division or District Engineer, be considered preferable; however, local forms will not be developed for this purpose.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Possession.</E> Possession of real property will not be taken until required approvals and clearances are obtained and a lease is executed. When requested by an appropriate command, rights-of-entry for exploration and survey, or construction, will be obtained in accordance with instructions in §§ 644.155 through 644.157.</P>
                  <P>(l) <E T="03">Condemnation of leaseholds.</E> Where the required leasehold interest cannot be acquired by a negotiated lease, the recommendation of the Division or District Engineer for the institution of condemnation proceedings will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-C) WASH DC 20314, in accordance with § 644.121, setting forth the negotiations that have been conducted with the property owner(s) and all other factors supporting the recommendation.</P>
                  <P>(m) <E T="03">Decease of lessor.</E> (1) Any claim on account of death of a lessor (except uncurrent depository check claims) may be settled without submission to the Chief of Engineers where no doubt exists as to the amount and validity of the claim or as to whom payment may be made under the laws of the domicile of the decedent.</P>
                  <P>(2) Any claim for rent or services due a deceased lessor which is considered doubtful will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314 in accordance with subpart H.</P>
                  <P>(n) <E T="03">Recording leases.</E> If the property is located in a State requiring the recording of leases, all statutory requirements will be met. Leases, and supplemental agreements prior to termination, involving property upon which substantial Government improvements are to be constructed, will be recorded in all cases.</P>
                  <P>(o) <E T="03">Change in ownership.</E> (1) When the title to premises leased to the Government is transferred, the contracting officer shall satisfy himself that the new owner has a valid interest in the premises covered by the lease, and thereafter enter into a supplemental agreement between the old and new owners and the Government, for distribution in the same manner as the original lease.</P>

                  <P>(2) Upon being notified or otherwise determining that a foreclosure proceeding has been filed against the leased premises, or that the enforcement of a deed of trust or mortgage is <PRTPAGE P="193"/>imminent, the Division or District Engineer will take such action as is appropriate under State laws for protection of the United States. This would consist of filing by the United States Attorney with the court, or with the trustee, receiver, or commissioner, as the case might be under local law, of a notice of the Government's lease on the property, with request that the foreclosure proceedings be made subject thereto. If the proceeding is made subject to the lease, an abstract of such proceeding will be made, certified by a staff attorney, and distributed in the same manner as the original lease. If considered advisable, a supplemental agreement to the old lease will be made with the new owner; or a superseding lease may be executed and distributed. If the proceeding results in vesting title in a new owner, free and clear of the Government's lease, attempt will be made to negotiate a new lease; if this fails, condemnation action will be taken sufficiently early to protect the interests of the United States. Negotiation and condemnation in this latter type of situation must be based on a current appraisal.</P>
                  <P>(p) <E T="03">Supplemental agreements.</E> Modification of existing leases will be in the form of supplemental agreements and will be prepared, executed, and distributed in the manner prescribed for the original lease. Where a supplemental agreement provides for an increase in space at an increased rental, the supplemental agreement should contain appropriate recitals of this fact, and provide that the Government, thereafter, may, upon 30 days notice, partially reduce, or discontinue, the use of the space covered by either the supplemental agreement, the basic lease, or both. Supplemental agreements enlarging or reducing space will show the total area and rental comprising the basic lease and preceding supplemental agreements.</P>
                  <P>(q) <E T="03">Annual review of leases.</E> Annual review of leasing requirements and space assignments from GSA are to be initiated by the Division or District Engineer not later than one year before the end of the lease term for each lease.</P>
                  <P>(1) Special attention will be given by Division and District Engineers to leases which expire by their own terms and continued occupancy is required at annual rentals of $50,000 or more. These leases require approval by the Department of Defense and reporting to the Armed Services Committees of the Congress by the Chief of Engineers. An Acquisition Report together with full justification, as set forth in § 644.135(a), in support of each lease (or project covered by more than one lease) must be furnished. For leases in which it is not clear whether Title 10 reporting is required, DAEN-REA-L will be informed of the facts for decision. Attention will be given also to existing leases having annual rentals between $30,000 and $50,000. It is probable that current appraisals will indicate annual rental rates in excess of $50,000 and, therefore, require a title 10 report.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the using command anticipates that there will be further need for the leased property, and the total estimated rentals to be paid by the Government, excluding utilities and services, for the additional period, plus the cost of restoration, will exceed, 50 percent of the estimated current market value of the property, DAEN-REA-L will be informed of all details in order that the review required by paragraph 1-8, AR 405-10, may be made. Only estimated future rent payment is to be considered and not the rental paid in the past for the property. In applying this formula, if the period of future use cannot be ascertained but it is likely that a property will be used for a long period of time, use a period of five years for calculations.</P>
                  <P>(r) <E T="03">Lease renewals and extensions.</E> (1) Lease entered into under authority of the annual appropriation acts may include a provision for automatic renewal after expiration of the initial term subject to the availability of appropriated funds. However, if the property is still needed after lease expiration, a new lease is required and the old lease will not be extended by supplemental agreement for the new term. Where the lease requires notice in writing to be given to the lessor to exercise the option of renewal, notice will be served by the use of ENG Form 221, Notice of Renewal of Contract or Lease, in accordance with the terms of the lease. The notice, properly addressed, <PRTPAGE P="194"/>will be sent by certified mail, with return receipt requested. Adequate time, in addition to the number of days specified in the lease, will be allowed for delivery to, and receipt by, the lessor. The Division or District Engineer will maintain adequate records to assure prompt service of notice to avoid the lapse of leases.</P>
                  <P>(2) No lease will be renewed or kept in existence unless it has been administratively determined, through advertising or otherwise, that other suitable property at a lower rental is not obtainable. At all times, and in particular during the lease renewal review period, the Division or District Engineer will take cognizance of the availability of property in the area of the using service that is Government-owned, or property under GSA control.</P>
                  <P>(s) <E T="03">Payment of rents.</E> (1) One of the most important factors involving good relationships between the Government and the lessor is the prompt payment of the rent. Under existing regulations, the rent is paid by the using commands. The Division or District Engineer makes rental payments for leases when the Corps is the using service and for recruiting facilities, since the Chief of Engineers is the Department of Defense Executive Agent for recruiting facilities acquisition. It is therefore appropriate for the Division or District Engineer to inquire periodically of the using commands whether delays in processing payments are encountered. If payments are not being made within seven working days after payment is due, appropriate action will be taken to correct the delay; if no action is taken after a reasonable time allowed for correction of procedures, DAEN-REA-L will be informed fully of the facts and an investigation will be conducted.</P>

                  <P>(2) Prior to payment, the Division or District Engineer, or his designee, will certify for submission to the Disbursing Officer that the leased property was occupied or available for use. The following certification, contained on Standard Form 1166, Voucher and Schedule for Payments, is used:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>I hereby certify that the leases identified hereon were in effect for the month (or other period) indicated, and that the space was occupied, or available for use, by the Department of the Army.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                </SECTION>
                <SECTION>
                  <SECTNO>§ 644.137</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Maneuver agreements.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Joint training exercises or maneuvers are conducted by elements of the Department of Defense. Land use requirements vary with the exercise objectives and the force elements which participate. The Corps participates in the planning and acquires rights to use land and other facilities for Department of the Army exercises. The current Memorandum of Understanding by Department of the Army, United States Readiness Command (USCINCRED), and United States Army Forces, Readiness Command (USCINCARRED) on acquisition of maneuver rights for United States Readiness Command (USREDCOM) Joint Training exercises is included as Figure 5-13 in ER 405-1-12. This Memorandum covers timing of requests for preliminary surveys, real estate studies, funding and acquisition of maneuver rights. The Corps also responds to requests from other Department of Defense commands for maneuver rights, and the same procedure is envisioned although no Memoranda of Understanding have been entered into. Upon receipt of a request for real estate services, an estimate of the funds required for the report should be forwarded to the using command.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> The appropriate Division or District Engineer will be responsible for negotiating maneuver agreements and short-term leases and, after the maneuver is completed, will be responsible for negotiating restoration settlements and/or releases, as appropriate. Real estate acquisition will be in the form of agreements with landowners, granting the right to conduct maneuvers at a given time, or periodically. Short-term leases for exclusive use may also be acquired for special areas (such as headquarters areas, radio relay sites, base camp sites, field hospital sites and supply dumps), and buildings needed for warehouses, ordnance shops and similar purposes directly related to the maneuver. Permits will be obtained to cover the use of lands under the jurisdiction of another Government department or agency.<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Claims and restoration.</E> Notwithstanding the assignment of restoration responsibility, understanding may be reached with the maneuver director at field level whereby the command will assume responsibility for settlement of real estate damages using claim funds. However, in instances where the damage exceeds the monetary claims jurisdiction of the Army Commander pursuant to AR 27-20 and is cognizable as a contractual obligation under the maneuver permit, settlement will be accomplished by the Division or District Engineer either by supplement to the permit or by processing a claim under AR 405-15 (see § 552.16 of this chapter) since the Division or District Engineer can usually accomplish settlements more quickly for claims in excess of that amount. Therefore, it should be suggested to the maneuver director that all claims, cognizable as a contractual obligation, in excess of his monetary claims jurisdiction be handled by the Division or District Engineer. Funds appropriated for field exercises and maneuvers are allotted to Army Commanders and include administrative costs. The reporting requirements included in Figure 5-13 in ER 405-1-12 will be established by the Chief of Engineers upon receipt of a specific request from the using command to acquire maneuver rights.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Family housing leasing program.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Section 515 of Pub. L. 84-161 (69 Stat. 324), as amended by Pub. L. 95-82, approved 1 Aug 1977, authorizes the expenditure of an average of $280 per month for each military department for housing facilities in the United States (other than Alaska and Hawaii) and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and an average of $350 per month for each military department for housing facilities in Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. In both cases the maximum rental rate per unit per month including utilities, operations and maintenance is $450. These rental figures are subject to change each year in the annual Military Construction Authorization Acts. Updated rental figures should be obtained from the current MCA Act. The Department of Defense allocates to each department of the military the number of units it can acquire pursuant to the authorization, and each year Division and District Engineers are informed of the unit allocations by the Chief of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Leasing requests.</E> The Departments of the Army and Air Force direct their requests for the leasing of family housing units to the Division or District Engineer. Each military element involved has the responsibility of maintaining the national rental average. Each command prescribes the procedures to be followed in acquiring family housing units. Such procedures which include size of accommodations and maximum rental rate will be followed by the Division or District Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of available housing.</E> Priority shall be given to the leasing of adequate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) held units to the extent that such units may be available at locations which are granted lease allocations. FHA Form 2372A, as modified, will be used in leasing FHA housing for use as public quarters by military personnel. A similar form, modified as needed, will be used for VA held housing units.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination provision.</E> All leases for family housing units which are executed on behalf of the United States shall contain the following nondiscrimination clause:

                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>It is understood and agreed that the Government will assign the demised premises to military personnel in accordance with Executive Order 11063, dated 20 November 1962, which provides that housing and related facilities shall be available without discrimination among tenants because of race, color, creed, sex or national origin.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Pest control.</E> In agreement with the lessor, whenever possible, the lessor will affirmatively assume responsibility for pest control in family housing units. The following clause will be included in family housing leases:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>It is understood and agreed that the lessor will be responsible to provide pest control measures and pesticides, which conform to local health department regulations, to keep the premises free from pests and in a tenantable condition.</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  

                  <FP>It is intended that the occupant will maintain the leased premises in a clean and sanitary condition in conformance <PRTPAGE P="196"/>with normal standards of good housekeeping, and that the lessor will furnish leased housing in pest-free condition and maintain the premises free of pest infestation.</FP>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Leasing actions.</E> (1) Division and District Engineers will proceed with acquiring the family housing units within the framework of the leasing requests. Care is to be taken to assure that there are no violations of the Economy Act, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the net rental will not exceed 15 percent of the estimated fee value of the space or building contemplated for leasing.</P>
                  <P>(2) At the discretion of the Division or District Engineer and the Chief of the Real Estate Division, Standard Form 2B may be used for family housing leases, regardless of the rental rate.</P>
                  <P>(3) Emergency repairs may be accomplished in accordance with § 644.135(f)(5).</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Supplemental payments.</E> All leases for family housing units which are executed on behalf of the United States shall contain the following clause prohibiting supplemental payments: “The Lessor hereby agrees that the rental consideration specified herein is the only consideration to be received for the demised premises and includes payment for all utilities, maintenance and services specified herein. No other remuneration will be paid by the Government's occupant, members of his family, or any other person on their behalf.”</P>

                  <P>Division and District Engineers and the Chiefs of the Real Estate Division are authorized to execute leases, and renewals of leases, for river and harbor or flood control purposes, subject to necessary approvals and clearances. The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2662, which require reporting of certain leases proposals to the Armed Services Committees of the Congress, do not apply to leases for civil works.</P>

                  <P>(2) Where the leasing involved is for space for both military and civil functions, and the rental for the portion used for military purposes is in excess of $50,000. The report required is covered in § 644.135(a).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Records.</E> The originals of leases for civil works purposes, together with supporting data, will be retained at the Division or District Engineer offices for site audit in accordance with Section 7530, “General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies.”</P>

                  <P>It is essential that the Division or District Engineer make provision for the physical protection for all facilities under Corps control. Coordination with state, county, and city law enforcement officials as well as the U.S. Attorney's Office is required. These officials should be alerted at the first indication of possible disturbances. The U.S. Attorney's Office should be provided with an up-to-date list of the locations of such facilities.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Self-protection plan.</E> Space or property controlled by GSA is the responsibility of GSA for physical protection. In accordance with 41 CFR 101-20.504, a Facility Self-Protection Plan is to be established by agencies in GSA-controlled space. This requirement should be coordinated with appropriate GSA Regional personnel. A similar plan should be made operational, where feasible, in other space over which the Corps has responsibility.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Funding.</E> Space under GSA control may require protection and the GSA Regional Offices may not have funds. In these situations, the facts will be made known to DAEN-REA-L, accompanied by a request for funds. Likewise, for Corps leases, funds for physical protection shall be requested from DAEN-REP if they are not already available to the Division or District Engineer.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Division and District Engineers will be available to the military elements for consultation and review of requirements involving construction on leased land or in leased <PRTPAGE P="197"/>space. Detailed instructions are furnished in DOD Directives 4165.12, 4165.16, 4165.20, 4270.24, 5160.58, 7040.2; DOD Instruction 5305.5; Army Regulations 140-485, 405-10, 415-25, 415-35, 420-10. Section 644.135(b) covers the requirements of the Economy Act which are applicable to alterations and construction on leased real property. The work to be performed must be essential. Guidelines are furnished as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) The proposed alterations and improvements must be advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, and, where applicable, to national security.</P>
                  <P>(2) For office space, the cost should be less than the cost of other space that is available and which does not require alterations or improvements to any appreciable extent.</P>
                  <P>(3) Due regard is to be given to the convenience of the public that is served and the maintenance and improvement of safe and healthful working conditions of employees.</P>
                  <P>(4) Where the proposed temporary construction at a leased facility has an estimated cost equal to or in excess of the current market value of the property, the facts will be reported promptly to DAEN-REA-L.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial and subsequent alterations.</E> (1) Initial alterations to facilities leased by the Corps are the responsibility of the appropriate Division or District Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(2) Effort will be made to include all required alterations in the rental package with the lessor performing all of the work. Careful attention will be given to possible violations of the Economy Act. Payment for initial alterations may be in a lump sum or by the month with the rent, provided the provisions of the Economy Act are complied with and the alterations costs are stated separately in the file or in the voucher.</P>
                  <P>(3) Alterations or improvements of any nature in GSA furnished space are the responsibility of GSA. Under certain circumstances, GSA may require a Certificate of Necessity in order to perform the required construction.</P>
                  <P>(4) Although alterations and improvements subsequent to occupancy are not the responsibility of the Corps, the Division or District Engineer should always review subsequent alteration projects to determine whether or not the limitations of the Economy Act are applicable. See AR 415-34, AR 415-35, and AR 420-10 for procedures and instructions.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Army National Guard.</E> No initial alterations regardless of cost will be made to properties leased for the Army National Guard without prior approval of the Chief, National Guard Bureau. (Funds will be made available by the National Guard Bureau.)</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Air Force.</E> All alterations to premises leased for the Department of the Air Force, including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Units, are the responsibility of that Department including the issuance of any Certificate of Necessity for Department of Air Force elements. The only exception is the leasing and modification of leased premises for recruiting facilities.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Recruiting facilities.</E> The Chief of Engineers, as the Department of Defense Executive Agent for recruiting facilities, is responsible for initial alterations for all recruiting facilities located on military reservations or leased by the Corps. This responsibility includes recruiting offices and recruiting main stations and detachments, whether single-service or collocated. However, as to recruiting facilities acquired by GSA, all alterations are the responsibility of GSA and processing is accomplished through the Division or District Engineer.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Permanent construction requirements.</E> If permanent construction is to be placed on land, the Government must have fee title or acquire title to the land or a permanent easement must be secured, with the following exceptions:</P>
                  <P>(1) Real property, including land or buildings, which the Government currently holds the right to reuse by exercise of the National Security Clause.</P>
                  <P>(2) Real property, including land or buildings, which the Government holds the right to reuse by exercise of a National Emergency Use Provision.</P>

                  <FP>Since such rights apply only during the period or periods of national emergency and are extinguished by the termination thereof, every effort will be made to negotiate a lease covering <PRTPAGE P="198"/>such property under terms that would provide the Government the right of continuous possession for a minimum of 25 years.</FP>
                  <P>(3) Real property required for installation of utility lines and necessary appurtenances thereto, provided a long-term easement or lease can be secured at a consideration of $1.00 per term or per annum.</P>
                  <P>(4) Real property required for air bases, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions for:</P>
                  <P>(i) Right of continuous use by the Government under firm term or right of renewal for a minimum of 50 years.</P>
                  <P>(ii) A rental consideration of $1.00 per term or per annum.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Reserving to the Government, title to all improvements to be placed on the land and the right to dispose of such improvements by sale or abandonment.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Waiver by the lessor of any and all claims for restoration of the leased premises.</P>
                  <P>(v) Use of the property for “Government purposes” rather than for a specific military purpose.</P>
                  <P>(5) Property required for facilities for the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions detailed in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Whenever possible, the insertion in a lease of a provision restricting the use of land to a specific purpose will be avoided; use a term such as “Government purposes”.</P>
                  <P>(6) Property required for air defense sites, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section and the right of continuous use by the Government under a firm term or right of renewal for as long as required for defense purposes.</P>
                  <P>(7) Assistant Secretary of Defense (MRA&amp;L) approval is required when leases for air bases, Reserve Components facilities, or air defense sites can be obtained containing some but not all of the above listed provisions. Such approval is also required for leases for all other types of installations upon which permanent construction is to be placed by the Government when leases can be obtained containing similar provisions. In all cases, it must be in the best interest of the Government to acquire a lesser interest than fee title.</P>
                  <P>(8) Construction projects estimated to cost less than $25,000 will not be considered a permanent construction for purposes of the above policy.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">GSA reimbursement.</E> Reimbursement to GSA for Standard Level User Charges (SLUC) and other costs incident to leasing will be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Federal Property Management Regulation.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Nominal rent leases.</E> (1) Where premises are occupied by the Government at a nominal rent or rent-free basis, any alterations, improvements, and repairs necessary for occupancy may be considered as a cost of occupancy, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, in lieu of rent, for each year of the rental term. However, the total cost of such alterations, improvements, and repairs, plus the nominal rental, during any year of the rental term may not exceed 15 percent of the fair market value at the date of the lease, unless the total cost plus nominal rental does not exceed $2,000 per annum.</P>
                  <P>(2) When rental plus amounts to be spent by the Government for alterations, improvements, and repairs total more than $2,000 and more than 15 percent of the fair market value of the premises at the date of the lease, a Certificate of Necessity is required.</P>
                  <P>(3) A Certificate of Necessity is not required for the cost of installing equipment, apparatus, appliances, machinery, fixtures, movable partitions, etc., which are not intended to become an integral part of the building and which may be removed without injuring or defacing the item or the building. Such property is considered to be the property of the Government. The lease or a supplement thereto should provide for the installation and removal of such equipment, etc.</P>

                  <P>(4) Under the limitations in 40 U.S.C. 278a, not more than 25 percent of the net rental for the original lease period, if less than one year, may be expended before a lease is actually renewed. If the whole period, including renewals, is less than a year, not more than 25 percent of the rent for such whole period may be expended for alterations, repairs, and improvements (20 Comp. <PRTPAGE P="199"/>Gen. 30; 29 Comp. Gen. 299). Where a lease, entered into by the Government for an original term of less than a year, is renewed for the following fiscal year, the net rental for the first year of the rental term, as distinguished from the original term, is for consideration in the computation of the amount that may be paid under the 25 percent limitation, after the lease is actually renewed.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Items not within the purview of the Economy Act.</E> (1) The limitations in 40 U.S.C. 278a are not applicable to leases of unimproved land (38 Comp. Gen. 143).</P>
                  <P>(2) Where fixtures, alterations, and improvements are of such characters to be of a temporary nature, and are not permanently attached to the realty so as to prevent removal thereof without destroying their usefulness or damaging them or the realty, they do not constitute alterations or improvements of the leased premises within the meaning of 40 U.S.C. 278a and therefore do not fall within the 25 percent limitation of that Act. Title to such temporary fixtures, alterations, and improvements remains in the Government (18 Comp. Gen. 144; 20 Comp. Gen. 105).</P>
                  <P>(3) Upon termination of leases, restoration of leased premises to the original condition is not considered an alteration within the purview of 40 U.S.C. 278a.</P>
                  <P>(4) When the Government is required by the terms of the lease to maintain the leased premises, such maintenance, together with the cost of such improvements and alterations as may be made by the Government, may not exceed the 25 percent restriction of the Act.</P>
                  <P>(5) Leaseholds acquired through condemnation proceedings are excluded from the purview of the Act of 30 June 1932, as amended (40 U.S.C. 278a).</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Architectural Barriers Act.</E> The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-480), 82 Stat. 718, 142 U.S.C. 4151, <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended, requires that when Federal funding is used in the design, construction, or alteration of certain buildings or facilities, the buildings or facilities must be designed, constructed or altered to insure that physically handicapped persons will have ready access to, and use of, such buildings. In the Corps' leasing program, when Federal funds are used to make improvements to leased premises, it is necessary that the plans and specifications for the construction or alteration work be approved in accordance with guidelines published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), as implemented by DOD Construction Criteria Manual 4270.1-M, Section 5-1.6.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Lease forms and instructions.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>ENG Form 856 will be used for Corps of Engineers leases in the United States and possessions, and overseas, for the leasing of unimproved land. ENG Form 527 is recommended for leases of improved property in overseas areas. Standard Forms 2, 2A, or 2B (short form) will be used for all Corps of Engineers leases of improved property in the United States and possessions. Standard Form 2B is limited to rentals not exceeding $3,600 per annum. The General Provisions are on the reverse side of the short form lease.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Mandatory clauses.</E> The following clauses must be included in all Corps of Engineers leases:</P>
                  <P>(1) Officials Not to Benefit clause (para 15 of ENG Form 527) is required by 18 U.S.C. 431.</P>
                  <P>(2) Gratuities clause (para 16a of ENG Form 527) is required by 5 U.S.C. 174d.</P>
                  <P>(3) Covenant against Contingent Fees (para 14, ENG Form 527) is required by 10 U.S.C. 2306(b).</P>
                  <P>(4) An Examination of Records clause (para 17, ENG Form 527) is required by 10 U.S.C. 2313(b). Exceptions to the use of this clause in 10 U.S.C. 2313(c) are permitted when the contractor is a foreign Government or agency thereof, or when the laws of the country involved preclude it. Also, if the Head of the Agency determines, with the concurrence of the Comptroller General, that the use of the clause would not be in the public interest, it may be omitted in leases covering land in foreign countries.</P>
                  <P>(5) The Nondiscrimination clause (Executive Order 11063, dated 20 November 1962) is required in all leases in the United States. It is desirable, but is not considered mandatory in overseas leases.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Hold harmless clauses.</E> “Hold harmless” clause will not normally be added to the lease forms. Where lessors insist <PRTPAGE P="200"/>upon such a clause, however, the following is suggested for use: “The Lessors (licensors) shall not be responsible or liable for injuries to persons or damage to property when such injuries or damage are caused by or result from the Government's use of the premises under the terms of this agreement and are not due to the negligence of the Lessors.”</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Escalator clauses.</E> In those cases where a lessor expresses an unwillingness to enter into a lease, extending for a number of years, with a rental consideration that includes a fixed amount for utilities, the following clause may be inserted in the standard lease:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>After the first term of the lease, the Lessor or the Government may, by giving notice at lease 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the lease, request an adjustment in rental payments based on an increase or decrease in the cost of utilities. The request must be supported with full justification to include documentary evidence of actual utility costs incurred by the Lessor which are in excess of the amounts estimated at the beginning of the lease term. The requested adjustment in rent will be subject to negotiation, and if granted, will be provided by a Supplemental Agreement to this lease.</P>

                  <P>Sections 644.155 through 644.157 describe the procedures of the Corps of Engineers relative to obtaining rights-of-entry on lands for both military and civil works projects and in the Corps' acquisition programs for other Federal Government agencies.

                  <P>A right-of-entry is a bare authority to do a specified act or series of acts upon non-Government-owned property or non-Government-controlled property without acquiring any estate or interest therein. The principal effect of a right-of-entry is to authorize an act which, in the absence of the right-of-entry, would constitute a trespass. The written instrument furnishes evidence of the permission granted to the government and the obligations, responsibilities, and liabilities assumed by the Government. It does not authorize any uses of the property by the Government other than those specified in the instrument.</P>

                  <P>(a) ENG Form 1258, Right-of-Entry for Survey and Exploration, will be used to obtain authority from the owner of lands to be used for the purpose of making surveys, test borings, and other exploratory work as may be necessary to complete the particular investigation.</P>
                  <P>(b) ENG Form 2803, Right-of-Entry for Construction, will be used to obtain authority from the owner of lands to be used for construction purposes when all of the following conditions apply:</P>
                  <P>(1) A Real Estate Directive has been issued on an Army (military) or Air Force project, or the Chief of Engineers has approved acquisition in connection with a civil works project or for another Government agency.</P>
                  <P>(2) The construction schedule does not allow sufficient time to secure the right of possession by normal acquisition procedures.</P>
                  <P>(c) Upon execution of an ENG Form 2803, a copy thereof shall be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314 on Army Military and Air Force acquisitions, and in all other cases to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314, together with a proposed schedule of final acquisition of the necessary interests in real estate. If final acquisition is not contemplated within six months from the date of the right-of-entry, an explanation should also be furnished as to the reason for the delay.</P>
                  <P>(d) Division and District Engineers may modify ENG Forms 1258 and 2803, where necessary, to meet requirements of landowners, provided such modifications do not increase the scope of the liability or responsibility of the Government over that contained in the standard forms.</P>

                  <P>(e) It is necessary to recognize not only the effects of entry upon a particular parcel of land, but also the effects of the passage of any vehicle <PRTPAGE P="201"/>(land, air, or water) on the area traversed. All possibilities of disturbing effects on the countryside shall be considered and routes selected to eliminate or minimize such disturbances.</P>
                  <P>(f) Any cash settlements in lieu of restoration for damages, incurred under ENG Forms 1258 and 2803, will be consummated by supplemental agreement in accordance with subpart I.</P>

                  <P>(1) The Secretary of a military department may acquire an option on a parcel of real property before or after its acquisition is authorized by law, if he considers it suitable and likely to be needed for a military project of his department.</P>
                  <P>(2) As consideration for an option so acquired, the Secretary may pay from funds available to his department for real property activities, an amount that is not more than five percent of the appraised fair market value of the property.</P>
                  <P>(3) For each six-month period ending on June 30 or December 31, during which he acquires options under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary of each military department shall report those options to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) Where land is needed for proposed construction and the siting of said construction is firm.</P>
                  <P>(2) When there is a definite indication of material enhancement in value due to change, or proposed change, in use by the land owner, price increase due to publicity given to contemplated Government acquisition, or abnormal increases in market value.</P>
                  <P>(3) Where there is a definite possibility of private construction which would constitute obstructions in existing or proposed glide angle planes and transitional planes at air bases.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Implementation.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>When a District or Division Engineer determines that any of the conditions described in § 644.166(b) exist in connection with any proposed land acquisition project for military purposes not yet authorized by law, or if authorized, not yet covered by a real estate directive, he will initiate the following actions:</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Planning report.</E> A planning report will be developed and submitted in accordance with subpart A. The report will include the purpose for which the property is “likely to be needed”; the estimated probable increase in value, if applicable; and the justification for negotiating for options under the authority cited in § 644.166. The report will identify any real estate planning reports previously prepared which included the land in question. Any future planning reports relating to the same land will contain appropriate references to this report.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Property identification.</E> Upon receipt of authority to acquire options and determination that funds are available, the District or Division Engineer will obtain and verify ownership data. If it is deemed necessary, title evidence may be obtained in accordance with §§ 644.61 through 644.72.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisal.</E> Detailed tract appraisals will be prepared in accordance with subpart B.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Procurement of options.</E> (1) Negotiations for the option will be in accordance with procedures outlined in §§ 644.83 through 644.85, except that ENG Form 2926, Option to Purchase <PRTPAGE P="202"/>Real Property, will be used. An attempt should be made to include a provision in the option giving the Government the right to acquire all or part of the land covered by the option where the land held in a single ownership can be separated into definable parcels and the possibility exists that, as planning is developed, the entire tract will not be required.</P>
                  <P>(2) The following instructions for the use of ENG Form 2926 will be followed:</P>
                  <P>(i) Insert amount to be paid for the option privilege. This amount cannot exceed five percent of the appraised value.</P>
                  <P>(ii) If the land has been separated into definable parcels in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the option should describe each parcel and provide for a separate purchase price inclusive of any severance damage, as well as an agreed purchase price for the entire tract. The amount to be paid for the option privilege will be apportioned among the separate parcels.</P>
                  <P>(iii) The expiration date of the option on unauthorized projects should be far enough in advance to permit the insertion of a land acquisition line item in the next available budget; enactment of legislation; apportionment of funds by the Office of Management and Budget; clearance within the Department of Defense; clearance with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, if required; issuance of a real estate directive; and allotment of funds.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Since options obtained under this section will normally be recorded, ENG Form 2926 will be acknowledged in the form used in the jurisdiction in which the real property is located.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Report.</E> When all options within the approval area have been acquired, and prior to their being exercised by the Government, a report will be made to HQDA (DAEN-REA-L) WASH DC 20314 including, but not limited to, the following items:</P>
                  <P>(1) Project identification.</P>

                <P>The major portion of real property disposal actions performed by the Corps of Engineers is predicated on authority derived from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 471, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), hereinafter referred to as the Federal Property Act, and the rules, regulations and delegations of authority issued by the General Services Administration (GSA) thereunder. Other authorities relating to the disposal of military real property are found in AR 405-90. The Army and Air Force Basic <PRTPAGE P="203"/>Real Estate Agreements covering disposal of Air Force real estate are found in AR 405-5 and AFR 87-15.</P>

                <P>Under the rules, regulations and delegations of authority issued by GSA under the Federal Property Act, the military departments are authorized to dispose of the following:</P>
                <P>(a) Real property under its control (except land withdrawn or reserved from the public domain), together with the improvements thereon and related personal property, which has a value of less than $1,000.</P>
                <P>(b) Leases, permits, licenses, easements, or similar interests, including Government-owned improvements on the premises, unless it is determined that the interest should be included with the disposal of other property being reported to GSA for disposal.</P>
                <P>(c) Fixtures, structures, and improvements of any kind to be disposed of without the underlying land.</P>
                <P>(d) Standing timber and embedded gravel, sand, and stone to be disposed of without the underlying land.</P>

                <P>Consistent with the best interest of the United States and with applicable laws and regulations, the following priorities should be followed in disposing of real property no longer needed by the Departments of the Army and Air Force:</P>
                <P>(a) Transfer to other Department of Defense agencies and the U.S. Coast Guard.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Environmental considerations.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) directs that a five point Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) be prepared, circulated among interested Federal, State and local agencies, and filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before a major Federal action is taken which affects the quality of the human environment. This may include some disposals. No major disposal action will be undertaken where the Corps of Engineers is the disposal agency, or is acting for the disposal agency, until the required EIS has be submitted to the EPA unless a “Finding of No Significant Impact” (FONSI) has been prepared for the action, or if the action is classified as a “categorically excluded” item because it has no significant effect on the environment. The Environmental Assessment is subject to review and approval in accordance with instructions found in AR 200-1 and AR 200-2 (to be printed) for military real property disposal, and the forthcoming Engineer Regulation for civil works real property disposal. Where property is reported to GSA for disposal, GSA is responsible for compliance with NEPA.</P>

                <P>Purposes of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 470) and Executive Order 11593, Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment (13 May 1971) will be set forth in subpart H (to be published) and the authorities there cited also apply to the disposal of real property. Specific policy guidance in connection with disposals having historic significance is published in AR 200-1 and AR 405-90 for military real properties and in ER 1105-2-460 for civil works real properties.</P>
                <P>(a) The Criteria of Adverse Effect on eligible properties may occur under conditions which include but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Destruction or alteration of all or part of a property.</P>
                <P>(2) Isolation from or alteration of the property's surrounding environment.</P>
                <P>(3) Transfer or sale of a property without adequate conditions or restrictions regarding preservation, maintenance, or use.</P>

                <P>(b) It is normally intended that the agency responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act of 1966 and Executive Order 11593 run concurrently with the NEPA review process. However, obligations pursuant thereto are independent from <PRTPAGE P="204"/>NEPA requirements and must be complied with even when an environmental impact statement is not required.</P>

This does not include civil works housing, or houses on land acquired for military purposes unless the housing was specifically acquired to house military personnel. This means that excess military family housing and related land and improvements should be reported to GSA on Standard Form 118 separate and apart from Reports of Excess for other portions of an excess installation. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the following statement be included in each such report of excess to GSA:

Buildings or other improvements, including timber, which are on nonexcess land come within the purview of this law. Where both land and buildings or other improvements are excess, proceeds from the sale of land and buildings, or either one, will be deposited in the land and water conservation fund as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(i) A brief description of the character or nature of the land with an appropriately marked map showing the approximate acreage consideration to be excess. Detailed perimeter descriptions need not be procured or furnished with the report and recommendation for excessing.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Description of buildings and improvements.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Information as to circumstances that might hinder or prevent disposition, e.g. remoteness of location, unfavorable topography, and lack of legal access.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Information as to when and how the property was acquired.</P>

                  <P>(v) Information as to the estate which the Government has in the land, reservations and exceptions in and to the Government's title, and outstanding interests granted by the Government or reserved or excepted in the acquisition of the land, will be stated with particularity. The map or plat will delineate any grant, exception or <PRTPAGE P="206"/>reservation, such as telephone, telegraph, electric transmission, oil, gas, and water lines.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Purchase price of lands (estimate if only a portion of original tract), buildings and improvements acquired with the lands, and the cost of buildings and improvements, if any, constructed by the United States.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Screening for defense needs.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Real property which becomes excess to the needs of any element of the Army or Air Force will be screened against requirements of other Department of Defense (DOD) agencies and the U.S. Coast Guard in order to promote and obtain the most efficient and complete utilization of real property before disposing of it.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure for screening Army military property.</E> Screening for defense requirements with respect to base closures publicly announced by the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of the Army which result in excessing of real property will not be accomplished unless directed by HQDA (DAEN-ZCI) Washington DC 20314. Instructions to screen will be included in the disposal directive transmitted to the DE when such action is desired. In the absence of such instructions, it is presumed that DOD has negatively evaluated all possible requirements of DOD agencies before making the public announcement.</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Fee-owned land.</E> Screening is required in all other cases unless specifically directed otherwise. Property will be screened simultaneously against other Army requirements, and for Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Defense agency requirements. The property should also be screened against known Department of the Army Civil Works requirements.</P>
                  <P>(i) The DE will dispatch a screening message promptly upon receipt of an excess directive or recommendation pursuant to AR 405-90. The sample screening message in ER 405-1-12 at Figure 11-1, or a letter similar in form and content will be used without substantial deviation.</P>
                  <P>(ii) All action addressees and parties listed for information on Figure 11-1 in ER 405-1-12 will be included, except that Air Force real property in Hawaii will be screened with the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Air Forces, in lieu of HQ, USAF. The appropriate major Army command, when not the using command, will be listed as an action addressee.</P>
                  <P>(iii) In no case will screening be deferred unless authorized by DAEN-REM. At the expiration of the screening period (normally 30 days) a report of results will be forwarded and subsequent action initiated as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(iv) For certain cases, most frequently in connection with base realignments or Executive Order 11954 surveys, accelerated screening procedures are set out in AR 405-90.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Capehart and Wherry Housing Projects.</E> Due to the complicated financial arrangements under which such projects are constructed and operated, the disposal thereof, whether separately or as a part of a larger installation, requires careful study. In order to assure maximum time in which to discover and evaluate problems arising in each of such cases, the DE will notify HQDA (DAEN-REM) Washington DC 20314, by teletype, immediately upon receipt of information of an installation commander's recommendation of <PRTPAGE P="207"/>excess involving Capehart and acquired Wherry housing projects. Included with this notice will be advice on the source of utilities and any problems of which the DE may be aware.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Leaseholds, buildings and improvements.</E> Leaseholds, buildings, and other improvements will not be screened formally within the Department of the Army (DA). When such property is made available or disposal under AR 405-90 and §§ 644.326 through 644.329, it will be screened by the responsible DE with the Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy and against known Army military and civil works requirements within the Division. Screening with the Air Force of leaseholds having an annual rental in excess of $50,000 will be addressed to HQ, USAF. Other Air Force screening under this subparagraph will be with local Air Force installations. Screening with the Navy will be addressed to the appropriate naval district. Screening with the Coast Guard and Defense agencies will be with the local representatives of those agencies. Property under the jurisdiction of GSA which has been assigned to the DA or Department of the Air Force (DAF) for use is not subject to this screening procedure, but the DE will determine whether such property would serve any current unfulfilled real property acquisition directives pending in his office.</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Family housing leases.</E> Family housing leases under authority of Section 515, Pub. L. 84-161, 69 Stat. 352, as amended and extended, will be terminated promptly upon determination that the property is excess to the needs of the using command, without screening for other requirements.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Limit screening.</E> Screening which would serve no useful purpose is to be avoided. Screening of buildings and improvements on sites needed for approved construction should be limited as construction schedules require. The DE will take timely action to minimize additional cost and rental payments due to screening and may, at his discretion, limit screening of leaseholds and improvements to be removed from the site to informal notices to appropriate local Defense agencies. The DEs are authorized to waive screening of nonassignable or short term interests in real property when such screening would serve no useful purpose.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of restoration requirements.</E> All screening notices of leaseholds and improvements available for off-site removal will indicate that transferees will be required to perform necessary site restoration as a prerequisite to obtaining transfer and will reflect the extent of restoration required.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure for screening civil works property.</E> Buildings and improvements, leaseholds, and fee-owned land that have been determined excess to civil works requirements in accordance with this part will be screened with the appropriate major Army and local service commanders, and with the Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Defense agencies. (GSA property assigned to the Army for use is not subject to formal screening hereunder but will be screened against known acquisition directives or requirements in the DE office.) Except to the extent that DEs determine they are inappropriate, screening procedures for civil works property will be the same as for Army military property.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Screening of Air Force property.</E> HQ, USAF and the major Air Force commands screen Air Force real property before authorizing disposal action by the Corps of Engineers in accordance with AFR 87-4. DEs will act on requests for disposal action on buildings and improvements and leased property received directly from major Air Force commands which conform with AFR 87-4. Disposal directives on fee-owned land and easements will be issued by HQ, USAF and referred through DAEN-REM.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Report on screening and related actions.</E> Immediately following the screening of fee-owned land, the DE will forward to DAEN-REM a report of the results of the screening (with comments and recommendations where a further Army or other Defense requirement is indicated). This report will serve as one of the basis of a determination whether the property is excess to the rquirements of the DOD. Upon dispatch of the screening report, the DE will proceed with further action pursuant to §§ 644.340 through 644.347 and §§ 644.385 through 644.389. No report on screening of civil works property is <PRTPAGE P="208"/>required unless there is a request for transfer or reassignment of the property screened.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Property with an estimated value of $50,000 or less.</E> If the property has an estimated value of $50,000 or less, the determination that the property is excess to Army requirements will be made by the Department of the Army without referral to DOD, and the Chief of Engineers will direct the DE accordingly. Upon receipt of this disposal directive, prompt action will be taken to report the property to GSA or take other disposal action as appropriate.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Estimated value in excess of $50,000.</E> If military property has an estimated value in excess of $50,000, it must be reported to the Armed Services Committees of Congress pursuant to title 10, United States Code, section 2662. The final Army determination of excess and recommendations to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (MRA&amp;L) to approve the proposed disposal report to the Armed Services Committees by the Chief of Engineers, utilizing Real Estate Disposal Report, ENG Form 2187R, are combined in a single action. The Chief of Engineers will advise of DOD approval of the proposed disposal when made. Upon receipt of this information responsible Division and District Engineers will furnish GSA a preliminary report of excess. The preliminary report of excess will be finalized, upon receipt of instructions from the Chief of Engineers. This procedure is also applicable to Air Force disposals. If the preliminary report of excess is sufficiently complete and accurate, it may be finalized by letter or simple statement on Standard Form 118, Report of Excess Real Property.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Date of excess for reporting purposes.</E> From the above, it will be noted that where property has an estimated value in excess of $100,000, the determination that the property is excess to the requirements of the Department of the Army is, in effect, made concurrently with the determination that the property is excess to the requirements of the DOD, or is approved for transfer to another military department. For all practical purposes, these determinations are best evidenced by the Assistant Secretary of Defense's approval of the proposed disposal. The date of approval may be used as the date the property was determined excess to Army requirements for reporting purposes.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Screening by GSA.</E> (1) GSA will screen all excess real property reported to it for disposal, to determine whether the property is surplus to all Federal agencies.</P>
                  <P>(2) GSA will screen certain classes of excess real property which must be reported to it for screening, even though the Department of the Army will act as the disposal agency (§§ 644.348 through 644.367).</P>
                  <P>(3) Under the FPMR, Federal agencies are allowed 30 days to advise whether there is a tentative or firm requirement and another 30 days to determine and advise whether the tentative requirement is firm. Where there is a firm requirement, agencies are allowed an additional 60 days to prepare and submit a formal request for transfer pursuant to FPMR Section 101-47.203-7.

Screening of such properties will be limited to agencies that maintain local offices and may be done on an informal basis. The DE may waive screening of nonassignable and short term interests in real property when they determine such screening will serve no useful purpose. When screening discloses no requirement, the property will be determined surplus and disposed of.</P>

                  <P>(a) Fee-owned land, including withdrawn or reserved public domain land which BLM made available for disposal under Federal Property Act, together with the Government-owned improvements and related personal property, having an estimated fair market value of less than $1,000 in the opinion of the responsible DE;</P>

                  <P>(b) Excess non-Government-owned property held under lease, license, easement, or similar instrument, when <PRTPAGE P="213"/>Government-owned improvements with related personal property have a net salvage value of less than $1,000 or are to be transferred to the owner of the land in restoration settlement, and;</P>
                  <P>(1) The lease or similar instrument is subject to termination by the grantor of the premises within nine months; or</P>
                  <P>(2) The remaining term of the lease or similar instrument, including renewal rights, will provide for less than nine months of use and occupancy; or</P>
                  <P>(3) A provision of the lease or similar instrument would preclude transfer to another Federal agency or disposal to a third party; or</P>
                  <P>(4) The lease or similar instrument provides for use and occupany of space for office, storage, and related facilities, which does not exceed a total of 2,500 square feet; or</P>
                  <P>(5) Where additional rental would be incurred.</P>
                  <P>(c) Excess Government-owned improvements on nonexcess land, which improvements, in the opinion of the responsible DE, have a net salvage value of less that $1,000.</P>
                  <P>(d) Leased space assigned by GSA, and land and improvements owned by and permitted from other Government agencies.</P>
                  <P>(e) Excess timber, sand, gravel and stone-quarried products, and growing crops on nonexcess land regardless of value.</P>
                  <P>(f) Excess withdrawn or reserved public domain lands, regardless of value, which are offered to and accepted by the Department of the Interior for return to the public domain pursuant to §§ 644.376 through 644.384.</P>
                  <P>(g) Prefabricated movable structures, such as Butler-type storage warehouses and quonset huts, and housetrailers (with or without undercarriages), which are located on nonexcess land for off-site use. These types of structures shall be reported as personal property in accordance with FPMR, part 101-43, Utilization of Personal Property. However, when such structures are located on leased or permitted land subjecting the Department to any restoration obligations, the property will be treated as real property for the purpose of satisfying such obligations to the maximum extent feasible.</P>

                  <P>Pursuant to Executive Order 11296, 10 August 1966, the DE having civil works responsibility for the area where property proposed for disposal is located will evaluate the property (civil or military) for the presence of flood hazards. If such hazards are found, a report will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REM) recommending appropriate restrictions with respect to future uses of the property, or that the property be withheld from disposal. If decision is made to proceed with disposal, detailed information regarding the flood hazard will be reported to GSA on SF 118 as required by FPMR, 101-47.202-2, with the appropriate restrictions with respect to use of the property by a purchaser and his successors.

                  <P>As an exception to its general policy, GSA has agreed with the Department of Defense to accept reports of excess on some facilities with instructions on their disposal, specifically:</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Defense Industrial Reserve (DIR).</E> The Defense Industrial Reserve Act 50 U.S.C. 451 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> authorizes the Secretary of Defense to determine which excess industrial properties should become a part of DIR and to formulate a national security clause or recapture provisions to preserve the production capacity of the plants for use in the event of a national emergency. Excess DIR plants are reported to GSA for disposal subject to the national security clause or the recapture provisions. (See FPMR Subsection 101-47.306-2 for procedures where GSA is unable to dispose <PRTPAGE P="214"/>of the property because of the restrictions imposed by the national security clause or recapture provisions.)</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Reserving property for civil defense purposes.</E> GSA has agreed to accept reports of excess of missile sites and other facilities having similar protective features, with restrictions on their disposal. DEs will be notified when DOD advises that a specified local government unit is interested in acquiring such property. Reports of excess will specify the local government unit interested. Disposal of the property will be limited to conveyance to the local government unit, with conditions restricting its use to civil defense purposes for a period of 20 years, with reverter to the United States for breach of condition. In appropriate cases, GSA will enter into a temporary lease arrangement if necessary to afford a local government unit an opportunity to obtain the necessary funds for purchase. This procedure is limited to cases where DOD has determined and advised there is a civil defense need. Disposal action will not be delayed pending receipt of such advise.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Preparation</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Reports of excess will be prepared on SF 118, with schedules, in accordance with the instructions contained in FPMR section 101-47.4902, and § 644.349 herein. However, since the type of information called for a Block 9 of standard form (SF) 118 and Columns f, g, h, and i of schedule A is not generally applicable to camps, airfields, etc., such information will be furnished only when it is available and can be furnished without additional cost. Reports of excess will include all related or appurtenant easements, licenses, and related personal property. Decontamination data will be included as prescribed in §§ 644.516 through 644.539. Information on flood hazard will be included as required by § 644.352.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">GSA regulations.</E> Pursuant to GSA regulations, all final reports of excess will be made only after the property has been determined excess to the needs of the Department of Defense and will bear the statement: “This property has been screened against the known defense needs of the Department of Defense.” Report of excess will indicate that the provisions of title 10, United States Code, section 2662, requiring reports to the Armed Services Committees of Congress, have been met, or that the report of excess is not subject to this section.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Reports of excess—Air Force property.</E> The Air Force will prepare SF 118, with Schedules A and C, and transmit them to the DE for completion and execution. Land descriptions, title reports, and other data required by the FPMR will be the responsibility of the DE.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Reports of excess—Army property.</E> DEs will prepare the SF 118 and the schedules for excess Army property.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission.</E> Reports of excess will be transmitted directly by the DE to the appropriate regional office of GSA. Each DE making such reports of excess will assign a number in Block 1 of SF 118, beginning with No. 1 for the first report and continuing in numerical sequence for succeeding reports made during the calendar year. The number will be preceded by the symbol of the DE making the report and the calendar year e.g., SWF-79-6, for the sixth report submitted by Fort Worth District of Southwestern Division for calendar year 1979.</P>

                  <P>In all cases where Government-owned land is reported, there shall be attached to and made a part of SF 118 (original and copies thereof), a report prepared by a qualified employee of the holding agency on the Government's title to the property, based upon his review of the records of the agency. The report shall recite:</P>
                  <P>(a) The description of the property.</P>
                  <P>(b) The date title vested in the United States.</P>
                  <P>(c) All exceptions, reservations, conditions and restrictions relating to the title acquired.</P>

                  <P>(d) Detailed information concerning any action, thing or circumstance that occurred from the date of the acquisition of the property by the United States to the date of the report which in any way affected, or may have affected, the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the real property (together with copies of such <PRTPAGE P="215"/>legal comments or opinions as may be contained in the file concerning the manner in which and the extent to which such right, title or interest may have been affected). In the absence of any such action, thing or circumstance, a statement to that effect shall be made a part of the report.</P>
                  <P>(e) The status of legislative civil and criminal jurisdiction over the land peculiar to the property by reason of it being Government-owned land. If the United States does not hold such legislative jurisdiction, the report on government title should so state.</P>
                  <P>(f) All exceptions, reservations, conditions and restrictions imposed by higher authority on the property at time of disposal. No additions or substantive changes to these will be made without prior approval from HQDA (DAEN-REM), WASH, DC 20314.</P>
                  <P>(g) If the property, or any portion of it, has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or has been nominated for listing or nomination, this should be included in the SF 118. Specific fixtures and related personal property having possible historic or artistic value should also be included. (See § 644.317 for information on historic preservation.)</P>

                  <P>There shall be transmitted with the SF 118 copies of outgrants involving the property reported, all conveyances, encumbrances and other instruments affecting the use and operation of the property, including deeds, mortgages, and agreements covering and licenses to use any patents, processes, techniques, or inventions. Where there is more than one like instrument as, for example, agricultural leases, it may be preferable to list them, locate them on the land use map, and furnish a sample copy. FPMR contemplates that muniments of title will be transmitted with the report of excess. The title report (§ 644.356 of this part) will state that HQDA (DAEN-REP) WASH DC 20314 is the custodian of title papers and has been requested by the DE to transmit applicable title papers direct to the GSA Regional Office. Accordingly, as soon as practicable after receipt of an information copy of the declaration of excess by the using service, and a disposal directive, the DE will assign a disposal report number and advise DAEN-REP to transmit the pertinent title papers directly to the appropriate GSA Regional Office, citing the disposal report number as a reference. Simultaneous action by DAEN-REP and the DE to assemble necessary reporting data is important to avoid delay of acceptance by GSA of the Report of Excess. If experience should demonstrate that such simultaneous preparation and transmittal of data is not practical in saving time and effort, the DE will arrange in advance for transmittal of the necessary title data from DAEN-REP for incorporation in the Report of Excess before transmittal by the DE to the GSA Regional Office.</P>

                  <P>(a) Title 42 U.S.C. 1594a-1(b) provides that the proceeds from the disposition of Department of Defense Housing, including related land and improvements, shall be transferred to the DOD Family Housing Management Account for the purpose of debt service. Arrangements have been made between DOD and GSA to implement this law and apply it to excess MCA housing as well as to housing encumbered by mortgage debts such as Capehart and Wherry Housing projects. (See § 644.322(b).)</P>
                  <P>(b) The agreement with GSA calls for separate identification and description in the Report of Excess (SF 118) of those improvements which are considered family housing within the purview of the law and a request in the report that proceeds from disposal be transferred to the DOD Family Housing Management Account. (The actual transfer of funds will be accomplished at Washington level.)</P>

                  <P>(c) Where the Report of Excess includes both housing and property not related to housing, separate schedules (SF 118 a and b) will be prepared to cover the housing involved, including related land and other improvements. The housing schedules should be annotated and arranged categorically to show:<PRTPAGE P="216"/>
                  </P>

                  <P>Excess leaseholds and buildings and improvements to be disposed of separately from the land which, pursuant to § 644.350, must be reported to GSA for screening purposes only, will be reported immediately when the property is determined to be excess to the particular military department having jurisdiction. The report will contain the statement: “This property is reported for screening with civilian agencies by GSA prior to its disposal by the Corps of Engineers. The property is being screened within DOD and when the screening has been completed, appropriate certification will be submitted to GSA.” Screening against defense requirements, pursuant to §§ 644.333 through 644.339, will then be completed and GSA notified of the result. If such screening results in the development of a requirement by one of the other military services, the Report of Excess will be withdrawn and the transfer of the property to the requesting military service effected. This specialized procedure for this type of property is adopted to allow screening for defense requirements by the Corps of Engineers to be accomplished simultaneously with the screening of civilian agencies by GSA. Where circumstances require that this type of property be screened within a limited period of time, the period should be specified and an explanation set forth on the face of the Report of Excess, as, for example: “Buildings are in the way of planned new construction and must be removed or demolished not later than (date). Accordingly, advice must be received on or before (date) as to whether a requirement exists for the property, or whether it is to be transferred or assigned to another Federal agency for removal within the time specified.” If such advice is not received by the time specified, the property should be disposed of without further delay and GSA notified of the action.</P>

                  <P>Detailed guidelines are provided in FPMR Subsection 101-47.4913.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Calculated risk.</E> These guidelines, which are binding on holding agencies, embody the principle of calculated risk. In applying this principle, the anticipated losses and deteriorations, including pilferage and vandalism, in terms of realizable values are expected to be less than expenditures to minimize the risks. Normally, where property is of little value, only periodic surveillance is necessary and care and custody forces will not be maintained. However, where property, regardless of realizable value, is potentially an attractive nuisance to children and curiosity seekers, or is inherently dangerous, the public should be protected by guards stationed on the property or by other satisfactory means. Every effort should be made to minimize the cost of care, protection and maintenance consistent with these principles.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Improvements or alterations.</E> FPMR Subsection 101-47.401-5, provides that improvements and alterations to excess and surplus real property may be considered, with the prior approval of GSA, where disposal cannot be made. However, it is not considered likely that a situation will arise in the Corps' disposal operations where such improvements or alterations can be justified. Repairs necessary for protection <PRTPAGE P="218"/>and maintenance of marketable property will not be undertaken except to prevent serious loss to the Government. Excess equipment or facilities should not be updated or improved. At predisposal conferences, or earlier where practicable, the DE, in coordination with GSA representatives, will furnish specific guidance to the using command as to the minimum acceptable GSA requirement for care and custody. The requirement for minimum maintenance does not extend to historic places. Historic places in excess or suplus status will be maintained in accordance with the letter and spirit of approved Department of the Army criteria for protection, preservation and maintenance of historic places.</P>

All expenses pertaining to care, custody and maintenance will be borne by the holding department or agency, except that such expense for property reported to GSA for disposal and not disposed of within 12 months from the date the formal report of excess was received by GSA, shall be assumed by GSA as of the first day of the succeeding quarter of the fiscal year. GSA will give notice of the receipt of the report of excess and will, within 15 days, furnish advice on the acceptability of the report. (See FPMR as amended, Subsection 101-47.202-10.) Any request made to the disposal agency to defer disposal action, or failure to submit an acceptable report, will extend the obligation of the department with respect to expenses for care and custody caused by such deferment. In the event the department is not relieved of custody within the period for which it is obligated to stand the expense thereof, the retention of care and custody thereafter will be reimbursed by the disposal agency. Because of the magnitude of custodial expense for larger installations and the longer periods of time often consumed in effecting their disposal, it is imperative that reports of excess be made as promptly as possible in order that the 12-month period may commence and terminate as soon as possible and the department's expense minimized.</P>
                  <P>(b) The DE will maintain close liaison with GSA with a view to obtaining prompt transfer of custody and accountability from the department to that agency, and will coordinate transfers between the using service and GSA. However, DEs will not take over custody of an installation or coordinate the transfer of custody until a statement of clearance or a statement that such clearance is not necessary because of the use of the installation has been furnished. Under GSA procedures, the department generally retains the responsibility for care, custody, and accountability of its excess facilities until final disposition is made by GSA. Until that time, the property is to be carried on the real property inventory of the department.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Contracting for care and custody.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>Care and custody of excess and surplus installations should be performed by contract whenever it is legally possible and more economical to do so. Due to the temporary nature of such services and the extreme variations in kind and fluctuations in quality of such services required from time to time, contracting for custodial service will often prove to be more economical and efficient. In contracting for such services which include watchman, patrol and protective services, attention is invited to the prohibition against hiring detective agencies pursuant to the following Act of Congress: “* * * An individual employed by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, or similar organization, may not be employed by the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia.” (5 U.S.C. 3108). This has been construed to apply to employees of organizations which provide services of a detective agency, but not to organizations which are organizations to render watchman, patrol or protective services and do not include detective services as one of their functions (26 Comp. Gen. 303). Custodial and protective services referred to herein are the type ordinarily procured by contract by GSA and other Government agencies charged with the responsibility for <PRTPAGE P="219"/>care and handling of excess and surplus real property pending its disposal in accordance with the FPMR.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Care and custody through interim use.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Upon receipt of initial information that real property is excess, the DE should promptly initiate planning for interim productive use. Interim use should be planned to save care and custody expense but must not interfere with, delay, or retard transfer of the property to another Federal agency or its disposal otherwise. Any permit or lease must have the prior approval of GSA, and shall be for a period not exceeding one year and shall be revocable on 30 days' notice (FPMR Sections 101-47.203-9 and 101-47.312).</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Permits to other Federal agencies.</E> Interested Federal agencies will be afforded a priority in the interim use of excess and surplus real property. The permit will require the Federal agency to perform care and custody and perform routine maintenance. 41 CFR 101-47.203-8, provides for temporary assignment, conditional transfers, and rental or user charges for use of excess property by Federal agencies.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Leases for non-Federal use.</E> Leases of excess and surplus property are made under authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended and AR 405-80. Such leases are subject to the Economy Act (40 U.S.C. 303b), and must be for a money consideration only. The lessee can and should, however, be made responsible for ordinary maintenance and restoration as required by standard Corps of Engineers lease forms. Where a portion of an excess or surplus installation is leased, it may be advantageous to enter into an agreement with the lessee for care and custody of the remainder. The agreement cannot provide for a reduction of rental for the portion leased. The Economy Act may not apply in some cases where industrial plants are determined excess subject to the National Security Clause or similar recapture conditions. Such cases should be coordinated with DAEN-REM on an individual basis.</P>

                  <P>(a) Lands withdrawn or reserved from the public domain, together with Government-owned improvements, which have been determined to be excess to the department, after screening with other DOD agencies and the U.S. Coast Guard in accordance with §§ 644.333 through 644.339, will be processed for disposal in accordance with 43 CFR 2370-2374 and § 644.381 of this part. The DE will file a Notice of Intention to Relinquish as provided by 43 CFR 2372.1. The notice will be filed in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Land Office having jurisdiction.</P>
                  <FP>Excess buildings and improvements on the property should be left in place and no disposal action taken thereon pending further instructions from BLM, unless it is determined that they should be abandoned in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§ 644.472 through 644.500. A copy of the Notice of Intention to Relinquish submitted to the appropriate BLM Land Office will be transmitted to HQDA (DAEN-REM) Washington, DC 20314 and to the appropriate GSA regional office.</FP>

                  <P>(b) If any restoration, or other work, is proposed to be performed on the land, the matter will be forwarded to DAEN-REM for prior approval. Where the DE recommends disposition of the land by GSA as excess property rather than return to the public domain, no restoration of the property will be proposed (see 43 CFR 2372.1). Generally, lands which are unimproved, or contain only minor improvements, will be recommended for return to the public domain. Exception to this procedure should be made where development surrounding, or in the vicinity of the land, has changed its character, although the land itself has not been improved. Another exception would be the situation described in § 644.350(d). Generally lands which are extensively improved will be recommended to BLM for disposal as excess property.<PRTPAGE P="220"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(c) If the authorized officer of BLM determines, pursuant to 43 CFR 2372.3, that the conditions prescribed by that regulation have been met and that the land is suitable for return to the public domain, he will notify the DE, as the representative of the holding agency, that the Department of the Interior accepts accountability and responsibility for the property. A copy of this notification will be furnished to HQDA (DAEN-REP) Washington, DC 20314.</P>
                  <P>(d) If the authorized officer of BLM determines, pursuant to 43 CFR 2374.1, that the land is not suitable for return to the public domain because it is substantially changed in character, and GSA concurs in this determination, he will notify the DE to report the land and improvements, with or without minerals, to GSA as excess property. Upon receipt of this notice, the DE will advise DAEN-REP and report the property to GSA on SF 118, Report of Excess Real Property, including the information on claims and encumbrances furnished by BLM under 43 CFR 2374.1 (c). The holding agency has the same responsibility for care, custody, and accountability of excess public domain as for other property reported to GSA for disposal.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Cancellation of permits.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Land obtained by permit, or some other form of instrument, from another Federal agency on a temporary basis which has not been substantially improved while being utilized by the Department, when determined to be excess in accordance with the procedure set forth in §§ 644.326 through 644.332, will be returned to the Federal agency from which it was obtained.</P>
                  <P>(b) When it is determined by the DE that land obtained by permit, or other form of instrument, from another Federal agency on a temporary basis has been substantially improved while being utilized by the Department, the DE will request DAEN-REM to determine whether the land is excess, or is expected to become excess, to the requirements of the agency from which it was obtained.</P>
                  <P>(1) If the agency from which the land was obtained advises that the land is excess, or is expected to become excess, to its requirements, the improvements will be reported to GSA on SF 118 in accordance with the procedure described in §§ 644.348 through 644.347, with a statement that the agency from which the land was obtained has advised that the land is excess, or is expected to become excess to its requirements, and that the agency will be or has been requested to reassume administrative control over the land. Coincident with the report of excess, action will be initiated to return the land to the agency from which it was obtained.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the agency from which the land was obtained advises that the land is not excess, and is not expected to become excess to its requirements, improvements constructed thereon while the property was being utilized by the Department will be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of § 644.381. Where the improvements are substantial, and cannot be utilized effectively by the agency from which the land was obtained, and it appears that the best interests of the Government may not be served by disposal of the improvements for removal from the site, a report, with recommendations, should be forwarded to DAEN-REM for a determination whether the permit and improvements should be reported to GSA for disposal, or whether other action would be appropriate.</P>

                  <P>(c) The Chief of Engineers, or his duly authorized representatives, will execute and deliver necessary papers effecting the relinquishment of permits and the transfer of real property to other Federal agencies when the installations to which such real property or permits pertain have been determined <PRTPAGE P="221"/>to be excess. However, where permits were obtained at local level, DEs will effect relinquishment in the same manner. Unless otherwise instructed, no action will be taken by the DE to restore or return the lands pertaining to an industrial installation to the agency which granted the permit. DEs will, however, submit the report required in § 644.379.</P>
                  <P>(d) Where an installation embraces lands acquired in fee by a military department and lands acquired for temporary use from other departments or agencies, and if return of the latter type of lands to the department or agency which granted the permit would destroy the integrity of the installation or affect its ultimate disposal as a unit, a report will be made to DAEN-REM with recommendations that they will provide disposition instructions.</P>

                  <P>(b) Upon receipt of the foregoing information, the Chief of Engineers will effect relinquishment of the land by letter. Where the DE has authority to relinquish the land as outlined in § 644.378(c), he will effect relinquishment by letter addressed to the permittor, with a copy to DAEN-REM.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> Where the Department retransfers real property, the use of which has been obtained from other Federal agencies (including withdrawals from the public domain recommended for return to the public domain) by means of use permits, public land orders, or other methods, the property should be restored to a condition as good as that which existed at the time the department took possession, damages by the elements or by circumstances over which the Department has no control excepted, unless the agency from which the property was obtained expressly waives restoration. Restoration of public domain land will not be initiated until the determination is made that the land is suitable for return to the public domain. Public domain land that is to be reported excess to GSA will not be restored. The procedure enunciated in §§ 644.516 through 644.539 relative to neutralization of unexploded bombs or artillery projectiles located on leased premises applies with equal force to Government-owned lands returned to other Federal agencies and to public domain land that is to be reported as excess for disposal by GSA.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority.</E> The report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on the DOD Appropriation Bill, 1966 (Senate Report 625, 89th Congress, dated 18 August 1965), contained the following language:

                  <FP>The Comptroller General considers the foregoing to be a clear expression of Congressional intent, and that authority exists for the Department of the Army to restore (or make payment in <PRTPAGE P="222"/>lieu thereof) lands of other Federal agencies which have been damaged by the Army while being used under agreement.</FP>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of restoration costs.</E> ENG Form 1440-R, Cost of Restoration, appropriately modified, will be used for the preparation of an estimate of cost of restoration, or salvage or market value, for the purpose of determining the cost of restoration.</P>

                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment in lieu of restoration.</E> If the work has not been performed by either agency and a payment is desired in lieu of restoration, the payment is, in effect, an advance of funds. As such, the advance of funds will be accomplished in OCE, based on submission by the controlling agency of SF 1080 properly supported.</P>

                  <P>Procedures to be followed by DEs when civil works properties are surveyed by GSA under E.O. 11954 are contained in chapter 8 of ER 405-1-12.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Predisposal conference.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Where a substantial Army installation, or portion thereof, is involved, the DE will convene a predisposal conference with representatives of the using command, GSA, and other interested parties. Where an Air Force installation is involved, the Major Air Command will take the initiative in convening the conference. In any cases involving flying facilities, Federal Aviation Administration representatives will be invited. The agenda of the predisposal conference should provide for:</P>
                  <P>(1) Determinations on maintenance guidelines based on probable future uses of the property with emphasis on agreements concerning responsibility for assumption of care and custody, in accordance with AR 405-90, AFR 87-4, and §§ 644.368 through 644.375.</P>
                  <P>(2) Review of the SF 118 to assure its acceptability to GSA.</P>
                  <P>(3) Review with GSA, when appropriate, of the advisability of transferring custody and maintenance responsibilities to GSA at an early date.</P>
                  <P>(4) Planning for and, to the extent possible, making definite determinations on interim utilization pending disposal by GSA.</P>
                  <P>(b) It is of utmost importance that excess installations be put to productive use as military operations are phased out. This will do much to lessen the impact of the installation's closing on the economy of the local community. For this purpose, installations, in many cases, will be reported to GSA prior to phase out of military operations. In these cases, the DE has responsibility to insure, to the extent practicable, that other productive use is phased in as military operations are phased out. This can be accomplished only by careful planning and continuous coordination by the DE with using command and GSA. The using command will plan and execute the military phase out. However, the DE will assure that the Report of Excess to GSA specifically identifies and excludes the real and personal property to be retained by the military department. This information is required by GSA for disposal purposes.</P>
                  <P>(c) A report on the predisposal conference will be forwarded to DAEN-REM. Any difficulties indicated by GSA will be summarized in the report, along with any other problems encountered or foreseen.</P>
                  <P>(d) When requested, and on an individual project basis, the DE will prepare a real estate disposal study concerning the transfer of custody and maintenance responsibilities to GSA prior to final disposal. This study will be developed in conjunction with appropriate using command and GSA representatives. Its purpose will be to determine whether the transfer of the excess property to GSA would be more economical and in the best interest of the Government. Important benefits to DOD agencies would be reduction in expenditures and personnel of the military departments for such functions. Copies of the study will be furnished the using command concerned for timely review and recommendations.</P>

                  <P>The DAF will issue a preliminary real estate disposal directive when a disposal project is forwarded to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs and Logistics) for clearance. (Air Force screens its own properties for other defense requirements and clears the disposal with DOD and the Armed Services Committees of the Congress.)

In all cases where a disposal is reported to the Armed Services Committee, the DE will furnish HQDA <PRTPAGE P="225"/>(DAEN-REM) advice when the final report is made to GSA. Where the report is finalized by statement confirming a preliminary report as final, copies of the preliminary report and confirming statement should be distributed in accordance with §§ 644.348 through 644.367. Distribution of preliminary Reports of Excess, except to GSA, will not be made in other cases.</P>

                  <P>To prevent premature disclosure to the public, information on and plans for disposal of all or a portion of an installation should be protected (AR 340-16), until such time as the property is determined excess to Army or Air Force requirements. (The Air Force preliminary real estate disposal directive is not issued until a determination has been made that the property is excess to Air Force requirements.) After determinations of excess are made, it is desirable that information on the availability of the property for disposal be widely disseminated. “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” marking on plans and correspondence pertaining to the excess action may be cancelled by any recipient or holder. Where the classification “CONFIDENTIAL” or higher has been used, documents must be declassified in accordance with AR 380-5.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory authorities.</E> Power to dispose of real estate belonging to the United States is vested in Congress (paragraph 2, Section 3, Article IV, Constitution of the United States), and no real estate of the Department will be sold or otherwise disposed of without authority of Congress. By the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (Federal Property Act), (Pub. L. 152, 81st Congress; 63 Stat. 377) as amended, (40 U.S.C. 471 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), Congress provided authority for utilization of excess property and the disposal of surplus Federal property, and established the General Services Administration (GSA) to administer the provisions of that Act. All excess and surplus Federal real estate and real property components will be disposed of under authority of the Federal Property Act, as amended, unless other statutory authority for such disposal is specifically withheld under the provisions of the Act or enacted subsequent thereto. In connection with disposals made under statutory authority other than the Federal Property Act, attention should be given to the purposes of the legislation and insofar as practicable, disposal of property should be in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the regulations issued thereunder, in order that the greatest overall efficiency and economy be effected.<PRTPAGE P="226"/>

The DE will be governed by these rules and regulations. GSA also issues, from time to time, special delegations of authority to the Department of Defense with power of redelegation.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Issued by the Departments.</E> Policies and procedures of the departments with respect to the control, management, maintenance, and disposition of real estate and real property components located within the continental United States and its territories and possessions, placed in excess status or to be placed in excess status are contained in AR 405-90, AFR 87-4, and AR 405-5/AFR 87-15, except Army civil works property which is governed by ER 405-1-12.</P>

                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Authorities (Special).</E> In addition to the general authority cited in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Department derives authority from a number of special purpose statutes to transfer real property to other Federal agencies and to dispose of real property for special purposes, or to special classes or in a specific manner to achieve a specific objective. Some of these acts are utilized in conjunction with regulations of GSA and some are exercised independently thereof according to the nature of the particular law. These laws are described in subsequent sections of ER 405-1-12.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The interchange of national forest lands is accomplished in three steps: first, agreement must be reached between the two departments involved as to which lands will be interchanged; second, the two departments will jointly notify the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, by letter, of the intention of the two departments to make the interchange agreed upon; third, upon the expiration of 45 days from the date of submission of the notice of intention (counting only days occurring during any regular or special session of the Congress) the two secretaries will execute jointly and cause to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> an order transferring the respective lands of each department to the other.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Initiation of requests for interchange.</E> Requests for interchange of lands may be originated by either the military department involved or the Department of Agriculture. Those originated by the Department of the Army may result from land requirements generated by newly authorized civil works or military construction projects or from authorized expansion of existing projects or as a result of property utilization surveys. Department of the Air Force requirements may develop similarly. When a request originates with the Department of the Air Force requirements may develop similarly. When a request originates with the Department of Agriculture pertaining to a civil works project or a military installation, it will be analyzed and coordinated by the DE with local representatives of the Department of Agriculture and the using service, as appropriate, to determine the feasibility of and need for the acquisition of any forest land to improve administration of the Army project or installation and the availability of Army lands for transfer to the Department of Agriculture. When coordinated analysis indicates the propriety of an interchange, an interchange planning report will be developed by the DE, in coordination with interested local elements of the two departments and submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314, with appropriate recommendations.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents of interchange planning report.</E> The planning report should include the following information:</P>
                  <P>(1) Location of the areas proposed for interchange, including the county or municipality, names of the forest, project or installation, and number of acres to be interchanged by each department.</P>

                  <P>(3) If the areas include acquired lands:</P>
                  <P>(i) Approximate dates, methods and cost of acquisition of Department of the Army lands proposed for interchange.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Interest, restrictions and reservations currently outstanding, to which the lands were subject when acquired, together with such rights subsequently granted by the Government and presently in force.</P>

                  <P>(5) A map, in triplicate, indicating by appropriate color scheme the lands of each department which are to be interchanged. The map should show the jurisdictional boundary, and, where appropriate, the contour elevations used as a basis for determining the extent of the interchange.</P>
                  <P>(6) An informal estimate of the current values of the areas to be interchanged.</P>
                  <P>(7) Information upon which to base a determination by the two Secretaries that the interchange will facilitate land management and provide maximum use thereof for authorized purposes.</P>
                  <P>(8) Any other information or data that might be helpful to representatives of the Department of the Army in answering pertinent questions that may be raised by the committees of Congress.</P>

                  <P>(a) Each agreement for the exchange of real property should be formalized by written contract specifying the terms and conditions of the exchange, including, by reference to exhibits incorporated therein or otherwise, the form and terms of the conveyance of the title to the property to and from the Government. The agreement, in the case of relocation contracts, will be developed in accordance with ER 1180-1-1. Where an exchange of land or interests therein is considered desirable in the course of a condemnation proceeding, the agreement can be incorporated in a stipulation therein (§§ 644.111 through 644.121)</P>
                  <P>(b) Submission to the Chief of Engineers of draft of conveyance.</P>
                  <P>(1) Conveyance will usually be executed by the Secretary or head of the agency involved § 644.441. To avoid impinging on his discretionary powers, the execution of any contract or agreement involving an exchange of real property interests must be approved in advance, be deferred pending execution of the conveyance, or provide that the terms and conditions of any grant to be made pursuant to the contract will be subject to approval by the Secretary or agency head. It is considered preferable that the contract contain a draft of conveyance as an exhibit thereto and, where time will permit, be submitted to DAEN-REM for review prior to final execution of the contract in order to avoid possible difficulties arising from subsequent disagreement over terms acceptable to the signatory of the Government's conveyance.</P>
                  <P>(2) In submitting for final approval and execution the conveyance of the Government's interest in land pursuant to a contract for exchange, the following data should included to support the proposed action:</P>
                  <P>(i) Description and map of the property to be conveyed.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Statements as to how and when the Government acquired title to the property, the nature and extent of its interest therein, and a statement of any encumbrance to which the property is subject and the nature thereof, such as easements for road rights-of-way, utility lines, etc.</P>
                  <P>(iii) A sufficient number of drafts or the conveyance to permit distribution thereof to interested agencies and the grantee.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Two copies of the contract, option, stipulation in condemnation or other agreement which provides for the proposed conveyance, or, in lieu thereof, pertinent excerpts therefrom sufficient to clearly show the nature and extent of the Government's obligation to execute the conveyance.</P>
                  <P>(v) A citation of the statutory authority on which the execution of the conveyance is to be predicated.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Any additional information necessary to a proper understanding of the proposed transaction.</P>
                  <P>(vii) When the exchange agreement is other than a relocation contract, an appraisal report showing the relative fair values of the properties to be exchanged.</P>
                  <P>(viii) A copy of the conveyance to be made to the United States, or a statement by the Attorney General that an acceptable conveyance has been executed and delivered to the United States, and that an opinion of good title has been made or is not required by regulation to be made.</P>
                  <P>(ix) Recommendations of the Division and District Engineers.</P>

                  <P>Title 23 U.S.C. 317 provides that upon application of the Secretary of Transportation, land or materials may be transferred to a state for the construction or maintenance of a right-of-way for any highway adjacent to a Government installation. If, within a period of four months after such application by the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of the Department shall not have certified to the Secretary of Transportation that the proposed appropriation of such land or material is contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the purpose for which such land or materials have been reserved, they may be appropriated and transferred to the state for such purposes. When the need for such land or material ceases to exist, they shall revert to the control of the department. This section applies only to projects constructed on a Federal-aid system, or under the provisions of chapter 2 of title 23 U.S.C. Usually applications for highway rights-of-way or the use of borrow material made under this Act by the Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, on behalf of a particular state can be and are more simply satisfied by the issuance of a road easement or a license to take borrow material. This latter procedure is also desirable in that controls necessary to satisfy military requirements may be retained. Title 23 U.S.C. 107(d) directs Federal agencies to cooperate with the Secretary of Transportation in providing rights-of-way, including control of access, for the interstate highway system over lands and interests in lands owned by the United States.</P>

                    <P>(a) . . . whenever the Secretary of Transportation determines that use of any lands owned or controlled by the United States is reasonably necessary for carrying out a project for airport development under this subchapter, or for the operation of any public airport, including lands reasonably necessary to meet future development of an airport in accordance with the national airport system plan, he shall file with the head of the department or agency having control of the lands a request that the necessary property interests therein be conveyed to the public agency sponsoring the project in question or owning or controlling the airport. The property interest may consist of the title to, or any other interest in, land or any easement through or other interest in airspace. (b) Upon receipt of a request from the Secretary under this section, the head of the department or agency having control of the lands in question shall determine whether the requested conveyance is inconsistent with the needs of the department or agency, and shall notify the Secretary of his determination within a period of four months after receipt of the Secretary's request. If the department or agency head determines that the requested conveyance is not inconsistent with the needs of that department or agency, the department, or agency head is hereby authorized and directed, with the approval of the President and the Attorney General of the United States, and without any expense to the United States, to perform any acts and to execute any instruments necessary to make the conveyance requested. A conveyance may be made only on the condition that, at the option of the Secretary, the property interest conveyed shall revert to the United States in the event that the lands in question are not developed for airport purposes or used in a manner consistent with the terms of the conveyance. If only a part of the property interest conveyed is not developed for airport purposes, or used in a manner consistent with the terms of the conveyance, only that particular part shall <PRTPAGE P="233"/>at the option of the Secretary, revert to the United States.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Approval.</E> The requirement for approval by the President was waived by Executive Order 12079 dated 18 September 1978.

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for conveyance instrument.</E> Under authority delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), when the Administrator of the FAA requests a conveyance from a military department, the instrument of conveyance requires the following provisions as covenants running with the land, binding the grantee, its successors and assigns.</P>
                  <P>(1) That the grantee will use the property interest for airport purposes, and will develop that interest for airport purposes within one year after the date of this conveyance, except that if the property interest is necessary to meet future development of an airport in accordance with the National Airport System Plan the grantee will develop that interest for airport purposes on or before the period provided in the plan or within a period satisfactory to the Administrator and any interim use of that interest for other than airport purposes will be subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.</P>
                  <P>(2) That the airport, and its appurtenant areas and its buildings and facilities, whether or not the land is conveyed, will be operated as a public airport on fair and reasonable terms, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, handicap or national origin, as to airport employment practices, and as to accommodations, services, facilities, and other public uses of the airport.</P>
                  <P>(3) That the grantee will not grant or permit any exclusive right forbidden by section 308(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1349(a)) at the airport, or at any other airport now owned or controlled by it.</P>
                  <P>(4) That the grantee agrees that no person shall be excluded from any participation, be denied any benefits or be otherwise subjected to any discrimination, on the grounds of race, color, religion, age, sex, handicap or national origin.</P>
                  <P>(5) That the grantee agrees to comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to part 21 of the Regulations of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (49 CFR part 21)—nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs of the Department of Transportation—effectuation of title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Agrees that it will terminate any existing exclusive right to engage in the sale of gasoline or oil, or both, granted before 17 July 1962 at such an airport, at the earliest renewal, cancellation, or expiration date applicable to the agreement that established the exclusive right; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) Agrees that it will terminate forthwith any other exclusive right to conduct any aeronautical activity now existing at such an airport.</P>

These notices may be issued repeatedly, and outstanding notices may be amended or supplemented. Upon expiration of a period so fixed without completion by the grantee of the required action, the Administrator may, on behalf of the United States, enter, and take title to, the property interest conveyed or the particular part of the interest to which the breach relates.</P>
                  <P>(9) That, if any covenant or condition in the instrument of conveyance, other than the covenant contained in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, is breached, the Administrator may, on behalf of the United States, immediately enter, and take title to, the property interest conveyed or, in his discretion, that part of that interest to which the breach relates.</P>
                  <P>(10) That a determination by the Administrator that one of the foregoing covenants has been breached is conclusive of the facts; and that, if the right of entry and possession of title stipulated in the foregoing covenants is exercised, the grantee will, upon demand of the Administrator, take any action (including prosecution of suit or executing of instruments) that may be necessary to evidence transfer to the United States of title to the property interest conveyed, or, in the Administrator's discretion, to that part of that interest to which the breach relates.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure for conveyance.</E> Upon receipt of a deed from the District Engineer, DAEN-REM will submit the deed to the appropriate Secretary for execution, and to the Assistant Attorney General, Land and Natural Resources Division, for approval, before returning it to the District Engineer for delivery to the grantee.</P>

                  <P>(v) The conditions, reservations and restrictions to be included in a conveyance under the Act.</P>
                  <P>(2) The District Engineer has been delegated authority to:</P>
                  <P>(i) Give notice of any proposed conveyance under the Act and afford an opportunity to interested eligible agencies in the general vicinity of the land to apply for its purchase; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Determine the period of time in which applications for conveyances may be filed.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The District Engineer shall give notice of the availability of any land for conveyance under this Act and afford an opportunity to eligible agencies in the general vicinity of the land to apply for its purchase (i) by publication at least twice at not less than 15-day intervals in two newspapers having general circulation within the state in which the available land is located and, if any agency of an adjoining state or states may have an interest in the development of such land for public port or industrial facilities, by publication at least twice at not less than 15-day intervals in two newspapers having general circulation within such state or states, and (ii) by letters to all agencies who may be interested in the development of public port or industrial facilities on the available land.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Filing of application.</E> Any agency interested in the development of public ports or industrial facilities upon the available land shall file a written application with the District Engineer within the time designated in the public notice. The application shall state fully the purposes for which the land is desired and the scope of proposed development.</P>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Price.</E> No conveyance shall be made for a price less than the fair market value of the land.</P>
                  <P>(6) <E T="03">Conveyance.</E> Any conveyance of land under this Act for public port or industrial facilities will be by quitclaim deed in the form of Figure 11-5 in ER 405-1-12 executed by the Secretary of the Army.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (1) Proposals to convey land included in navigation projects for development of public port or industrial facilities will be forwarded by the District Engineer, through the Division Engineer, to HQDA (DAEN-REM), with recommendations, and with the information required by § 644.329, and such additional information as will enable the Chief of Engineers to make the determinations required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(2) Upon receipt of notification from the Chief of Engineers that the property is available for sale for development of public port or industrial facilities, the District Engineer shall give notice of such availability in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The public notice will follow substantially the guide format in Figure 11-4 of ER 405-1-12.</P>
                  <P>(3) If two or more applications are received from eligible agencies, all applications, with recommendations, will be forwarded, through the Division Engineer, to DAEN-REM for the determination referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(4) Upon determination of the actual property to be included in a conveyance, the fair market value thereof will be established by an appraisal.</P>

                  <P>(5) Upon the acceptance of an application, negotiations will be conducted at the price established by the appraisal. However, the applicant will be advised that the price is subject to approval by the Secretary of the Army. This is necessary since the Secretary of the Army has not delegated his authority to determine the fair market value for conveyances under this Act. If public port facilities that can be used in connection with proposed industrial facilities have not been constructed in <PRTPAGE P="236"/>the vicinity, no disposal under this authority will be authorized which does not provide for construction of public port facilities.</P>
                  <P>(6) Upon completion of negotiations a quitclaim deed following the sample format in Figure 11-5 of ER 405-1-12 will be prepared and forwarded, through the Division Engineer, to HQDA (DAEN-REM) for execution by the Secretary of the Army, in accordance with the general procedure for submission of deeds for execution as outlined in § 644.441.</P>

                  <P>FPMR 101-47.303-2 provides that the disposal agency shall allow a reasonable period of time for states, municipalities, and their instrumentalities, to perfect a comprehensive and coordinated plan of use and procurement of surplus property in which they may be interested. This provision applies to surplus property that can be disposed of by negotiated sale under the special acts listed in §§ 644.428 through 644.432 for public highways, streets, and alleys under the Act listed in §§ 644.421 and 644.422, by transfer to the District of Columbia under § 644.407, and under the individual agency negotiating authority of the Federal Property Act, (40 U.S.C. 484(e)(3). A listing of the special acts, with the eligible public agencies, and some guides for classification of property for disposal are contained in FPMR, 101-47.4905.</P>

                  <P>Pursuant to FPMR, 101-47.303-1, any item of surplus land not reported to GSA for disposal in accordance with §§ 644.348 through 644.367 will be classified according to its highest and best use, e.g., industrial, commercial, agricultural, or for disposal under the special acts referred to above. Where required by the special acts, classification will be coordinated with the interested Federal agency. The classification will be recorded on ENG Form 1825 (Real Property Classification), with sufficient information to justify the classification. Surplus property may be reclassified from time to time whenever such action is deemed appropriate. Based on its classification, notice of the availability of surplus land for disposal will be given to public agencies eligible to procure such property as provided in § 644.427.</P>

Notices are not required for property having an estimated fair market value of less than $1,000, except where the disposal agency has reason to believe that an eligible public agency may be interested in the property. Notices as provided in this section will be given for all surplus airport property and surplus fee-owned land for which the Army is the disposal agency, that is classified for disposal under a special act, or if there is reason to believe that a public agency may be interested in acquiring the land by negotiation at its appraised fair market value under the Federal Property Act (40 U.S.C. 484(e)(3)(H).</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Airport property.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible transferees.</E> The right to acquire surplus property without monetary consideration for airport purposes, under 50 U.S.C. 1622(g), with the approval of the Administrator of GSA, is limited to states, political subdivisions, municipalities and tax-supported institutions. This is the proper statutory provision governing transfers of entire military airports to state or local agencies for their use as public airports. The right of such transferees is subordinate to the priority of Federal agencies to acquire the property for their own use. Airport property will not be disposed of for any other non-Federal use until every reasonable effort has been made to dispose of it for airport purposes.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Preliminary procedures.</E> (1) Request a determination by the Administrator of the FAA that the surplus land is essential, suitable or desirable for the development, improvement, operation or maintenance of a public airport as required by 50 U.S.C. 1622(g)(1).</P>

                  <P>(2) Upon receipt of a determination by the Administrator of FAA, furnish <PRTPAGE P="237"/>the FAA Regional Office with a description of the property, or a copy of the Standard Form 118 if the property has been reported to GSA for screening, together with a list of the operating and maintenance equipment available for disposal with the airfield, and request that a survey under the Surplus Property Act be made and that, based thereon, recommendations for classification of the property under the Act be furnished.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Classification.</E> District Engineers are authorized to approve ENG Form 1825, Real Property Classification, based on FAA recommendations. Generally, the recommendations of FAA in regard to classification of property, will be followed, except the following will be forwarded to DAEN-REM without final classification action: cases involving reduction in land areas, runways, taxiways, etc.; controversial cases; and cases where changes in the reservations, restrictions, or conditions specified in the Act are recommended by FAA. District Engineers will not classify as airport property, property in excess of that recommended by FAA or property of which the highest and best use is determined to be industrial. Where the District Engineer does not agree with the report of FAA, he will immediately submit complete data setting forth all objections to the report, together with his recommendations, to DAEN-REM.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of availability.</E> Upon classification of the property as airport property, notice of the proposed disposal will be sent by certified mail to the political subdivisions, or municipalities in which the property is located, and also to any other state, political subdivision, municipality, or tax-supported institution which the District Engineer has reason to believe may be interested in the property. A reasonable time will be allowed eligible agencies to submit an acceptable application. Figure 11-6 in ER 405-1-12 is a format for use in preparing the notice.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Advertising.</E> The proposed disposal of airport property will be advertised in at least two newspapers of general circulation within the state in which the airport is located. This advertising will insure notification to political subdivisions, tax-supported institutions, and others that the property is available. Property not classified as airport property will be advertised in accordance with the applicable requirements for the type of property. However, the first advertising of non-airport property adjacent to an airport will contain a statement that the property may be acquired under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, for airport purposes, provided FAA approves such acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Form of application.</E> Public agencies desiring to acquire surplus airport property will be required to submit an Application For Airport Property (Figure 11-7 in ER 405-1-12). The application includes the provisions of section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended. If the applicant desires to enter and use the property prior to conveyance, such other terms and conditions considered desirable and necessary governing interim use of the property by the applicant will be included. The application will be signed by the applicant and forwarded to DAEN-REM for acceptance by proper authority in the Department. Evidence of the applicant's legal and financial ability to maintain and operate the property, as proposed, will also be submitted with the application.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Request for modifications in the provisions of section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as Amended.</E> Should an applicant request modifications in the restrictions and conditions imposed by section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, the application and all pertinent data, including the FAA report, will be forwarded to DAEN-REM. If the requested modification is approved, the case will again be referred to FAA for its recommendation. If FAA does not concur in the modification, the fact will be reported to DAEN-REM for further necessary action.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Personal property.</E> Non-industrial personal property of any other nature or description made available for disposal with an airport and located on it may be transferred with the airport on recommendation by FAA.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Meetings with public bodies.</E> Close cooperation will be maintained with <PRTPAGE P="238"/>FAA, and its representatives will be invited to participate in negotiations with public bodies in connection with transfer of airport property.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Land survey.</E> In the event that a property survey is required to establish a correct metes and bounds description of the land to be transferred as airport property, a survey will be provided by the prospective transferee without cost to the Government.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Transfer instruments.</E> The type of instrument used in conveying or transferring the Government's interest will vary according to the type of property that may be involved, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, wholly Government-owned, mixed owned and leased, and leased property. However, instruments of conveyances will contain provisions required by the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended. Where a lease is involved and it is from other than the prospective transferee, such transferee will be required to obtain a long term lease on the land prior to conveyance of the Government-owned improvements. Execution of the lease to the prospective transferee and acceptance of the application by the Government should be handled simultaneously. Figure 11-8 in ER 405-1-12 is a format of quitclaim deed covering fee-owned and leased land (Airport Property). A quitclaim deed can be used to surrender leased land and convey the improvements and related personal property, or this can be done by supplemental agreement to the lease or other type of contract as considered desirable in accordance with local conveyancing practices.</P>
                  <P>(l) <E T="03">Recordation.</E> All transfer instruments will be recorded by and at the expense of the transferee.</P>
                  <P>(m) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> The Administrator, FAA, is responsible for determining and enforcing compliance of conditions and restrictions contained in any instrument of disposal of airport property, and is authorized to reform, correct, or amend any such instrument for such action as deemed necessary by him under applicable law. Care will be exercised to furnish copies of the application, classification, and instrument of conveyance to FAA so that it can properly perform its compliance function.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> The military departments, when acting as a disposal agency, are authorized under the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 667b-d, in connection with land and improvements that:</P>
                  <P>(1) Can be utilized for wildlife conservation purposes by the agency of the state exercising administration over the wildlife resources of the state wherein the real property lies, or by the Secretary of the Interior; and (2) are chiefly valuable for use for any such purpose and which, in the determination of the GSA is available for such use, to convey such property to such agency without reimbursement or transfer of funds if the management thereof for the conservation of wildlife relates to other than migratory birds, or to the Secretary of the Interior if the property has particular value in carrying out the national migratory bird program. Personal property cannot be conveyed or transferred under this authority and only such improvements as the District Engineer determines to be necessary for proper execution of the applicant's program may be conveyed.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of availability.</E> If property is considered by the District Engineer to be valuable for wildlife conservation purposes, or if interest has been shown in acquiring the property for that purpose, notice of availability should be given to the agency administering state wildlife resources and to the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service if the property has particular value in carrying out the national migratory bird program.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Classification—Factors to be considered and determinations to be made by disposal agency.</E> Should the property be classified as being chiefly valuable for purposes other than wildlife conservation purposes, such as agricultural, commercial, etc., the property may not be transferred to any State or to the Department of the Interior, under the authority cited in paragraph (a) of this section. However, should an application be received for conveyance of the property for wildlife conservation purposes, and the classification of the property indicates that it is chiefly valuable for other purposes, the classification, all pertinent papers and the <PRTPAGE P="239"/>application, together with the Division Engineer's recommendation, will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REM), Washington, DC 20314. In addition to the determination that the property is chiefly valuable for wildlife conservation purposes and is available for such use, the Division Engineer will determine, when recommending that property be conveyed for such use, that the applicant has the legal and financial ability to acquire, operate and maintain the property as proposed, and will furnish information to DAEN-REM to support his opinion. With proper safeguards, contaminated property can be made available for use in the wildlife conservation program.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Application.</E> Any state desiring to make application for property for wildlife conservation will be furnished copies of Application For Real Property For the Conservation of Wildlife with accompanying instructions for preparation. In evaluating the application, the responsible District Engineer will request review of the application by the Regional Office of the Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, and will obtain that Service's recommendation as to the value of the property for wildlife conservation purposes.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Instrument of conveyance.</E> Any instrument of conveyance of property for wildlife conservation will contain the restrictions and conditions required by 16 U.S.C. 667b, c, d. A Sample Deed for Conveyance of Land and Improvements For Conservation of Wildlife, with the statutory restrictions and conditions is provided as Figure 11-10 in ER 405-1-12.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Publication of order.</E> The order required to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> after disposal of the property under this authority will be processed for publication by the Chief of Engineers.</P>

The sale price of land for this purpose will be its fair market value based on its highest and best use as established by an appraisal. Deeds conveying lands for such purposes will contain no restriction on the use of the land.

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Pursuant to the provisions of section 13(d) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended (50 U.S.C., App. 1622(d)), any state, or political subdivision thereof, or any state or Government agency or instrumentality may certify to the disposal agency that a surplus power transmission line and the right of way acquired for its construction is needed for or adaptable to the requirements of a public or cooperative power project. Whenever any property is reported to GSA for screening, it will be assumed that GSA has screened Federal agencies for such purpose and no further screening with such agencies is necessary. Property not reported to GSA for screening will be screened in accordance with §§ 644.333 through 644.339. Screening with the appropriate state agencies will be conducted in all cases.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Whenever a State, or political subdivision thereof, or state or Federal agency or instrumentality certifies that such property is needed for or adaptable to the requirements of a public or cooperative power project, the property may be sold for such utilization at its appraised fair market value. In the event that a sale cannot be consummated and the certification is not withdrawn, such facts will be reported to DAEN-REM in order that a determination of the action to be taken may be obtained from the Administrator, GSA. If no certification from a state or Federal instrumentality as outlined above is received after proper notice is given, the property may be disposed of in the same manner as other excess or surplus real property.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Assignment to Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) or successor agencies for health or educational purposes.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Under section 203(k)(1) of the Federal Property Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(1)) the Administrator, GSA is authorized, under such regulations as he may prescribe and in his discretion, to assign to the Secretary of HEW for disposal, such surplus real property as is recommended by the Secretary of HEW as being needed for school, classroom, or other educational use, or for use in the protection of public health, including research. The Secretary of HEW is authorized under section 203(k)(1), subject to disapproval by the Administrator, GSA after notice to him from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to sell or lease surplus real property for such purposes. Pursuant to FPMR 101-47.308-4, a military department, when acting as disposal agency is authorized to assign property to HEW for disposal for education or health purposes and to disapprove, within 30 days after notice, any transfer of property proposed to be made by HEW for such purposes.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice to Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or Successor Agencies.</E> When real property is reported to GSA for screening prior to disposal by the military department, notification will be given HEW by the GSA Regional Office simultaneously with notification to the District Engineer that the property has been determined surplus to Federal requirements. The District Engineer will furnish such notification directly to the appropriate regional representative of the Department of HEW in the case of nonreportable real property immediately after he determines that the property is surplus to Federal requirements. Such notification will include the following information:</P>
                  <P>(1) A brief description of the property in sufficient detail to enable a determination of its probable suitability for uses authorized in section 203(k)(1) of the Act.</P>
                  <P>(2) When the property may be inspected and where and how arrangements may be made for inspection of the property.</P>
                  <P>(3) That the property will be withheld from advertisement for bids for a period of 20 days from the time of the notification unless the office submitting the notification is sooner informed in writing as to whether the property is needed for school, classroom, or other educational use, or for use in the protection of public health, including research. If within that time notice is received of a known potential need, the property will be held for an additional 45 days or until a certification of need or request for assignment is received, whichever occurs first.</P>
                  <P>(4) The District Engineer shall not give such notification to HEW on surplus buildings and improvements located on surplus leaseholds where their removal from the site will increase the Government's restoration obligations under the lease. Where such a situation exists and GSA is to screen the property prior to disposal by the Department, GSA should be advised to this effect. Where any surplus buildings and improvements (on leaseholds or fee-owned land) are available for off-site disposal, notification will be given HEW (unless time restrictions prohibit as set out in §§ 644.333 through 644.339 and §§ 644.348 through 644.367) but the notification will include the same restoration obligations as would be placed in a sale of the property to a private party.</P>
                  <P>(5) During the 20-day period, action will be taken preparatory to advertising the property for sale. All inquiries received concerning acquisition of the property for such purposes from the state, or local agencies, or qualified organizations seeking the purchase of available real property for health or educational purposes will be referred to the appropriate field representatives of HEW. If, within the 20-day period, HEW shall inform the District Engineer of any known potential requirement, the District Engineer will withhold disposition until a certification of need is received but not to exceed 45 days.</P>

                  <P>(6) Upon receipt from HEW of a certification that the property is needed for educational or public health purposes and a request from HEW for assignment of the property, if the property is available for such purposes, it <PRTPAGE P="241"/>will be assigned by the responsible District Engineer by letter addressed to the HEW office from which the request for assignment was received, citing the Act and GSA regulations as authority therefor. A copy of such letter of assignment will be furnished to the Regional Office of GSA.</P>
                  <P>(7) When notification of the proposed disposal is received from HEW, subsequent to assignment, if their is no reason for disapproval of the proposed disposition, notice from the responsible District Engineer to HEW of approval thereof is not necessary. Under section 203(k)(1), approval is automatically given in the absence of notice of disapproval within 30 days from the date of notification of the proposed disposal. If in the request for assignment HEW furnishes the name of the proposed transferee and states that an application from the transferee is on file and that the proposed use by the transferee is one authorized under section 203(k)(1), the District Engineer, in making the assignment to HEW, may state that no objection is interposed to the proposed transfer of the property.</P>
                  <P>(8) GSA has advised that it is not anticipated that the Corps of Engineers, in acting as the disposal agency, would investigate each request to it by the Department of HEW, because to make such investigations in each case would clearly duplicate the function assigned to the Department of HEW. Doubtful cases would only arise in connection with property for which the highest and best use is industrial or commercial, or where further study may be required by the Federal Government concerning future requirements for the property. In accordance with a further suggestion by GSA, where there is a reasonable doubt as to the propriety of an assignment to HEW or a proposed disposal by it, the request will be referred to GSA for final decision. Such referrals will be made through DAEN-REM.</P>
                  <P>(9) The District Engineer making the assignment of the property will request HEW to furnish two copies of the sales contract. Upon receipt of these copies, together with a request from HEW that the property be transferred, custody will be given to the grantee or transferee named in the sales contract.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Fee-owned land.</E> When fee-owned land for which the department is acting as disposal agency has been found to be surplus to requirements of the Federal Government, has been classified under § 644.426 and disposal is not made to a state, political subdivision, etc., the property will be offered for sale to the highest responsible bidder, except under special circumstances provided in §§ 644.540 through 644.557.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Easements.</E> Easements that are readily assignable will be disposed of in the same manner as fee-owned land. Easements will usually be disposed of with land to which they are appurtenant. Easements may be disposed of to the owner of land which is subject to the easement (the servient estate). A determination should be made as to whether the disposal should be with or without reimbursement to the Government on the basis of all the circumstances and factors involved and with due regard to the acquisition cost to the Government. The amount of such reimbursement should be the appraised fair market value of the easement. In the case of disposal of an easement acquired for the deposit of spoil material a minimum charge of $225.00 will be imposed where relinquishment is being accomplished for the benefit of the owner of the servient estate and where no direct benefit will inure to the Government. A statement as to the <PRTPAGE P="242"/>commercial value will be made when recommending an easement for disposal. The circumstances and factors leading to these determinations shall be documented and retained in the files (FPMR 101-47.313-1).</P>

                  <P>Under the usual circumstances prompt action will be taken to appraise surplus property concurrently with its classification. Appraisals will not be undertaken for property which has been or is likely to be classified for disposal for any of the following purposes: airport; wildlife conservation; public highways, streets and alleys; disposal to the District of Columbia; and property assigned to HEW for disposal. Property that is to be disposed of for other than the above listed purposes will be appraised.</P>

It will include the District Engineer's recommendation of the method or methods of disposal and the reasons therefor; for example, whether improvements or minerals and lands should be sold separately; improvements cannibalized; whether the property should be subdivided; the media for advertising; and other pertinent factors. In addition, the following will be included as part of the disposal plan:</P>
                  <P>(a) Description and map of the lands.</P>
                  <P>(b) Description of buildings and other improvements.</P>

                  <P>(d) Information as to when, from whom, and how the property was acquired.</P>
                  <P>(e) Information as to the estate which the Government has in the land, and reservations and exceptions in and to the Government's title. Outstanding interests granted by the Government or reserved or excepted in the acquisition of the lands will be stated with particularity. The map or plat will delineate any grant, exception, or reservation, such as telephone and telegraph, electric transmission, oil, gas and water lines.</P>
                  <P>(f) Purchase price of land, buildings and improvements acquired with the lands, and the cost of buildings and improvements, if any, constructed by the United States.</P>
                  <P>(g) If there is an indication of valuable minerals, such statement will be made with full explanatory data.</P>
                  <P>(h) Where the estimated value of the land together with improvements and related personal property is in excess of $1,000, the disposal plan will be submitted to DAEN-REM for approval.</P>

                  <P>When recommending disposal of a surplus easement the District Engineer will submit the following:</P>
                  <P>(a) Information as to when and from whom the easement was acquired.</P>

                  <P>(c) Identification of the installation to which it is appurtenant.</P>
                  <P>(d) If the easement has no commercial value, the amount that should be paid by the owner of the servient estate, representing a rebate on the purchase price, or the amount paid for severance damages will be specified. (For example, if the easement was acquired for a 15-year period and the price paid therefor was substantial and one year after acquisition it is returned to the owner of the servient estate, an effort should be made to obtain a rebate on the purchase price although the easement has no commercial value. The same would be applicable to the payment for severance damages).</P>
                  <P>(e) If the owner of the servient estate, or other prospective grantee, is not willing to pay the appraised value in consideration of the release of an easement acquired for a substantial consideration, all action to release the easement will be held in abeyance until such time as an adequate consideration can be obtained for the release. Note the minimum payment for release of spoil easments discussed in paragraph (b) of § 644.435.</P>

                  <P>When leased premises are no longer required for use by the Government, a notice of termination will be given to the lessor in accordance with the terms of the lease, effective as of the date of vacation. The termination notice will be served sufficiently in advance to allow time for compliance by the Government with terms of leases providing for removal of improvements and restoration of premises. Where a lease does not contain provision for continuing renewal without notice and will automatically expire, the Government is not required to give notice <PRTPAGE P="245"/>when it intends to surrender the premises at the expiration of the lease. However, the lessor should be informed, as far in advance as possible, of the Department's intention to vacate, in order that he may plan for a new tenant for other use of the premises. Where a lease provides for a continuing renewal without notice, the DE will ascertain in advance of the beginning of each fiscal year whether the using service has need during the next fiscal year for the premises. When the premises are no longer required, a notice of termination will be served in accordance with the terms of the lease. In the event the lease does not provide for termination by the Government, but the lessor will consent to termination, either in its entirety or partially, a supplemental agreement should be entered into to terminate or amend the lease as of the date the premises will be vacated, Government improvements removed, and restoration completed.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Forms of Notice of Termination.</E> Where leases provide for restoration, Notice of Cancellation (Restoration) will be prepared in sextuplet in accordance with Figure 11-11 in ER 405-1-12. Notice of Cancellation, Figure 11-12 in ER 405-1-12, will be used for leases which do not provide for restoration or for leases where written notice requiring restoration has been submitted by the lessor prior to termination. Notice of termination will be prepared on the letterhead of the DE concerned, who will assign his own form-letter number.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Manner of serving Notice of Cancellation.</E> The Notice of Termination must conform to requirements of state law, and will, whenever possible, be served personally upon the lessor. In some states, to be legally effective personal service is mandatory, unless expressly waived. The lessor will be requested to execute the acknowledgment of receipt of notice on the form. Where the service is effected by registered or certified mail, a return receipt will be requested and a sufficient number of days (in addition to the stipulated period of notice) will be allowed for transmission and receipt of notice. The return receipt properly signed will be evidence that full notice required by the lease has been given. Should the owner refuse or fail to acknowledge receipt of the notice, the officer serving the notice will so certify thereon, giving the date and method of service. In the case of an absentee lessor, where time will not permit use of certified or registered mail for effecting service, notice will be given by telegram to be delivered, not telephoned, to the addressee. In the case of notice by personal service, any available Army facility or personnel in the lessor's locality may be used.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Distribution of Notice of Termination.</E> The original notice of termination will be delivered to the lessor; one copy to the finance and accounting officer who pays the rental; one copy to the using service; and one copy to the DE office files.</P>

The lessor will be invited to have his estimators accompany the survey party. The lessor's estimates of restoration costs should be obtained promptly, and included in the terminal survey for purposes of comparison in accordance with paragraph (c) of § 644.454. Survey and condition reports will not be limited to items for which the lessor specifically requests restoration, but will include all items which the DE determines should be restored in order to fulfill the Government's obligation under the lease.<PRTPAGE P="246"/>

Restoration of leased housing therefor should be coordinated with the using service to minimize payments for repairs which are the obligation of the Government's tenant.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Limits on government obligation to restore.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>The standard lease forms may provide that the Government will, if stipulated notice is given by the lessor, restore the premises to as good a condition as they were in at the time of entering into possession, reasonable and ordinary wear and tear, and damages by the elements, or circumstances over which the Government has no control, excepted. This requirement is subject to certain limitations.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Restoration not to exceed fee simple value.</E> The cost of restoration, or settlement in lieu thereof, will not exceed the fee simple value of the property restored to the condition that existed at time of entering into possession, reasonable and ordinary wear and tear, and damages by the elements, or circumstances over which the Government has no control, excepted. The valuation should be fixed as of the time of termination of the lease.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Where estimated cost of restoration exceeds diminution in value.</E> When it appears that the estimated cost of restoration substantially exceeds the diminution in the value of the premises, occasioned by the Government's use and the damage therefrom, an appraisal will be made of the present value of the property in its unrestored condition and a separate appraisal will be made of the present value of the property, assuming restoration is accomplished as provided in the lease. The difference between the unrestored and restored value, as determined by comparison of the appraisals will be the amount of diminution in the value of the lessor's property and will be the maximum amount of the restoration obligation. As to the measure of damages to be used in establishing the Government's restoration obligation under leases which contain the standard restoration provision, the Comptroller General decided that,

                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>This office would not be warranted in concluding that any greater amount could be legally expended for restoration or paid to the lessor in lieu thereof than the amount by which the market value of the premises has been diminished</P>

                  <FP>(28 Comp. Gen 206). As a corollary, restoration, or payment in lieu thereof, is not authorized where Government improvements enhance the value of the property. Representatives of the General Accounting Office have advised informally that it is not the intention to have appraisals made of the before and after value in each instance and that the lack of such appraisals will not be the cause for questioning a restoration settlement. It is considered, however, that where the estimated cost of restoration is a substantial amount in comparison with the value of the property covered by the lease, such appraisals should be made. Obviously, however, it would not be to the Government's advantage to make appraisals where the estimated restoration cost is small.</FP>

                  <P>Ordinarily, notification by the lessor of his intention to require restoration of the premises is, when required by the terms of the lease, a condition precedent to any obligation on the part of the Government to restore and is a vested contract right which no part of the Government has authority to give away or surrender (16 Comp.

CL 326, that a formal written notice of demand for restoration might be waived, provided knowledge of the lessor's intention to require restoration was conveyed to the Government orally or by implication at, or prior to, the time required under the terms of the lease. In opinion B-48678, 10 April 1945, the Comptroller General expressed the following views along this line:</P>
                  <P>(a) In leases pertaining to provisions for termination by the Government prior to the end of the term, and which require 60 days written notice of demand for restoration, a supplemental agreement relinquishing space prior to the end of the term, which contains a stipulation excepting restoration from the provisions of the release may be regarded as notice to the Government of the lessor's intention to require restoration and an otherwise proper claim for restoration may be considered where the entire transaction is in the interest of the United States.</P>
                  <P>(b) In leases which require 30 days written notice of termination and 30 days notice of demand for restoration, waiver of termination notice by the lessor would constitute sufficient consideration to support a waiver of restoration notice by the Government where the effect of waiving the notices would be to protect more adequately the Government's interest through immediate termination of the lease.</P>
                  <P>(c) Generally, in leases which require 90 days written notice of demand for restoration and 30 days written notice of termination, if it is determined administratively under the particular facts, that the failure to give restoration notice until receipt of termination notice does not affect the merits of the claim for restoration, or operate to the prejudice of the United States, an otherwise proper claim for restoration may be considered.</P>
                  <P>(d) As a general rule, in leases which require 30 days written notice of termination and 30 days written notice of demand for restoration, notice of demand for restoration given within a reasonable time after receipt of termination notice would be sufficient and, in this connection, a few days delay would not be regarded as unreasonable. Where restoration is predicated on other than strict compliance by the lessor with requirements of the lease relative to notice requiring restoration, the facts will be clearly stated in the restoration assembly.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Minor restoration cases—determining extent of restoration required.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) In minor restoration cases, ENG Form 1440A-R, Joint Terminal Condition Survey, will be used. The Government representative, in these cases, will also make a detailed investigation as to the extent of damages, cost of repairs, and other factors sufficient to properly complete and sign ENG Form 1440B-R, Cost of Restoration. In order to effect economies, the DE may arrange for the utilitization of the services of the Facilities Engineer or the using service to perform joint terminal condition surveys. Such use, however, should be coupled with issuance of proper instructions for guidance of the respective personnel. A restoration case is considered to be minor under the following conditions:</P>
                  <P>(1) The initial cost of Government improvements or alterations did not exceed $5,000; and</P>
                  <P>(2) The net salvage value of Government improvements remaining does not exceed $1,000; and</P>
                  <P>(3) The cash payment to the lessor in lieu of restoration does not exceed $1,000; and</P>
                  <P>(4) The lessor has agreed to accept a cash settlement in lieu of physical restoration.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Preparation of ENG Form 1440-R.</E> Use of ENG Form 1440B-R is premised upon the ability of the field investigator to adequately analyze conditions and develop sufficient supporting data as to the cost of the items of restoration involved. While this form is considered self-explanatory, the following is to be noted:</P>
                  <P>(1) The procedure hereunder envisions the use of both ENG Form 1440A-R and ENG Form 1440B-R, which complement each other.</P>
                  <P>(2) The use of ENG Form 1440B-R for estimating restoration costs does not waive the requirements for a proper evaluation of the Government's restoration obligations either as to the legal principles or as to the proper measure of damages.</P>
                  <P>(3) Distribution of these forms, together with any supporting exhibits, will be accomplished in the same manner as set forth in paragraph (b) of § 644.460.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Major restoration cases—determining extent of restoration required.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Engineer estimate and appraisal.</E> Any restoration case not covered by the definitions of minor restoration case in paragraph (a) of § 644.452 is a major restoration case. A complete engineer estimate and appraisal will be prepared by the DE for use in negotiating a cash settlement, or to determine the cost of restoration, if the work is to be performed by the Government. ENG Form 1440-R, Cost of Restoration, will be used for this purpose. A copy of this form will be transmitted to the General Accounting Office in support of settlements made with landowners in the case of military property and contains the minimum data required by that office. Such transmittal is not required when civil works property is involved. In order to afford a measure of flexibility, ENG Form 1440-R is divided into five parts, each relating to specific factors, to be used as conditions may require.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Preparation of ENG Form 1440-R.</E> Comments and instructions for preparation of ENG Form 1440-R are contained in the following paragraphs which are keyed to the item numbers <PRTPAGE P="249"/>on the Recapitulation sheet, part I of the form:</P>
                  <P>(1) “1” to “6” Self-explanatory.</P>
                  <P>(2) “7. Original Cost (Actual or Estimated) of Government-owned improvements, fixtures and alterations: (part 4).” The General Accounting Office requires that, in all cases involving the relinquishment of Government-owned improvements to lessors in lieu of restoration, and in any other cases where a contract is entered into between the Government and another party to transfer improvements, the original cost of the improvements be given. If not ascertainable, an estimate should be submitted. In exceptional cases, where, because of the circumstances or expense of the work involved, neither the original cost nor a reasonably accurate estimate can be given, an explanation of the facts and circumstances is required. Where structures have been built under contract, or improvements made under contract, a citation to the contract under which the work was performed should be submitted with the original cost statement, estimate, or explanation.</P>
                  <P>(3) “8. Estimated Market Value, (Value in place of Government-owned improvements, fixtures, and alterations): (part 4).” An estimate will be made of the current market value of the buildings or improvements in place. In those cases where it is indicated that the Government-owned buildings or improvements located on leased lands may materially enhance the value of the leased site, an appraiser will estimate the market value of the fee title to the leased area in its unrestored condition. He will also separately estimate the market value of the site, assuming restoration as provided in the existing lease. The difference between the fee title value and restored land value will be reported as the “value in place” of the improvements to be sold or otherwise disposed of. “Value in place” is defined as the amount by which the improvements involved enhance the market value of the leased site. This value will serve to establish the top sales price expectancy in negotiations with the landowner.</P>
                  <P>(4) “9. Gross Salvage Value of Government-owned property: (part 4)”. The “gross salvage value” is the highest price obtainable in the open market for Government-owned improvements when sold for use elsewhere than on the leased premises, assuming that no expense to the buyer is involved in the dismantling and/or removal of the improvements from the leased property to the nearest probable market or location of future use. The estimate of gross salvage value should be made in accordance with established property appraisal procedures. Because market demand usually determines the highest and best use to which the components of a group of improvements will be put (e.g., whether a building will be worth more on the market for moving intact to a new site for continued use as a building, or worth more as a stockpile of used construction material), it is important to consider not only prevailing market prices and demand for used construction materials in the vicinity by contacting sources such as local building trades, wrecking companies, used material dealers, etc., but to also give consideration to possible interest by house moving and construction companies and individuals who might utilize improvements intact. Due consideration should also be given in making the estimate to the effect that such facts as the original cost of the improvements, the original cost of the materials therein, and the deterioration or depreciation of the materials in place might have upon the market value.</P>

                  <P>(5) “10. Estimated Cost of Dismantling and/or Removal of Government-owned Property: (part 4).” The estimated dismantling cost and/or cost of removal will be itemized in the appropriate column opposite the itemized listing of improvements on the ENG Form 1440-R (part 4), and the total will be reflected on the recapitulation sheet (part 1). The dismantling cost is the amount of expenditure necessary to accomplish dismantlement in a manner providing the greatest net return to the Government. Net return is the value of the improvements when detached or dismantled, less the cost of dismantling or detaching, and less the cost of removal. The cost of removal is the cost of moving the detached or dismantled improvements to the nearest <PRTPAGE P="250"/>probable market or the nearest installation of the Department having adequate storage space. In cases of frame buildings having concrete or similar permanent-type floors or foundations, the cost of removal of such floors or foundations will not be included as an item of dismantling and/or removal cost. Instead, it will be treated as an item in the estimated “Cost of Restoration other than Cost of Dismantling and Removal” (Item 12). In developing estimates of gross salvage value and costs of dismantling and/or removal, inquiry should be made of experienced tradesmen, used material dealers, wrecking contractors, etc., familiar with the local market for the types of materials and services involving the current costs of loading, hauling, unloading, cleaning, stockpiling and other economic factors contributing to the current local market value of similar materials in useable form.</P>
                  <P>(6) “11. Estimated Net Salvage Value of Government-owned Property: (part 4)”. This amount is obtained by subtracting the estimated cost of dismantling and/or removal (Item 10) from the estimated gross salvage value (Item 9).</P>
                  <P>(7) “12. Cost of Restoration other than Cost of Dismantling and Removal: (part 3)”. From information developed by the joint survey of the property, § 644.447 of this part, it is the responsibility of the real estate officer, or his representative, to advise the personnel responsible for preparing the restoration cost estimate of the items which will require restoration, repair or replacement under the terms of the lease. A brief statement as to the probable cause of damage, in excess of ordinary wear and tear, or resulting from other than circumstances over which the Government has no control, will be included in the supporting data.</P>
                  <P>(8) “13. Total Cost of Restoration: (Item 10 plus Item 12)”. The estimates of cost under Items 10 and 12 will be based on sound estimating practices generally employed for the type of work involved. The estimates will be predicated on performance of the work by contract and, therefore, consideration will be given to justifiable allowances for contractor's profits, insurance, employees compensation payments, and overhead.</P>
                  <P>(9) “14. Net Cost of Restoration: (Item 9 minus Item 13)”. In those cases where the cost of dismantling and/or removal of Government-owned improvements (as defined in Item 10), and the other costs of restoration (as defined in Item 12), exceed the gross salvage value (as defined in Item 9), the difference is a minus quantity and constitutes the maximum amount of money which the Government can pay the lessor, in addition to transferring all improvements to him in lieu of restoration and paying rent during the estimated period of restoration (provided such improvements are not considered to have an “in place” value). If this is a plus quantity, it represents the minimum amount of cash that the Government can accept from the lessor after transferring to him all items of property or equipment shown in the report, less the allowance for rental during the estimated period of restoration.</P>
                  <P>(10) “15. Approximate Time Required for Actual Salvaging and Restoration Operations”. So long as the owner is deprived of use of his property he is entitled to rental stipulated in the lease. A fair allowance will be made in a settlement with the lessor to cover a reasonable time required to fit the premises for use. If all improvements are to be left in place, it may well be that no allowance for rental will be required by the lessor for time required for salvaging.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Negotiating restoration settlements.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>Negotiated settlements in lieu of performance of actual restoration work by the Government are ordinarily favored because they most satisfactorily achieve the objectives of fulfilling the Government's obligations under the lease in the most efficient and economical manner, recouping the greatest amount of the Government's investment in improvements to leased property and maintaining good public relations in the acquisition and disposal of leaseholds. However, because of variable circumstances, this principle cannot be stated as an inflexible rule applicable to every case. It is the responsibility of the DE to carefully consider all possible approaches within <PRTPAGE P="251"/>the scope of this chapter and select the best course of procedure in each case.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Financial limitations which preclude actual restoration.</E> In view of the limitations of the Government's restoration obligations to amounts not in excess of the fee value of the leased property, or the difference in values of the leased property with and without restoration, actual performance of restoration work is precluded where these amounts would be exceeded, and a settlement in lieu of restoration is in order in amounts not to exceed the limitations indicated.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Settlement where property enhanced in value by improvements.</E> Where the leased property has been enhanced in value by the Government's improvements, no restoration should be performed nor payment by the Government made in lieu thereof. Instead, effort should first be made to obtain from the lessor a cash payment to the Government equal to the in place value of the improvements, together with a full release of the Government from any restoration obligations. If the lessor is not willing to pay the in place value, but will offer a lesser amount in excess of the estimated net salvage value, settlement may be reached on that basis. If the lessor will not agree to make payment of any amount, or will offer only an amount which is less than the net salvage value of the improvements, consideration should be given to selling the improvements for removal and accomplishing any remaining restoration by payment in lieu thereof or by actual performance of the work. If it becomes necessary or advisable to arrange for separate sale of any or all of the improvements, the sale should be accomplished in accordance with §§ 644.540 through 644.557. The terms of sale in such case will require the removal of the improvements on or before the expiration or termination of the lease and contains any other special requirements applicable to the particular case, including site restoration. Bids received should be compared with the highest price offered by the lessor, due consideration being given to the cost of restoration, if any, which would remain after removal of the improvements. It must always be borne in mind that the disposition of public property to private parties must be at prices which can be shown to be in the best interests of the Government.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Reaching agreement on estimates of cost.</E> The terminal survey and condition reports specify the items to be restored and the lessor's estimate of cost. Those items reflected on the ENG Form 1440-R (part 3) afford comparison between the lessor's and the Government's estimates. Where there is a variance in the estimates and the lessor's total estimate is lower, effort will be made to settle on the basis of his estimate. If the lessor's overall estimate is higher than the Government's, effort will be made to reach agreement on acceptance of the Government's total estimate. If the lessor's estimate is substantially higher on specific items, it may be desirable to disclose the basis on which the Government's estimate is predicated in order to demonstrate its reasonableness. The Government's estimate of cost for items of restoration may be made available to the lessor upon request. When the lessor requests items of work not shown on the Government's estimate, careful consideration will be given to his request, further inspection of the premises made, when necessary, and a determination made as to whether the Government is obligated under the lease to perform the work. If no liability is determined to exist, the lessor will be fully informed as to the reasons for noninclusion in the estimate. If liability is determined to exist, the estimate will be adjusted accordingly. In any case where the existence or extent of the legal obligation of the Government to restore is questionable, the DE will submit the facts, in writing, to DAEN-REM together with his recommendation. No lease restoration settlement will be allowed to become involved in litigation or formal claims procedure without the matter having been submitted to DAEN-REM for review. When a satisfactory cash settlement by the Government cannot be negotiated, the DE is authorized to perform the actual restoration work.</P>

                  <P>In some cases, owners have been allowed to store personal property, <PRTPAGE P="252"/>owned by them or under their control, on premises leased from such owners by the Government, the personal property not being covered by the lease. The rooms in which this property was stored have been broken into and, upon termination of the lease, it has been found that much of the property is damaged or is missing. Unless the lease specifically places some responsibility on the Government, payment for such damaged or missing property cannot be included in restoration settlements for payment. In the event the lessor refuses to sign a full release, a provision may be included in the supplemental agreement releasing the Government from all liability except for claims for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property stored on the leased premises and not covered by the lease, and the lessor advised that he may submit a claim for the amounts which he considers due him.</P>

If there is an outstanding maintenance and operation contract with the lessor, contained in either the lease or in an independent instrument, which fixes compensation in addition to the rent, the settlement agreement with the lessor will include the rent and such part of the compensation for maintenance and operation as will be necessarily incurred by the lessor during the performance of restoration.</P>

Supplemental agreements may be used to effect restoration settlements of obligations incurred under permits, trespass right agreements, and other unnumbered contracts for the temporary use of land. Restoration settlements may also be effected even though the premises were occupied rent free and without formal contract, provided use of the premises was authorized properly by the Government (Decision of the Comptroller General B-63340, February 1947). Care should be exercised in determining the existence <PRTPAGE P="253"/>and extent of the legal obligation of the Government to restore. Payment will not be made for doubtful items; instead, the other party to the agreement will be advised of his right to submit a claim.

Such estimate will include the value of personal property, buildings, crops, and other property damaged, destroyed or lost by the Government. DAEN-REM upon recommendation of the DE will request the amendment of the proceeding to include the taking of any property for which compensation is to be paid. The same criteria for settlement with lessors as under a negotiated lease will govern. In the event the landowner will not agree to settle, his best offer will be submitted to DAEN-REM, with the DE's recommendation, for consideration. If a tentative settlement is reached, the terms will be included in a stipulation to be filed in the condemnation proceedings, after approval by DAEN-REM and the Department of Justice, which stipulation will specifically provide:</P>

                  <P>DE's are designees of the Chief of Engineers under AR 405-90 to determine the method of disposal authorized by law or regulations which is most advantageous to the Government. Where alternatives are presented, there will be an affirmative finding that the method of disposal approved is most advantageous. In the exercise of this authority, due consideration will be given to the effect of particular methods of disposal on safety and sanitation in the area, the proposed or probable future utilization of Government-owned sites by the Government, or in the case of leased lands, the restoration obligations of the Government under the lease. In order to assure consideration of these factors, disposals by transfer to other Government agencies or by sale intact will be brought to the attention of the installation commander or his representative prior to initiation of disposal action. Reasonable requirements for site clearance consistent with the foregoing criteria should be favorably considered and disposal conditioned accordingly, notwithstanding the fact that such action may result in a greater burden to transferee agencies or, in the case of disposal by sale intact, may result in a reduction in the monetary return which might be reasonably expected in a sale involving less stringent site clearance requirements. DAEN-REM will be informed of any instances of excessive or unreasonable requirements with respect to site clearance. The DE will determine by inspection and survey the method to be used in disposal of buildings and improvements.</P>

                  <P>The procedures for placing buildings and improvements in excess status are set forth in AR 405-90 and AFR 87-4. In instances of land acquisition where buildings and improvements were acquired incident thereto, DEs are designated by the Chief of Engineers under AR 405-90 to make disposition of this property. Coordination with the installation commander concerned is required. When, under AFR 87-4, the responsible DE is called upon by the Air Force Command to furnish an estimate of the value of buildings and improvements for the purpose of determining the approval authority for excessing the property, no formal appraisal will be made. If, in his opinion, the total property exceeds a value of $50,000, he will furnish only a rough estimate of its value in round figures. If the property is, in his opinion, of a value of $50,000 or less, he will limit his statement to this fact and will not specify an estimated valuation.</P>

Real Estate funds will not be used for such demolition. Determination of practicability for use of buildings or improvements in authorized new construction at other sites or for salvage of materials will be made by the DE in accordance with existing instructions relating to use of materials in new construction. Where restoration of leased premises is being performed, it is the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers to perform the necessary demolition work as part of the restoration obligation, as set forth in §§ 644.444 through 644.471. Demolition may be accomplished under contract when special or expert services are required for removal of certain types of structures and funds are available therefor. Unused salvage materials will be turned over to redistribution and salvage officers for redistribution or disposal in accordance with existing regulations pertaining to personal property. The relocation of buildings or improvements on the same installation or for re-erection at another installation is not to be accomplished as a real estate function (AR 420-70). Further, it is provided in AR 420-70 that demolition of buildings or improvements where retention of the salvage for use at the installation is approved, or where no requirement or market is found for buildings or improvements approved for disposal by the Corps of Engineers, is a facilities engineering responsibility. Pursuant to AFR 87-4, disposal of AF buildings and improvements by sale will be accomplished by the Corps of Engineers, but all disposal of such property by salvage will be accomplished by the base commander.</P>

                  <P>During the period held, action preparatory to the publication of Invitations for Bids and Specifications of Sale of Buildings and Improvements will be taken in order to minimize the time lapse between the expiration of the 20-day period and the beginning of the sale procedure. Inquiries received prior to the expiration of the holding period from state or local agencies or qualified organizations seeking the purchase of available improvements for health or educational purposes, will be referred to the appropriate field representatives of HEW.</P>

                  <P>(a) Final disposal is not effected until the improvements have been transferred by HEW to an eligible recipient. Therefore, in the letter of assignment, HEW will be requested to furnish to the <PRTPAGE P="259"/>responsible DE, three copies of the sales contract. One copy of the contract will be forwarded to the officer accountable for the property, together with a certificate of performance upon completion of the operation (the latter to be furnished by the HEW contracting officer), and one copy will be furnished to the property auditor charged with periodic audit of the property records.</P>
                  <P>(b) Should HEW fail to consummate disposition of the improvements after assignment to it and request cancellation of the assignment, the assignment may be cancelled by a letter of cancellation and appropriate disposition of the improvements affected. If there is an excessive number of such requests, DAEN-REM will be informed in order that corrective action may be requested of HEW.</P>

                  <P>Buildings and other improvements made available for disposal by competent authority and not needed for further Federal utilization, or assigned to HEW, will be diposed of by sale by the responsible DE. Sales will be accomplished in the following manner:</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Sale to lessor where restoration is not required.</E> Where the terms of a lease do not require restoration by the Government, it may nevertheless be in the best interest of the Government to negotiate a sale of the improvements to the lessor. In such cases, the DE is authorized to negotiate such sale where the net salvage value of all improvements located on the premises involved in any one lease is less than $1,000, and the sales price is determined to be as high as can be expected under the circumstances and compares favorably with the Government estimate prepared in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Sale under options.</E> All leases or other rights of occupancy will be examined to determine whether the owner of the land has an option to purchase buildings or other improvements. See § 644.486 for sale of improvements constructed under Emergency Plant Facilities or similar contracts.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Sale to eligible public agencies, the Boy Scouts, and the public.</E> The sales procedure, including notice to eligible public agencies and advertising, set forth in §§ 644.540 through 644.557 will be followed in the sale of buildings or other improvements.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Appraisal.</E> Except as otherwise provided in §§ 644.540 through 644.557 buildings and other improvements will be appraised prior to sale. Except as provided in § 644.490, appraisal will be based on the highest and best use which may be for (1) removal and use intact; or (2) for dismantling, and removal and stockpiling the salvageable material for reuse or sale.</P>

                  <P>Procedure for the disposal of property constructed under a facilities contract on lands neither owned by nor leased to the Department is set forth as follows:</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">By using service.</E> Disposal of structural components as well as equipment may be accomplished by the using service. The term “structure” is defined to mean plant equipment which:</P>
                  <P>(1) Is held under a facilities contract of the Department;</P>
                  <P>(2) Is not readily severable;</P>
                  <P>(3) Is a separate building or a complete structural addition to a building in which the Government otherwise has no interest, such as a wing, and in which a defense contractor carries on part or all of his defense production.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">By the Corps of Engineers.</E> Where disposal of structures, as well as other plant equipment located within such structure, is to be accomplished by the Corps of Engineers, instructions will be issued as to the extent to which the Corps of Engineers will participate in such action. Subject to special instructions by DAEN-REM, the following coordinated actions will be taken:</P>
                  <P>(1) The using service will report to the Corps of Engineers the property which is excess to the Department's needs.</P>

                  <P>(2) The excess directive report will include the designation by name and address of a responsible officer of the using service to join with the DE concerned as a representative of the Chief <PRTPAGE P="260"/>of Engineers. These two representatives will meet with the contractor within seven days of their appointment to determine his interest in acquiring all or any part of the facilities. This determination will be made in the shortest possible time.</P>
                  <P>(3) The meeting with the contractor will promptly establish those facilities to be retained by the contractor and those to be declared excess. Waiver of existing options will be obtained where necessary.</P>
                  <P>(4) Equipment that is of no interest to the contractor will be disposed of by using service in accordance with applicable regulations.</P>
                  <P>(5) Custody of and accountability for the entire facility remains with the using service until other arrangements have been completed.</P>
                  <P>(6) The Corps of Engineers will complete negotiations for property to be retained by the contractor as rapidly as possible.</P>
                  <P>(7) When an agreement has been reached with the contractor, the DE or his contracting officer may execute the supplemental agreement to the lease or facilities contract transferring improvements, including machinery and equipment as a unit. Authority for the transfer should be recited in the supplemental agreement. In the case of a supplemental agreement to a facilities contract, authority will be obtained from the using service through its local representative for the DE or his contracting officer to sign the supplemental agreement transferring the improvements, including machinery and equipment to the contractor. (Figure 11-18 in ER 405-1-12 is the suggested format for Supplemental Agreement to Emergency Plant Facilities Contract.)</P>
                  <P>(8) Upon completion of negotiations, the responsible DE will issue instructions to the using service to dispose of equipment not included in the final negotiations in accordance with applicable regulations. Accountability for the property will be transferred at this time to the new owner or, in the case of real property retained by the Department, to the Corps of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(9) Property not disposed of to the contractor will be disposed of in the same manner as improvements located on surplus leasehold property.</P>

                  <P>By direction of the President and pursuant to GSA and Army regulations, special procedures have been established for disposal of chapels. Surplus chapels must be segregated from other buildings for sale intact, separate and apart from the land, for use as shrines, memorials, or for religious purposes. Where the chapel is located on surplus land and it is determined the chapel may properly be used in place, a suitable area of land may be set aside for such purposes and sold with the chapel (§ 644.430).</P>

                  <P>Promptly upon receipt of an approved DA Form 337 (Request for Approval of Disposal of Building and Improvements) or AF Form 300, the DE will solicit applications by public advertising. Advertising will consist of publication of notice in newspapers, paid advertising when necessary, posting of notices in public places, and mailing of invitations to all known local churches. A period of thirty (30) days will be allowed in which to file written applications. Instructions will provide that the applicant will give his name, address, and denomination if applicable. The advertisement will describe the chapel, give its location, terms and conditions of sale, and the time and place where application must be filed. The advertisement will also state that the sale price will be made available upon request of interested parties, and that the Chief of Chaplains will select the purchaser. To assist that office in making a recommendation, the following information should be included in applications for the purchase of chapels:</P>
                  <P>(a) Purpose and intent of the use of the chapel.</P>

                  <P>When sold under the provisions of § 644.490, chapels shall be sold subject to the condition that during their useful life they will be maintained and used as shrines or memorials, or for religious purposes, and not for any commercial, industrial, or other similar use. The contract or deed of sale will provide further that in the event the purchaser fails to maintain and use the chapel for such purposes there shall become due and payable to the Government the difference, if any, between the appraised fair market value of the chapel, as of the date of the sale, without restriction on its use, and the price actually paid. This difference should be figured at the time of sale and included in the contract of sale or deed of conveyance.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Price.</E> The sale price of the chapel structure in the case of sale for use as a shrine, or memorial, or denominational house of worship, will be at its fair value in the light of the conditions imposed relating to its future use, and the estimated cost of removal from the site. Appraisals made to establish the price of specific chapels will be predicated on:</P>
                  <P>(1) The fair value of the material in place, less the cost of dismantling, removal of the material to the outside limits of the installation, and the cost of restoring the site.</P>
                  <P>(2) The restrictions imposed on the future use of the chapel with due regard to the difference between the fair value price obtainable in the open market and that which might be obtainable in the limited market to which sale is restricted.</P>
                  <P>(3) In addition to the criteria set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section cognizance will be taken of the prevailing prices of chapels being sold by other disposal agencies within the general area in which chapels are being disposed of by the Corps of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Provisions of sale.</E> (1) Disposal of chapels which are not excess or surplus will be conditioned on the removal of the chapels from the premises. In the disposal of chapels located on excess or surplus leased land, no commitments will be made to purchasers for the continued use of utilities and services (sewer, water, electric, fire protection, guarding). Arrangements may be made between the lessor of the premises and the purchaser to leave the chapels in place, provided the lessor releases the Government from any and all obligations to restore the premises occupied by the chapel.</P>
                  <P>(2) Care will be exercised that, prior to the disposal of the chapel, equipment such as organs, hymn books, and other ecclesiastical furnishings have been removed or shipped in accordance with applicable regulations.</P>
                  <P>(3) All copies of the contract evidencing the sale of chapels will be accompanied by copies of the instructions, if any, received from the Chief of Chaplains authorizing the disposal. If no such instructions have been received, the DE will attach a statement that in the absence of instructions, all known interested parties have been contacted and that the disposal has been made after due consideration of applications, the uses to be made of the chapel building and the need therefor.</P>

The Corps of Engineers does not dispose of crops on military lands. However, when lands are in the custody of the Corps for construction purposes, the Corps will dispose of crops thereon.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Civil works.</E> (1) When the DE believes that standing timber, embedded gravel, sand or stone (whether designated for disposition with the land or by severance and removal from the land) is excess to requirements, he will submit a recommendation to DAEN-REM for approval. The DE is authorized, however, to dispose of standing timber or other forest products required to be removed incident to construction and operational requirements of the project; that which is generated incident to recreational development or the management of public park and recreational areas or wildlife management areas; or that which is generated in accordance with approved forest management supplements to the approved Master Plan (ER 1130-2-400). As far as practicable, high grade species in short supply will not be disposed of, but will be retained for possible defense requirements. When the amount for sawtimber under the above criteria available for disposal exceeds 5,000,000 board feet, request will be made to DAEN-REM, for determination of whether there are any defense requirements for the timber. The request will include an estimate of the amounts by species and the range in sizes. All timber disposals, except those involving timber below the project clearing line or in construction sites, will be compatible with the planned use of the areas for the purpose to which they are allocated in approved Master Plans and such disposals will be incidental to that use. The DE may authorize the disposal of growing crops when their disposal is deemed necessary to prevent waste.</P>
                  <P>(2) Under the provisions of section 5 of the act of 13 June 1902, as amended, (33 U.S.C. 558), proceeds from disposal of these items on civil works property may be returned to the appropriation.</P>

                  <P>(a) Live timber and merchantable dead timber will be marked for cutting in accordance with the land management plan, Master Plan, or forestry supplement thereto, and cutting will be limited to the timber so marked. The disposal plan will contain sufficient information in this respect to permit preparation of specifications for inclusion in the invitation for bids.</P>
                  <P>(b) Utilization of existing roadways and construction of new roads and saw mills should be limited to the minimum necessary.</P>
                  <P>(c) Requirement that the customary practices in elimination of fire hazards be observed with necessary specifications therefor.</P>
                  <P>(d) The installation commander will be consulted to obtain his desires in connection with security measures, and other matters affecting the installations, and the requirements of such measures will be set forth specifically.</P>
                  <P>(e) Any measures considered necessary to protect timber and young growth not marked for cutting will be specified.</P>
                  <P>(f) Where an appraisal is required, the appraisal report will be prepared by a competent forester. The report will indicate the number and size of each species and classification of trees to be cut; the estimated board feet in log scale measurement; linear estimates of pole timber, and amount of cord wood. The appraiser should indicate in the appraisal report what, in his opinion, should be acceptable as a minimum price for different types of timber, as well as a total or lump sum estimate for the whole. Methods of administration and sale of timber by the Army or Air Force should follow the same general rules employed by the U.S. Forest Service in its sales and forestry practices. U.S. Forest Service personnel may be available for this work, if desired, on a reimbursable basis, provided the size of the area in question and the location render such arrangements feasible.</P>
                  <P>(g) Minor sales, involving lots with an estimated value of $1,000 or less, may be accomplished by the reservoir manager on civil works projects under general guidance issued by the DE Real Estate Branch. In such minor sales, two or more informal bids, in writing, will be obtained, if possible. If only one bid can be obtained, the proposed sale will be posted for a period of ten (10) days.</P>

                  <P>As soon as possible after standing timber, embedded sand, gravel, or stone are made available for disposal, other Federal agencies having activities within the vicinity of the location of the property and which, in the opinion to the responsible DE, may desire transfer of the property will, to the extent practicable or economical, be notified of the availability of the property for disposal. Such notification should include the following: information concerning how arrangements can <PRTPAGE P="265"/>be made to inspect the property; information concerning conditions governing cutting, harvesting, mining, or removal of the property and a statement that the property will be advertised for sale upon the expiration of fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the notification, unless a request for transfer of the property, or a statement that a request for transfer of the property, or a statement that a request therefor may be made, is received within the fifteen (15) day period. Should a Federal agency request within the fifteen (15) day period, that disposal of the property be withheld pending determination of a requirement, disposal will be withheld not longer than sixty (60) days from the date of notice of availability, unless DAEN-REM approves withholding disposal for a longer period. Disposal will not be withheld for such sixty (60) day period, extended if applicable, if to do so would interfere with construction or other necessary operations. Should a request be received from a Federal agency for transfer of the property, the property will be transferred in accordance with existing procedures without reimbursement except as provided by FPMR 101-47.203-7. If no request for transfer is received, the property will be considered surplus and disposed of by one of the methods outlined in §§ 644.507 and 644.508. The foregoing instructions do not apply to land clearance operations performed either by contract or force account. It applies only to those cases where it is proposed to offer property for sale.</P>

                  <P>Prior to making a recommendation for excess, the state of contamination of the property must be determined by the installation commander as either of the following:</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Category One.</E> Those lands such as ammunition plants, storage, test, impact and training areas, bombing or target ranges, which may contain explosives or unexploded ordnance. The <PRTPAGE P="267"/>report will include proposed methods of neutralization and the costs thereof.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Category Two.</E> Those lands or buildings which are suspected of being contaminated with radiological, industrial-military chemicals, or explosives. The U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency (USATHAMA), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland 21010, will be requested to determine if the land contains any of the above contaminants, to determine the extent of the contamination, and to decontaminate, if necessary before such property is reported for disposal.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Category One.</E> The DE, as designee of the Chief of Engineers, will satisfy himself that the clearance work, as certified in the Statement of Clearance, has been performed and that such clearance complies with the requirements of this section. If the DE determines that the completed clearance work is not sufficient, he will request the using command to perform the necessary additional clearance. The Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB), has responsibility for reviewing and approving, from an explosive safety veiwpoint, clearance reports for real property declared excess and offered for disposal. DDESB should be consulted for review and analysis of accomplished clearance work for Category One property when determinations of adequacy are not within the capacities of the DE. Requests, fully documented, for review and/or analysis by the Board may be forwarded to DAEN-REM for submission to the Board. Department of Defense procedures include staff study of all proposed excess reports by the Board before grant of “Prior Approval” for those disposals requiring reports to the Armed Services Committees (10 U.S.C. 2662). When the clearance work has been satisfactorily performed, disposal action will be continued as set forth in this subpart F. If the DE determines that further clearance work is necessary to render the land safe for use but that such further clearance work is not economically justified, he will make a report to DAEN-REM with his recommendations and pertinent supporting data. The report will include a statement of the current status of the excess action.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Category Two.</E> The U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency (USATHAMA) is responsible for the identification and containment and elimination of all toxic and hazardous materials, and related contamination on all and/or buildings where an excessing action is planned. USATHAMA will conduct the survey and assessments of all proposed excess property to establish the type and quantities of contaminants and then plan, direct and control the program to decontaminate and clean up the property. Following the completion of the decontamination clean up program, USATHAMA will prepare a clearance statement stating the property has been cleared of all toxic and hazardous materials reasonably possible to detect using present state-of-the-art methodology, and it will provide any exceptions or restriction for utilization of the property. Clearance statements which identify contaminations of ammunition and explosives will be submitted to the DDESB for review. Category Two items may include chemical munitions or agents, liquid propellants and pyrotechnics. The clearance statement will be forwarded through the Major Army Command (MACOM) to DAEN-REM.</P>
                  <P>(1) Decontamination of Category Two real property will comply with the requirements of TB 700-4 (Decontamination of Facilities and Equipment). The Bulletin provides general policies, responsibilities and procedures applicable whenever potentially contaminated facilities are disposed of to other Government agencies, qualified users in industry, or to the general public.</P>
                  <P>(2) The degrees of decontamination are designated in TB 700-4. Contaminated real and personal property excessed for disposal shall be decontaminated to XXXXX before it can be removed from the Government premises, or transferred to nonqualified Government or industry users.</P>

Any decontamination work required will be monitored by USATHAMA who will also review the completed program for adequacy of decontamination. If these arrangements cannot be worked out, USATHAMA will decontaminate the property at the request of the Office, Chief of Engineers (OCE), or the property may be withdrawn from excess and returned to the using command for care and custody.</P>
                  <P>(b) A Statement of Clearance is required for industrial property to be declared excess in order to establish a qualitative and quantitative base line for the contaminants present. In the Statement, USATHAMA will provide an adequate description of the nature and extent of the contamination. The description furnished to the DE should include the following information:</P>

                  <P>Military scrap can contain or be contaminated with explosives, chemicals, and other hazardous materials. The primary consideration in determining whether scrap metal will be removed should be the safety of persons coming on the land in question and, secondarily, the prevention of accidents resulting from the sale and/or use of the scrap metal subsequent to the land passing from the jurisdiction of the Department. The DE will insure the removal or destruction, by using command, of all military scrap and scrap metal from lands suitable for cultivation or other subsurface operations. In the case of land unsuitable for cultivation or other subsurface operations, all military scrap will be removed or destroyed and scrap metal removed, if it is reasonably possible to do so. Cases where it is considered impracticable to remove the scrap metal, will be reported to DAEN-REM for final decision. In such instances, pertinent data and the recommendation of the DE will be furnished. Disposition of military scrap or scrap metal by dumping into inland waters or by land burial in other than an approved landfill is prohibited.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Restricting future of artillery and other ranges.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>Experience indicates that, on ranges where high explosive projectiles have been fired or dropped, such as artillery, bombs, mortars, rockets, grenades, and the like, it is impossible to make certain that land in impact areas is absolutely safe for unrestricted use. Such impact areas receive a high concentration of fire, and the properties of these projectiles are such that many duds are deeply buried. Depth of burial, as well as the concentration of fragments or components, will affect the dependability of mine detectors. Since there is no known definite period within which such projectiles will become inert through weathering and corrosion, such contaminated areas can be <PRTPAGE P="269"/>safely released for restricted use only, even after decontamination work has been carried to its practicable limit. Such restrictions will usually be in the form of a recommendation that the land be restricted to surface use only. Restrictions will be based solely on the type and/or extent of contamination. If land is contaminated to such a degree that it is considered it cannot be rendered safe for any use, disposal action will be suspended and the facts will be reported to DAEN-REM-C with the DE recommendations.</P>

                  <P>Where leased land has been contaminated, whether excess to military requirements or being used, it may often prove advisable and economical to acquire the fee to such properties. Prior to considering the return of contaminated leased land to owners, District Engineers will assist installation commanders in preparing an analysis as a basis for recommendation to acquire or not acquire such areas. In the case of recommended restriction of use, notice should be given the lessor as described in § 644.525.</P>
                  <P>(a) Where such a restriction reduces the value of the land, the Department will, if consistent with the terms of the lease, pay damages equal to the reduction in value as of the effective date of termination.</P>

                  <P>(b) As stated in § 644.525, the owner should be advised that the Department <PRTPAGE P="270"/>is willing to remove or destory any potentially dangerous materials that may be discovered in the future, subject to the availability of funds.</P>

Such publication should be in the form of articles in official news media, or posting of the premises whenever the later is considered most feasible. Such publicity should include instructions that, in the event of the discovery of an explosive missile, or an object resembling an explosive missile, or other contaminant, or in the event of an injury caused by an explosion or exposure to toxic agents, such discovery or injury should be reported immediately to the DE. An effort should be made to obtain the cooperation of local law enforcing agencies to insure the prompt reporting of an accident, or the discovery of an explosive missile. The majority of accidents are the result of the removal of explosive missiles by individuals for sale to scrap dealers. Scrap dealers in the vicinity of contaminated lands should be informed of the inherent dangers and asked to cooperate by refusing to buy military scrap from private parties.</P>

                  <P>When land has been previously declared clear of explosives or other dangerous material so as to be safe for all uses and disposed of, but is later found to have been contaminated to such an extent that, in his opinion, it is dangerous to the public, the DE will request the former using command to re-examine the land for the purpose of determining the extent to which the original Statement of Clearance should be revised and to determine the kind and cost of any further clearance work by the using command which would be required to place the property in the condition set forth in the original Statement of Clearance. If further clearance work is necessary and considered economically justified, the DE will request the using command to perform such work and furnish a new Statement of Clearance and record of the further clearance effected. If further clearance work is not considered economically justified, he will make a report thereof to DAEN-REM with his recommendations and pertinent supporting data. Recommendation for reacquisition of contaminated lands will be limited to those which involve full restrictions of both surface and subsurface uses. Where subsurface use of lands only is to be restricted, it is preferable to make compensation to the owners through claim procedure, when and if instituted by the owner on his own initiative.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Return of public domain land.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The procedures described elsewhere in §§ 644.516 through 644.539 to carry out the continuing responsibility of the Department of the Army to assist and advise the land holder and protect the public from dangerous substances on or in the land after release are equally applicable to public domain lands. Air Force policy and procedures are generally comparable.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Congressional.</E> A provision has been added to several laws enacted by Congress that upon request of the Secretary of the Interior at the time of final termination of the reservation effected by the Act, the Department of the Army shall make safe for nonmilitary uses the land withdrawn and reserved, or such portions thereof as may be specified by the Secretary of the Interior, by neutralizing unexploded ammunition, bombs, artillery projectiles, or other explosive objects and chemical agents. The intent of the provision is explained by a statement of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, House of Representatives, in Report No. 279, 87th Congress, 1st Session: The committee concluded that it would be appropriate to amend the bill to designate the Secretary of the Interior to act on behalf of the Federal Government in delineating the areas to be made safe for nonmilitary use when the lands are no longer required for defense purposes. “It is expected that the Secretary of the Interior will not require the Department of the Army to proceed with expensive cleanup work in areas where there would be no direct benefit. On the other hand, it is anticipated that when potential resources or use values are such as to make dedudding or decontamination advisable, the Secretary of the Interior will identify those resources and values for the Secretary of the Army. This will permit a full and complete justification in the event that a separate appropriation therefor is required.” Report No. 279 also quoted the following policy statement by the then Bureau of the Budget:
                  </P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <P>. . . requirement for decontamination should be related to a standard not only of practicability, but also to one of economic feasibility that takes into account the desired future use and value of the land to be decontaminated.</P>

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Army.</E> The congressional policy outlined above does not change the existing Army policy. Its principal effect is to make it clear that the Secretary of the Interior has an equal interest with the Secretary of the Army in the final decision on whether it is practicable or feasible to clear lands for return to the public domain, and the extent of clearance. No difficulties in reaching agreement with Interior in these matters are anticipated. Where large expenditures are involved it will usually be necessary to request a special appropriation, leaving the final decision to Congress. In any instance, if difficulty in reaching agreement with officials of the Bureau of Land Management (or the Secretary of the Interior) should occur, it will be reported promptly to DAEN-REM with complete background data for review and instructions.</P>

                  <P>Where Air Force range lands are proposed for disposal, the AFLC, in most cases, will make an economic study to determine the extent of clearance that is justified by the relative values of the property before and after decontamination. For this purpose, AF commands declaring range lands excess will submit a copy of the excess recommendation to the AFLC. Upon request, the DE will prepare and furnish a disposal planning report to the AF Logistics Command for assistance in making the economic study. The disposal planning report will include, but need not be limited to, the following:</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Advertising.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition and purposes.</E> GSA regulations require that disposal agencies shall widely publicize all surplus real property which becomes available for sale. Sales will be made to the highest responsible bidder after advertising. Advertising consists of the preparation of Invitation for Bids, the posting of copies thereof in public places, their distribution to interested persons or prospective bidders, and publication of notice of sale in newspapers where such publication is deemed advisable or is required by this subpart F. The purpose of advertising and obtaining competition in selling Government property is:</P>
                  <P>(1) To give all qualified persons equal opportunity to bid for the property.</P>
                  <P>(2) To secure for the Government the benefits which flow from competition.</P>
                  <P>(3) To prevent criticism that favortism has been shown by officers or employees of the Government in making sales of public property.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice to Department of Commerce.</E> A condensed statement of proposed sales of surplus real property by advertising for competitive bids, except where the estimated fair market value of all the property included in the advertisement is less than $5,000, shall be prepared for publication in the U.S. Department of Commerce publications, “Commerce Business Daily.” Guideline is contained in the Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR) 1-1005.1, (formerly the Armed Services Procurement Regulation). Forward statement to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Commerce Business Daily, P.O. Box 5999, Chicago, Illinois 60680.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Whether newspaper advertising in addition to distribution and posting of Invitation for Bids is desirable will depend upon the value of the property and in some instances the anticipated interest in the property. The ever-changing market requires different methods or efforts to obtain the best price for the Government. The time allowed for submission of bids will depend upon the time available, usually 30 days. If available, a longer period may be desirable based on value and other factors. A shorter period may be necessary and, in an emergency, a period of less than 10 days may be allowed. However, the contracting officer should make a record of written findings to support such a decision. If the emergency is based on requirements of the using command that appear questionable, a report with recommendations should be forwarded to DAEN-REM by the most expeditious means.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Bidders mailing lists.</E> Instructions contained in procurement regulations are applicable generally for establishing, maintaining, and controlling bidders mailing lists (DAR 2-205). Generally, all proposed sales should be preceded by an advance notice, to eliminate disinterested bidders and as a measure of economy in printing and distributing voluminous Invitation for Bids. Notice to bidders will provide that their failure to respond to two successive sales offerings will result in the removal of their names from the bidders list. When time does not permit an advance notice, one copy of the Invitation may be sent to the potential bidder, which contains the following notice: <E T="03">“Attention Bidders.</E> If interested in bidding on any or all items, three (3) additional copies will be furnished on request.” The advance notice will describe the property offered and ordinarily provide that Invitation for Bids will be mailed on request or may be picked up at the installation or project at the time the property is inspected.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Inspection of the property.</E> Upon request, interested persons should be permitted to make appropriate inspection of the property, including inventory records, plans, specifications, and engineering reports, subject to any restrictions necessary in the interest of national security and to such reasonable rules as may be prescribed by the using command or the DE.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Award and notice to bidders.</E> Award shall be made with reasonable promptness by notice to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the Invitation for Bids, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered, provided that any or all bids may be rejected when it is in the public interest to do so. When an award is made, unsuccessful bidders should be notified promptly and their earnest money deposits returned.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Equal offers.</E> Equal offers mean two or more offers that are equal in all respects taking into consideration the best interests of the Government. When equal acceptable offers are received, award shall be made by a drawing by lot limited to the equal acceptable offers received (See also § 644.542.)</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Public auction.</E> When authorized by GSA, sales of surplus property may be made through contract auctioneers. Consideration should be given to auction sales when there is likely to be considerable interest in the property. GSA Regional Offices have had experience with actions, maintain lists of qualified auctioneers, are in a position to give other advice and assistance, and may authorize auction sales on behalf of GSA, pursuant to FPMR 101-47.304-7. Auctioneers retained under contract shall be required to publicly advertise for bids in accordance with applicable provisions of that regulation. The prior approval of DAEN-REM will be obtained before auction sales are undertaken.</P>

                  <P>The Federal Property Act provides that real property and related personal property with an aggregate total cost of $1,000,000 or more (or personal property with an acquisition cost of $3,000,000 or more) or patents, processes, techniques, or inventions, regardless of cost, shall not be disposed of to any private interest until the advice of the Attorney General has been received as to whether the proposed disposal would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the anti-trust laws. Prior to obligating the Government on any such disposal, Division Engineers will furnish DAEN-REM information on the probable terms and conditions of the sale. DAEN-REM will use the information as the basis for a request to the Attorney General for advice. Under the provision cited, the Attorney General is allowed up to 60 days to furnish the advice requested. The Federal Property Management Regulation, § 101-47.301.2 provides guidance on the information to be furnished. Where indentical bids in excess of the $2,500 are received, FPMR 101-47.304-8 provides for a report to the Department of Justice. Section 101-47.304-8 provides guidance for such reports to be addressed to the Attorney General, WASH, DC, 20530.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Determination of acceptable offers after advertising.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Generally an acceptable offer is one which:</P>
                  <P>(1) Is submitted by a responsible bidder.</P>
                  <P>(2) Conforms to the Invitation for Bids.</P>
                  <P>(3) Equals or exceeds the appraised fair market value of the property.</P>
                  <P>(4) Was independently arrived at in open competition.</P>
                  <P>(b) A formal appraisal is not required where real property components:</P>
                  <P>(1) Are to be offered on a competitive sale basis that will adequately test the market.</P>
                  <P>(2) Are at the same location and are to be sold under a single advertisement.</P>
                  <P>(3) Have a total estimated fair market value of $10,000 or less for all property to be sold.</P>

                  <FP>The determination as to necessity for a formal appraisal because of the $10,000 limitation may be made by an experienced real estate employee who need not be a real estate appraiser. This determination may be in the form of a simple written statement that in the judgment of the signer the property is not considered to exceed $10,000 in value. In these cases, awards will be supported by a determination by the DE that the market was adequately tested, and the price bid reasonable. For the purpose of records and reports, the sale price will be recorded as the fair market value. If it appears the market was not adequately tested, bids <PRTPAGE P="275"/>will be rejected and the property readvertised, or, if time does not permit readvertising, a sale may be consummated using the procedure provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</FP>
                  <P>(c) All land, irrespective of estimated value, and all other real property and components with an estimated value in excess of $10,000 will be appraised. Where an acceptable offer, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, is not received for such property as a result of public advertising, it will be readvertised unless the responsible DE determines, based upon written findings which shall be preserved as part of the permanent file, that further public advertising will serve no useful purpose.</P>
                  <P>(d) Where no acceptable bid is received as a result of the second advertising, or a determination was made that further advertising would serve no useful purpose or is not feasible, the DE may negotiate a sale at the highest price obtainable, provided:</P>
                  <P>(1) All bids are first rejected.</P>
                  <P>(2) The total of the appraised value for all property included in any single sales contract does not exceed $1,000.</P>
                  <P>(3) All past bidders, on any of the items, and any other known interested parties are afforded a fair opportunity to participate in the negotiations.</P>

                  <P>(e) Where the appraised or estimated value of all items to be included in a single sales contract exceeds $1,000, and no acceptable bid is received, the high bidder may at the discretion of the DE be given a reasonable period, not to exceed five working days, to increase his bid. At the same time all other bids shall be rejected and bid deposits returned. If the high bidder increases his offer to an amount equal to the total appraised or estimated value of the items involved, the DE may consummate the sale. All other cases will be forwarded to DAEN-REM together with an opinion as to whether the market was adequately tested and the highest price offered is reasonable, and with recommendations as to the course of action to be followed. If a negotiated sale to other than the highest bidder is recommended, information for preparation of a report to the Government Operations Committees of Congress will be included, as required in paragraph (c)(2) of § 644.544.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Negotiated sales.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">To private parties.</E> Negotiated sales to private parties are not viewed with favor. Generally, such negotiated sales will be approved only where an emergency exists that will not permit advertising, where advertising would serve no useful purpose, or where a negotiated sale is in the best interest of the Government. Emergencies which justify sales without advertising do not ordinarily justify sales without competition. Instances are rare where the emergency is such that time does not permit the oral solicitation of quotations from more than one source. In any sales which are made without benefit of advertising, competition by informal solicitation and quotation will be obtained to the maximum extent feasible under the circumstances. Such sales should be negotiated at the best terms obtainable and at not less than the appraised fair market value.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">To eligible agencies.</E> (1) Acts of Congress listed in the Federal Property Management Regulation, § 101-47.4905 (Illustrations), authorize negotiated sales of surplus real property to states and other eligible public agencies listed therein. The Acts listed, except section 203(c)(3)(H) of the Federal Property Act (40 U.S.C. 484(c)(3)(H)), cover special classifications of property for specialized use, the most important of which is disposal of airport property. The section of the Act cited authorizes negotiated sales of surplus property to states, territories, possessions, political subdivisions thereof, or tax-supported agencies thereof, provided the appraised fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained. (The other Acts listed in § 101-47.4905 provide for disposal subject to conditions of use but without consideration, or at reduced consideration, except power transmission lines which are sold without conditions but at the appraised fair <PRTPAGE P="276"/>market value.) Notification that surplus property is available for disposal will be given to eligible public agencies for all airport property and for any other property where there is reason to believe that an eligible public agency may be interested in the property or that the property may be adaptable to the agency's use (§§ 644.400 through 644.443).</P>
                  <P>(2) Title 10, United States Code, Section 4682, authorizes the Secretary of the Army to sell obsolete or excess material at fair value to the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The Judge Advocate General has held that buildings and other improvements no longer required by the Department be sold to that organization at the appraised fair market value.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Authority to negotiate.</E> (1) The DE is authorized to dispose of land, improvements, related personal property and real property components (including standing timber and embedded sand, gravel, and stone-quarried products in their unmined or natural state) with an estimated fair market value of $1,000 or less by negotiated sale without advertising, provided that such action is within the purview of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and satisfactory terms of disposal can be obtained. Except as provided in § 644.543 and paragraph (b) of § 644.544 all sales are not less than the appraised fair market value. See paragraph (d) of this section for requirement for appraisal by contract.</P>
                  <P>(2) All other proposals to negotiate sales without advertising will be submitted to DAEN-REM for advance approval. In submitting such proposals, the nature of the emergency or other situation justifying the waiver of advertising will be clearly stated. The property involved will be adequately defined, and the appraised fair market value and proposed price will be set forth. Negotiated sales of surplus property with an appraised value in excess of $1,000 under provisions of the Federal Property Act cited in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, require submission of an explanatory statement to the Government Operations Committees of Congress. Under the FPMR, a statement must be submitted at least 35 days in advance of each such negotiated disposal. When required, the DE will forward a draft of statement to HQDA (DAEN-REM) for transmittal to GSA for submission to the Committees.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Appraisal by contract.</E> Pursuant to Federal Property Management Regulation, § 101-47.304-9(b), where sales are to be negotiated under the authority provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a contract appraisal should be obtained provided that the cost of such a contract would not be out of proportion to the recoverable value of the property and is in the best interest of the Government. If such is not the case, the head of the disposal agency, or his designee, may authorize any other appropriate method to obtain an estimate of fair market value. Requests for waiver will be forwarded to DAEN-REM.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Record to justify waiver of advertising.</E> (1) A written justification for negotiated sales made under the authority of these instructions will be prepared and filed by the DE with the record of disposal in each case. A copy of Standard Form 1036 may be used for this purpose.</P>
                  <P>(2) Except for those cases covered by paragraph (b) of this section, the nature of the emergency compelling waiver of advertising, the reason why it was considered that advertising would serve no useful purpose, or why the negotiated sale was considered to be in the best interest of the Government, will be clearly stated. In cases where an explanatory statement is transmitted to the Committees on Government Operations, a copy of that statement will be furnished the appropriate GSA Regional Office and filed with the record of the case as the required documentation of justification for waiver of advertising. DAEN-REM will make available to the DE necessary copies of such statements for filing or distribution.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Form of invitation for bids and contract of sale.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>Sale contract forms will be prepared by the DE conducting the sale. ENG Form 571-R, Invitation for Bids, Bid and Acceptance, Sale of Surplus Real Property will be used as a guide in sales of bare land or improved land and related personal property. ENG Form <PRTPAGE P="277"/>1038-R, Invitation for Bids, Bid and Acceptance, Sale and Removal of Buildings (or other Real Estate Improvements), will be used as a guide in sales of buildings and other improvements for removal from the site. These forms are designed for use in normal sales of land and real estate improvements pursuant to existing delegations of authority. The DE is authorized to change the formats, to rearrange the sequence of paragraphs, and to add or to delete paragraphs in whole or part, as local circumstances require, but no substantive departure from the forms is authorized without prior specific approval of DAEN-REM. Whenever a sale is to be conducted pursuant to a special delegation of authority, and whenever the circumstances of a sale are such as to render use of these forms inappropriate, a form will be devised by the DE to meet the requirements of the particular sale involved, and forwarded to DAEN-REM for approval. Suggested additional provisions and conditions for use in the sale of standing timber are contained in ENG Form 2140-R, Supplement to Standard Form 114 for use in Timber Sales Contract. In preparing sale contract forms, the following instructions will be followed:</P>
                  <P>(a) A definite date and time will be set for the opening of bids.</P>
                  <P>(b) Bids will be prepared in quadruplicate, all copies to be signed by the bidder.</P>
                  <P>(c) The Invitation for Bids will require each bidder to submit with his bid a certified check, cashier's check, traveler's check, or United States postal money order drawn to the order of the “Treasurer of the United States” for at least 20 percent of the bid. When the cash bid may be a small part of the total consideration (where such dismantling and restoration is involved), the DE should set a definite higher amount as a bid deposit. Also, in such cases a performance bond, adequate to discourage breach of contract after only partial performance, may be required.</P>
                  <P>(d) For real property components the Invitation for Bids will require payment in full within seven days after the successful bidder is notified that his bid is accepted and, in any event, prior to removal of the property. The time specified for completion of payment for land will depend upon the sum of money involved.</P>
                  <P>(e) Bids may be submitted for one or any number of items. Items or lots of real property will be offered in such reasonable quantities as to permit all bidders, small as well as large, to compete on equal terms. Land, however, will not be subdivided solely for this purpose, and in the case of timber sales or sales of embedded sand, gravel and stone, it may not be feasible to have more than one purchaser operating in the same area. Further, it may not be to the Government's interest. Buildings will be offered for sale as single items whenever practicable but submission of bids covering specified groups as an item or all of the buildings may be permitted if the DE considers such a procedure is in the best interest of the Government. It may sometimes be advantageous to divide the buildings into appropriate groups and to permit bidding on individual buildings or on specified groups of buildings or on the entire lot. When such bids are permitted, the Invitation for Bids, ENG Form 1038-R, will be flagged to inform bidders that lump sum bids on the entire lot (and specified groupings, if this procedure is appropriate) may be made but will not be accepted unless the lump sum bid exceeds the total of the highest bids received on each item (or on the groupings).</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Credit.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Payment of the purchase price over an extended period of time should be considered only when the price is a considerable amount, and it may be to the Government's interest to extend credit. Prior to offering property for sale on an extended payment plan basis, approval from DAEN-REM will be obtained. Extension of credit will be within the limitations of FPMR 101-47.304-4. Credit cannot be extended, except to state or local governments, nor can any other special condition be applied, unless provision was made for it in the Invitation for Bids.</P>

Adoption of the following guides in the development and administration of sales programs will help to avoid unjustified requests for extensions of time:</P>
                  <P>(a) Establishment of realistic periods for completion of the sales contract.</P>
                  <P>(b) Necessary and justified extensions to be authorized subject to posting additional bond to insure performance and payment of adequate consideration where use of Government land is involved.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Under the provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, a number of surplus real properties of the United States certified by the Governor of the state in which located and by the Secretary of the Army, Navy or Air Force as the case was, as being suitable and needed for use in training and maintaining civilian components of the Armed Forces under their respective jurisdictions, were conveyed by the Administrator of the War Assets Administration or by the General Services Administration to states, their political subdivisions or tax-supported instrumentalities for <PRTPAGE P="280"/>such purposes. These conveyances contained a number of covenants, conditions, restrictions and reservations, designed to insure the use and maintenance of the property and appurtenances for the purpose for which conveyed and otherwise to protect the interest of the United States. The Secretary of Defense is authorized by (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(4)(d)) to:</P>
                  <P>(1) Determine and enforce compliance with the terms, conditions, reservations and restrictions contained in any instrument by which such transfer was made;</P>
                  <P>(2) Reform, correct, or amend any such instrument by the execution of a corrective, reformative, or amendatory instrument where necessary to correct such instrument or to conform such transfer to the requirements of applicable law; and</P>
                  <P>(3) Grant releases from any of the terms, conditions, reservations and restrictions contained in, and convey, quitclaim, or release to the transferee or other eligible user any right or interest reserved to the United States by any instrument by which such transfer was made, if he determines that the property so transferred no longer serves the purpose for which it was transferred, or that such release, conveyance, or quitclaim deed will not prevent accomplishment of the purpose for which such property was transferred: Provided, that any such release, conveyance, or quitclaim deed may be granted on, or made subject to, such terms and conditions as he shall deem necessary to protect or advance the interest of the United States.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority delegated.</E> The authority vested in the Secretary of Defense under the Act cited in paragraph (a) of this section has been redelegated to the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, respectively (Department of Defense Directive 5100.10, dated 16 March 1972).</P>

                  <P>The DE, within whose areas of military real estate operations are located the facilities conveyed under the authority mentioned in § 644.559, will make physical inspections thereof for the purpose of determining compliance with the terms of the conveyance. Any evidence of noncompliance should be reported to DAEN-REM in order that appropriate recommendations may be made to the respective Secretary for corrective action. A detailed statement of the facts and recommendations of the DE should be included in the report. Inspections should be scheduled and integrated with outlease compliance inspection itineraries in the interest of economy. This requirement for inspections extends to properties conveyed by the Secretary of the Army or Air Force under special legislation, where the deed of conveyance imposes conditions on future use of the land. These inspections need not be made annually but frequently enough so that the DE is assured that the conditions are being observed, and at least every three years. Compliance with conditions in deeds for property conveyed for airport purposes under 49 U.S.C. 1723 and 50 App. U.S.C. 1622g is the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation; for property conveyed for purposes of health and education, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare or its successor agencies (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(4)). The Commander, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command, is responsible for compliance with the National Security Clause, and similar conditions, in deeds conveying industrial properties.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) This part implements the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), setting forth the Army's policies and responsibilities for the early integration of environmental considerations into planning and decision-making.<PRTPAGE P="282"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) This part requires environmental analysis of Army actions affecting human health and the environment; providing criteria and guidance on actions normally requiring Environmental Assessments (EAs) or Environmental Impact Statements (EISs), and listing Army actions that are categorically excluded from such requirements, provided specific criteria are met.</P>
                <P>(c) This part supplements the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) for Army actions, and must be read in conjunction with them.</P>
                <P>(d) All Army acquisition programs must use this part in conjunction with Department of Defense (DOD) 5000.2-R (Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and Major Automated Information Systems).</P>
                <P>(e) This part applies to actions of the Active Army and Army Reserve, to functions of the Army National Guard (ARNG) involving federal funding, and to functions for which the Army is the DOD executive agent. It does not apply to Civil Works functions of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) or to combat or combat-related activities in a combat or hostile fire zone. Operations Other Than War (OOTW) or Stability and Support Operations (SASO) are subject to the provisions of this part as specified in subpart H of this part. This part applies to relevant actions within the United States, which is defined as all States; the District of Columbia; territories and possessions of the United States; and all waters and airspace subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The territories and possessions of the United States include the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Wake Island, Midway Island, Guam, Palmyra Island, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island, and Kingman Reef. This regulation also applies to actions in the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Marianas, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau (Republic of Belau). In addition, this part addresses the responsibility of the Army for the assessment and consideration of environmental effects for peacetime SASO operations worldwide. Throughout this part, emphasis is placed upon quality analysis of environmental effects, not the production of documents. Documentation is necessary to present and staff results of the analyses, but the objective of NEPA and Army NEPA policy is quality analysis in support of the Army decision maker. The term “analysis” also includes any required documentation to support the analysis, coordinate NEPA requirements, and inform the public and the decision maker.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Army policies.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) NEPA establishes broad federal policies and goals for the protection of the environment and provides a flexible framework for balancing the need for environmental quality with other essential societal functions, including national defense. The Army is expected to manage those aspects of the environment affected by Army activities; comprehensively integrating environmental policy objectives into planning and decision-making. Meaningful integration of environmental considerations is accomplished by efficiently and effectively informing Army planners and decision makers. The Army will use the flexibility of NEPA to ensure implementation in the most cost-efficient and effective manner. The <PRTPAGE P="290"/>depth of analyses and length of documents will be proportionate to the nature and scope of the action, the complexity and level of anticipated effects on important environmental resources, and the capacity of Army decisions to influence those effects in a productive, meaningful way from the standpoint of environmental quality.</P>
                <P>(b) The Army will actively incorporate environmental considerations into informed decision-making, in a manner consistent with NEPA. Communication, cooperation, and, as appropriate, collaboration between government and extra-government entities is an integral part of the NEPA process. Army proponents, participants, reviewers, and approvers will balance environmental concerns with mission requirements, technical requirements, economic feasibility, and long-term sustainability of Army operations. While carrying out its mission, the Army will also encourage the wise stewardship of natural and cultural resources for future generations. Decision makers will be cognizant of the impacts of their decisions on cultural resources, soils, forests, rangelands, water and air quality, fish and wildlife, and other natural resources under their stewardship, and, as appropriate, in the context of regional ecosystems.</P>
                <P>(c) Environmental analyses will reflect appropriate consideration of non-statutory environmental issues identified by federal and DOD orders, directives, and policy guidance. Some examples are in § 651.14 (e). Potential issues will be discussed and critically evaluated during scoping and other public involvement processes.</P>
                <P>(d) The Army will continually take steps to ensure that the NEPA program is effective and efficient. Effectiveness of the program will be determined by the degree to which environmental considerations are included on a par with the military mission in project planning and decision-making. Efficiency will be promoted through the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Awareness and involvement of the proponent in the NEPA process.</P>
                <P>(2) NEPA technical and awareness training, as appropriate, at all decision levels of the Army.</P>
                <P>(3) Where appropriate, the use of programmatic analyses and tiering to ensure consideration at the appropriate decision levels, elimination of repetitive discussion, consideration of cumulative effects, and focus on issues that are important and appropriate for discussion at each level.</P>
                <P>(4) Use of the scoping and public involvement processes to limit the analysis of issues to those which are of interest to the public and/or important to the decision-making at hand.</P>
                <P>(5) Elimination of needless paperwork by focusing documents on the major environmental issues affecting those decisions.</P>
                <P>(6) Early integration of the NEPA process into all aspects of Army planning, so as to prevent disruption in the decision-making process; ensuring that NEPA personnel function as team members, supporting the Army planning process and sound Army decision-making. All NEPA analyses will be prepared by an interdisciplinary team.</P>
                <P>(7) Partnering or coordinating with agencies, organizations, and individuals whose specialized expertise will improve the NEPA process.</P>
                <P>(8) Oversight of the NEPA program to ensure continuous process improvement. NEPA requirements will be integrated into other environmental reporting requirements, such as the ISR.</P>
                <P>(9) Clear and concise communication of data, documentation, and information relevant to NEPA analysis and documentation.</P>
                <P>(10) Environmental analysis of strategic plans based on:</P>
                <P>(i) Scoping thoroughly with agencies, organizations, and the public;</P>
                <P>(ii) Setting specific goals for important environmental resources;</P>
                <P>(iii) Monitoring of impacts to these resources;</P>
                <P>(iv) Reporting of monitoring results to the public; and</P>
                <P>(v) Adaptive management of Army operations to stay on course with the strategic plan's specific resource goals.</P>

                <P>(11) Responsive staffing through HQDA and the Secretariat. To the extent possible, documents and transmittal packages will be acted upon within 30 calendar days of receipt by each office through which they are staffed. These actions will be approved <PRTPAGE P="291"/>and transmitted, if the subject material is adequate; or returned with comment in those cases where additional work is required. Cases where these policies are violated should be identified to ASA (I&amp;E) for resolution.</P>
                <P>(e) Army leadership and commanders at all levels are required to:</P>
                <P>(1) Establish and maintain the capability (personnel and other resources) to ensure adherence to the policies and procedures specified by this part. This should include the use of the PPBES, EPR, and other established resourcing processes. This capability can be provided through the use of a given mechanism or mix of mechanisms (contracts, matrix support, and full-time permanent (FTP) staff), but sufficient FTP staff involvement is required to ensure:</P>
                <P>(i) Army cognizance of the analyses and decisions being made; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Sufficient institutional knowledge of the NEPA analysis to ensure that Army NEPA responsibilities (pre- and post-decision) are met. Every person preparing, implementing, supervising, and managing projects involving NEPA analysis must be familiar with the requirements of NEPA and the provisions of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) Ensure environmental responsibility and awareness among personnel to most effectively implement the spirit of NEPA. All personnel who are engaged in any activity or combination of activities that significantly affect the quality of the human environment will be aware of their NEPA responsibility. Only through alertness, foresight, notification through the chain of command, and training and education will NEPA goals be realized.</P>
                <P>(f) The worldwide, transboundary, and long-range character of environmental problems will be recognized, and, where consistent with national security requirements and U.S. foreign policy, appropriate support will be given to initiatives, resolutions, and programs designed to maximize international cooperation in protecting the quality of the world human and natural environment. Consideration of the environment for Army decisions involving activities outside the United States (see § 651.1(e)) will be accomplished pursuant to Executive Order 12114 (Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, 4 January 1979), host country final governing standards, DOD Directive (DODD) 6050.7 (Environmental Effects Abroad of Major DOD Actions), DOD Instructions (DODIs), and the requirements of this part. An environmental planning and evaluation process will be incorporated into Army actions that may substantially affect the global commons, environments of other nations, or any protected natural or ecological resources of global importance.</P>
                <P>(g) Army NEPA documentation must be periodically reviewed for adequacy and completeness in light of changes in project conditions.</P>
                <P>(1) Supplemental NEPA documentation is required when:</P>
                <P>(i) The Army makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns; or</P>
                <P>(ii) There are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impact.</P>
                <P>(2) This review requires that the proponent merely initiate another “hard look” to ascertain the adequacy of the previous analyses and documentation in light of the conditions listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If this review indicates no need for new or supplemental documentation, a REC can be produced in accordance with this part. Proponents are required to periodically review relevant existing NEPA analyses to ascertain the need for supplemental documentation and document this review in a REC format.</P>

                <P>(h) Contractors frequently prepare EISs and EAs. To obtain unbiased analyses, contractors must be selected in a manner avoiding any conflict of interest. Therefore, contractors will execute disclosure statements specifying that they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project. The contractor's efforts should be closely monitored throughout the contract to ensure an adequate assessment/statement and also avoid extensive, time-consuming, and costly analyses or revisions. Project proponents and NEPA program managers must be continuously informed and involved.<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) When appropriate, NEPA analyses will reflect review for operations security principles and procedures, described in AR 530-1 (Operations Security (OPSEC)), on the cover sheet or signature page.</P>
                <P>(j) Environmental analyses and associated investigations are advanced project planning, and will be funded from sources other than military construction (MILCON) funds. Operations and Maintenance Army (OMA), Operations and Maintenance, Army Reserve (OMAR), and Operations and Maintenance, Army National Guard (OMANG), RDT&amp;E, or other operating funds are the proper sources of funds for such analysis and documentation. Alternative Environmental Compliance Achievement Program (non-ECAP) funds will be identified for NEPA documentation, monitoring, and other required studies as part of the MILCON approval process.</P>
                <P>(k) Costs of design and construction mitigation measures required as a direct result of MILCON projects will be paid from MILCON funds, which will be included in the cost estimate and description of work on DD Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data.</P>
                <P>(l) Response actions implemented in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) are not legally subject to NEPA and do not require separate NEPA analysis. As a matter of Army policy, CERCLA and RCRA analysis and documentation should incorporate the values of NEPA and:</P>
                <P>(1) Establish the scope of the analysis through full and open public participation;</P>
                <P>(2) Analyze all reasonable alternative remedies, evaluating the significance of impacts resulting from the alternatives examined; and</P>
                <P>(3) Consider public comments in the selection of the remedy. The decision maker shall ensure that issues involving substantive environmental impacts are addressed by an interdisciplinary team.</P>
                <P>(m) MATDEVs, scientists and technologists, and CBTDEVs are responsible for ensuring that their programs comply with NEPA as directed in this part.</P>
                <P>(1) Prior to assignment of a MATDEV to plan, execute, and manage a potential acquisition program, CBTDEVs will retain environmental analyses and data from requirements determination activities, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) organizations will develop and retain data for their technologies. These data will transition to the MATDEV upon assignment to plan, execute, and manage an acquisition program. These data (collected and produced), as well as the decisions made by the CBTDEVs, will serve as a foundation for the environment, safety, and health (ESH) evaluation of the program and the incorporation of program-specific NEPA requirements into the Acquisition Strategy. Programmatic ESH evaluation is considered during the development of the Acquisition Strategy as required by DOD 5000.2-R for all ACAT programs. Programmatic ESH evaluation is not a NEPA document. It is a planning, programming, and budgeting strategy into which the requirements of this part are integrated. Environmental analysis must be a continuous process throughout the materiel development program. During this continuous process, NEPA analysis and documentation may be required to support decision-making prior to any decision that will prejudice the ultimate decision or selection of alternatives (40 CFR 1506.1). In accordance with DOD 5000.2.R, the MATDEV is responsible for environmental analysis of acquisition life-cycle activities (including disposal). Planning to accomplish these responsibilities will be included in the appropriate section of the Acquisition Strategy.</P>
                <P>(2) MATDEVs are responsible for the documentation regarding general environmental effects of all aspects of the system (including operation, fielding, and disposal) and the specific effects for all activities for which he/she is the proponent.</P>

                <P>(3) MATDEVs will include, in their Acquisition Strategy, provisions for developing and supplementing their NEPA analyses and documentation, <PRTPAGE P="293"/>and provide data to support supplemental analyses, as required, throughout the life cycle of the system. The MATDEV will coordinate with ASA (AL&amp;T) or MACOM proponent office, ACSIM, and ASA(I&amp;E), identifying NEPA analyses and documentation needed to support milestone decisions. This requirement will be identified in the Acquisition Strategy and the status will be provided to the ACSIM representative prior to milestone review. The Acquisition Strategy will outline the system-specific plans for NEPA compliance, which will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate MDA and ACSIM. Compliance with this plan will be addressed at Milestone Reviews.</P>
                <P>(n) AR 700-142 requires that environmental requirements be met to support materiel fielding. During the development of the Materiel Fielding Plan (MFP), and Materiel Fielding Agreement (MFA), the MATDEV and the materiel receiving command will identify environmental information needed to support fielding decisions. The development of generic system environmental and NEPA analyses for the system under evaluation, including military construction requirements and new equipment training issues, will be the responsibility of the MATDEV. The development of site-specific environmental analyses and NEPA documentation (EAs/EISs), using generic system environmental analyses supplied by the MATDEV, will be the responsibility of the receiving Command.</P>
                <P>(o) Army proponents are encouraged to draw upon the special expertise available within the Office of the Surgeon General (OSG) (including the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM)), and USACE District Environmental Staff to identify and evaluate environmental health impacts, and other agencies, such as USAEC, can be used to assess potential environmental impacts). In addition, other special expertise is available in the Army, DOD, other federal agencies, state and local agencies, tribes, and other organizations and individuals. Their participation and assistance is also encouraged.</P>

                <SUBJECT>NEPA analysis staffing.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) NEPA analyses will be prepared by the proponent using appropriate resources (funds and manpower). The proponent, in coordination with the appropriate NEPA program manager, shall determine what proposal requires NEPA analysis, when to initiate NEPA analysis, and what level of NEPA analysis is initially appropriate. The proponent shall remain intimately involved in determining appropriate milestones, timelines, and inputs required for the successful conduct of the NEPA process, including the use of scoping to define the breadth and depth of analysis required. In cases where the document addresses impacts to an environment whose management is not in the proponents' chain of command (for example, installation management of a range for MATDEV testing or installation management of a fielding location), the proponent shall coordinate the analysis and preparation of the document and identify the resources needed for its preparation and staffing through the command structure of that affected activity.</P>
                <P>(b) The approving official is responsible for approving NEPA documentation and ensuring completion of the action, including any mitigation actions needed. The approving official may be an installation commander; or, in the case of combat/materiel development, the MATDEV, MDA, or AAE.</P>
                <P>(c) Approving officials may select a lead reviewer for NEPA analysis before approving it. The lead reviewer will determine and assemble the personnel needed for the review process. Funding needed to accomplish the review shall be negotiated with the proponent, if required. Lead reviewer may be an installation EC or a NEPA POC designated by an MDA for a combat/materiel development program.</P>

                <P>(d) The most important document is the initial NEPA document (draft EA or draft EIS) being processed. Army reviewers are accountable for ensuring thorough early review of draft NEPA analyses. Any organization that raises new concerns or comments during final staffing will explain why issues were not raised earlier. NEPA analyses requiring public release in the FR will be forwarded to ASA(I&amp;E), through the <PRTPAGE P="294"/>chain of command, for review. This includes all EISs and all EAs that are of national interest or concern. The activities needed to support public release will be coordinated with ASA(I&amp;E). Public release will not proceed without ASA(I&amp;E) approval.</P>
                <P>(e) Public release of NEPA analyses in the FR should be limited to EISs, or EAs that are environmentally controversial or of national interest or concern. When analyses address actions affecting numerous sites throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), the proponent will carefully evaluate the need for publishing an NOA in the FR, as this requires an extensive review process, as well as supporting documentation alerting EPA and members of Congress of the action. At a minimum, and depending on the proponent's command structure, the following reviews must be accomplished:</P>
                <P>(1) The NEPA analysis must be reviewed by the MACOM Legal Counsel or TJAG, ACSIM, ASA(I&amp;E), and Office of General Counsel (OGC).</P>
                <P>(2) The supporting documentation must be reviewed by Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison (OCLL) and Office of the Chief of Public Affairs (OCPA).</P>
                <P>(3) Proponents must allow a minimum of 30 days to review the documentation and must allow sufficient time to address comments from these offices prior to publishing the NOA.</P>
                <P>(4) The proponent may consider publishing the NOA in local publication resources near each site. Proponents are strongly advised to seek the assistance of the local environmental office and command structure in addressing the need for such notification.</P>

                <P>(a) MACOMs can request delegation authority and responsibility for an EA of national concern or an EIS from ASA(I&amp;E). The proponent, through the appropriate chain of command, and with the concurrence of environmental offices, forwards to HQDA (ODEP) the request to propose, prepare, and finalize an EA and FNSI or EIS through the ROD stage. The request must include, at a minimum, the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A description of the purpose and need for the action.</P>
                <P>(2) A description of the proposed action and a preliminary list of alternatives to that proposed action, including the “no action” alternative. This constitutes the DOPAA.</P>
                <P>(3) An explanation of funding requirements, including cost estimates, and how they will be met.</P>
                <P>(4) A brief description of potential issues of concern or controversy, including any issues of potential Army-wide impact.</P>
                <P>(5) A plan for scoping and public participation.</P>
                <P>(6) A timeline, with milestones for the EIS action.</P>
                <P>(b) If granted, a formal letter will be provided by ASA(I&amp;E) outlining extent, conditions, and requirements for the NEPA action. Only the ASA(I&amp;E) can delegate this authority and responsibility. When delegated signature authority by HQDA, the MACOM will be responsible for complying with this part and associated Army environmental policy. This delegation, at the discretion of ASA(I&amp;E), can include specific authority and responsibility for coordination and staffing of:</P>
                <P>(1) EAs and FNSIs, and associated transmittal packages, as specified in § 651.35(c).</P>
                <P>(2) NOIs, Preliminary Draft EISs (PDEISs), Draft EISs (DEISs), Final EISs (FEISs), RODs and all associated transmittal packages as specified in § 651.45. Such delegation will specify requirements for coordination with ODEP and ASA (I&amp;E).</P>

Copies of EAs, and final EISs will be forwarded to AEC for cataloging and retention in the Army NEPA library. The DEIS and FEIS will be retained until the proposed action and any mitigation program is complete or the information therein is no longer valid.

                <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The NEPA process is the systematic examination of possible and probable environmental consequences of implementing a proposed action. Integration of the NEPA process with other Army projects and program planning must occur at the earliest possible time to ensure that:</P>
                <P>(1) Planning and decision-making reflect Army environmental values, such as compliance with environmental policy, laws, and regulations; and that these values are evident in Army decisions. In addition, Army decisions must reflect consideration of other requirements such as Executive Orders and other non-statutory requirements, examples of which are enumerated in § 651.14(e).</P>
                <P>(2) Army and DOD environmental policies and directives are implemented.</P>
                <P>(3) Delays and potential conflicts in the process are minimized. The public should be involved as early as possible to avoid potential delays.</P>
                <P>(b) All Army decision-making that may impact the human environment will use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that ensures the integrated use of the natural and social sciences, planning, and the environmental design arts (section 102(2)(a), Public Law 91-190, 83 Stat. 852, National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)). This approach allows timely identification of environmental effects and values in sufficient detail for concurrent evaluation with economic, technical, and mission-related analyses, early in the decision process.</P>
                <P>(c) The proponent of an action or project must identify and describe the range of reasonable alternatives to accomplish the purpose and need for the proposed action or project, taking a “hard look” at the magnitude of potential impacts of implementing the reasonable alternatives, and evaluating their significance. To assist in identifying reasonable alternatives, the proponent should consult with the installation environmental office and appropriate federal, tribal, state, and local agencies, and the general public.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Actions requiring environmental analysis.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The general types of proposed actions requiring environmental impact analysis under NEPA, unless categorically excluded or otherwise included in existing NEPA documentation, include:</P>
                <P>(a) Policies, regulations, and procedures (for example, Army and installation regulations).</P>
                <P>(b) New management and operational concepts and programs, including logistics; RDT&amp;E; procurement; personnel assignment; real property and facility management (such as master plans); and environmental programs such as Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan (INRMP), Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP), and Integrated Pest Management Plan. NEPA requirements may be incorporated into other Army plans in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.4.</P>
                <P>(c) Projects involving facilities construction.</P>
                <P>(d) Operations and activities including individual and unit training, flight operations, overall operation of installations, or facility test and evaluation programs.</P>
                <P>(e) Actions that require licenses for operations or special material use, including a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license, an Army radiation authorization, or Federal Aviation Administration air space request (new, renewal, or amendment), in accordance with AR 95-50.</P>
                <P>(f) Materiel development, operation and support, disposal, and/or modification as required by DOD 5000.2-R.</P>
                <P>(g) Transfer of significant equipment or property to the ARNG or Army Reserve.</P>
                <P>(h) Research and development including areas such as genetic engineering, laser testing, and electromagnetic pulse generation.</P>

                <P>(i) Leases, easements, permits, licenses, or other entitlement for use, to include donation, exchange, barter, or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Examples include grazing leases, grants of easement for highway right-of-way, and requests by the public to <PRTPAGE P="296"/>use land for special events such as air shows or carnivals.</P>
                <P>(j) Federal contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of funding such as Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) industrial plants or housing and construction via third-party contracting.</P>
                <P>(k) Request for approval to use or store materials, radiation sources, hazardous and toxic material, or wastes on Army land. If the requester is non-Army, the responsibility to prepare proper environmental documentation may rest with the non-Army requester, who will provide needed information for Army review. The Army must review and adopt all NEPA documentation before approving such requests.</P>
                <P>(l) Projects involving chemical weapons/munitions.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 651.11</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Environmental review categories.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following are the five broad categories into which a proposed action may fall for environmental review:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemption by law.</E> The law must apply to DOD and/or the Army and must prohibit, exempt, or make impossible full compliance with the procedures of NEPA (40 CFR 1506.11). While some aspects of Army decision-making may be exempted from NEPA, other aspects of an action are still subject to NEPA analysis and documentation. The fact that Congress has directed the Army to take an action does not constitute an exemption.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergencies.</E> In the event of an emergency, the Army will, as necessary, take immediate actions that have environmental impacts, such as those to promote national defense or security or to protect life or property, without the specific documentation and procedural requirements of other sections of this part. In such cases, at the earliest practicable time, the HQDA proponent will notify the ODEP, which in turn will notify the ASA(I&amp;E). ASA(I&amp;E) will coordinate with the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment (DUSD(IE)) and the CEQ regarding the emergency and subsequent NEPA compliance after the emergency action has been completed. These notifications apply only to actions necessary to control the immediate effects of the emergency. Other actions remain subject to NEPA review (40 CFR 1506.11). A public affairs plan should be developed to ensure open communication among the media, the public, and the installation. The Army will not delay an emergency action necessary for national defense, security, or preservation of human life or property in order to comply with this part or the CEQ regulations. However, the Army's on-site commander dealing with the emergency will consider the probable environmental consequences of proposed actions, and will minimize environmental damage to the maximum degree practicable, consistent with protecting human life, property, and national security. State call-ups of ARNG during a natural disaster or other state emergency are excluded from this notification requirement. After action reports may be required at the discretion of the ASA(I&amp;E).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Categorical Exclusions (CXs).</E> These are categories of actions that normally do not require an EA or an EIS. The Army has determined that they do not individually or cumulatively have a substantial effect on the human environment. Qualification for a CX is further described in subpart D and appendix B of this part. In accordance with § 651.29, actions that degrade the existing environment or are environmentally controversial or adversely affect environmentally sensitive resources will require an EA.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Environmental Assessment.</E> Proposed Army actions not covered in the first three categories (paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section) must be analyzed to determine if they could cause significant impacts to the human or natural environment (see § 651.39). The EA determines whether possible impacts are significant, thereby warranting an EIS. This requires a “hard look” at the magnitude of potential impacts, evaluation of their significance, and documentation in the form of either an NOI to prepare an EIS or a FNSI. The format (§ 651.34) and requirements for this analysis are addressed in subpart E of this part (see § 651.33 for actions normally requiring an EA). The <PRTPAGE P="297"/>EA is a valuable planning tool to discuss and document environmental impacts, alternatives, and controversial actions, providing public and agency participation, and identifying mitigation measures.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">EIS.</E> When an action clearly has significant impacts or when an EA cannot be concluded by a FNSI, an EIS must be prepared. An EIS is initiated by the NOI (§ 651.22), and will examine the significant environmental effects of the proposed action as well as accompanying measures to mitigate those impacts. This process requires formal interaction with the public, a formal “scoping” process, and specified timelines for public review of the documentation and the incorporation of public comments. The format and requirements for the EIS are addressed in subpart F of this part (see § 651.42 for actions normally requiring an EIS).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determining appropriate level of NEPA analysis.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The flow chart shown in Figure 1 summarizes the process for determining documentation requirements, as follows:</P>

                </GPH>
                <P>(1) If the proposed action qualifies as a CX (subpart D of this part), and the screening criteria are met (§ 651.29), the action can proceed. Some CXs require a REC.</P>
                <P>(2) If the proposed action is adequately covered within an existing EA or EIS, a REC is prepared to that effect. The REC should state the applicable EA or EIS title and date, and identify where it may be reviewed (§ 651.19, Figure 3). The REC is then attached to the proponent's record copy of that EA or EIS.</P>

                <P>(3) If the proposed action is within the general scope of an existing EA or <PRTPAGE P="299"/>EIS, but requires additional information, a supplement is prepared, considering the new, modified, or missing information. Existing documents are incorporated by reference and conclusions are published as either a FNSI or NOI to supplement the EIS.</P>
                <P>(4) If the proposed action is not covered adequately in any existing EA or EIS, or is of a significantly larger scope than that described in the existing document, an EA is prepared, followed by either a FNSI or NOI to prepare an EIS. Initiation of an EIS may proceed without first preparing an EA, if deemed appropriate by the proponent.</P>
                <P>(5) If the proposed action is not within the scope of any existing EA or EIS, then the proponent must begin the preparation of a new EA or EIS, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) The proponent of a proposed action may adopt appropriate environmental documents (EAs or EISs) prepared by another agency (40 CFR 1500.4(n) and 1506.3). In such cases, the proponent will document their use in a REC FNSI, or ROD.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Classified actions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For proposed actions and NEPA analyses involving classified information, AR 380-5 (Department of the Army Information Security Program) will be followed.</P>
                <P>(b) Classification does not relieve a proponent of the requirement to assess and document the environmental effects of a proposed action.</P>
                <P>(c) When classified information can be reasonably separated from other information and a meaningful environmental analysis produced, unclassified documents will be prepared and processed in accordance with this part. Classified portions will be kept separate and provided to reviewers and decision makers in accordance with AR 380-5.</P>
                <P>(d) When classified information is such an integral part of the analysis of a proposal that a meaningful unclassified NEPA analysis cannot be produced, the proponent, in consultation with the appropriate security and environmental offices, will form a team to review classified NEPA analysis. This interdisciplinary team will include environmental professionals to ensure that the consideration of environmental effects will be consistent with the letter and intent of NEPA, including public participation requirements for those aspects which are not classified.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Integration with Army planning.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Early integration.</E> The Army goal is to concurrently integrate environmental reviews with other Army planning and decision-making actions, thereby avoiding delays in mission accomplishment. To achieve this goal, proponents shall complete NEPA analysis as part of any recommendation or report to decision makers prior to the decision (subject to 40 CFR 1506.1). Early planning (inclusion in Installation Master Plans, INRMPs, ICRMPs, Acquisition Strategies, strategic plans, etc.) will allow efficient program or project execution later in the process.</P>
                <P>(1) The planning process will identify issues that are likely to have an effect on the environment, or to be controversial. In most cases, local citizens and/or existing advisory groups should assist in identifying potentially controversial issues during the planning process. The planning process also identifies minor issues that have little or no measurable environmental effect, and it is sound NEPA practice to reduce or eliminate discussion of minor issues to help focus analyses. Such an approach will minimize unnecessary analysis and discussion in the NEPA process and documents.</P>

                <P>(2) Decision makers will be informed of and consider the environmental consequences at the same time as other factors such as mission requirements, schedule, and cost. If permits or coordination are required (for example, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act consultation, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), etc.), they should be initiated no later than the scoping phase of the process and should run parallel to the NEPA process, not sequential to it. This practice is in accordance with the recommendations <PRTPAGE P="300"/>presented in the CEQ publication entitled “The National Environmental Policy Act: A Study of Its Effectiveness After Twenty-five Years.”</P>
                <P>(3) NEPA documentation will accompany the proposal through the Army review and decision-making processes. These documents will be forwarded to the planners, designers, and/or implementers, ensuring that the recommendations and mitigations upon which the decision was based are being carried out. The implementation process will provide necessary feedback for adaptive environmental management; responding to inaccuracies or uncertainties in the Army's ability to accurately predict impacts, changing field conditions, or unexpected results from monitoring. The integration of NEPA into the ongoing planning activities of the Army can produce considerable savings to the Army. <SU>1</SU>

                  <P>
                    <SU>1</SU> For example, a well-executed EA or EIS on an Installation Master Plan can eliminate the need for many case-by-case analyses and documentation for construction projects. After the approval of an adequate comprehensive plan (which adequately addresses the potential for environmental effects), subsequent projects can tier off of the Master Plan NEPA analysis (AR 210-20). Other integration of the NEPA process and broad-level planning can lead to the “tiering” of NEPA, allowing the proponent to minimize the effort spent on individual projects, and “incorporating by reference” the broader level environmental considerations. This tiering allows the development of program level (programmatic) EAs and EISs, which can introduce greater economies of scale. These assessments are addressed in more detail in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Time limits.</E> The timing of the preparation, circulation, submission, and public availability of NEPA documentation is important to ensure that environmental values are integrated into Army planning and decisions.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Categorical exclusions.</E> When a proposed action is categorically excluded from further environmental review (subpart D and appendix B of this part), the proponent may proceed immediately with that action upon receipt of all necessary approvals, (including local environmental office confirmation that the CX applies to the proposal) and the preparation of a REC, if required.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Findings of no significant impact.</E> (i) A proponent will make an EA and draft FNSI available to the public for review and comment for a minimum of 30 days prior to making a final decision and proceeding with an action. If the proposed action is one of national concern, is unprecedented, or normally requires an EIS (§ 651.42), the FNSI must be published in the FR. Otherwise, the FNSI must be published in local newspapers and be made widely available. The FNSI must articulate the deadline for receipt of comments, availability of the EA for review, and steps required to obtain the EA. This can include a POC, address, and phone number; a location; a reference to a website; or some equivalent mechanism. (In no cases will the only coordination mechanism be a website.) At the conclusion of the appropriate comment period, as specified in Figure 2, the decision maker may sign the FNSI and take immediate action, unless sufficient public comments are received to warrant more time for their resolution. Figure 2 follows:</P>

                  <GID>ER29MR02.001</GID>
                </GPH>
                <P>(ii) A news release is required to publicize the availability of the EA and draft FNSI, and a simultaneous announcement that includes publication in the FR must be made by HQDA, if warranted (see § 651.35 (e)). The 30-day waiting period begins at the time that the draft FNSI is publicized (40 CFR 1506.6(b)).</P>
                <P>(iii) In cases where the 30-day comment period jeopardizes the project and the full comment period would provide no public benefit, the period may be shortened with appropriate approval by a higher decision authority (such as a MACOM). In no circumstances should the public comment period for an EA/draft FNSI be less than 15 days. A deadline and POC for receipt of comments must be included in the draft FNSI and the news release.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">EIS.</E> The EPA publishes a weekly notice in the FR of the EISs filed during the preceding week. This notice usually occurs each Friday. An NOA reaching EPA on a Friday will be published in the following Friday issue of the FR. Failure to deliver an NOA to EPA by close of business on Friday will result in an additional one-week delay. A news release publicizing the action will be made in conjunction with the notice in the FR. The following time periods, calculated from the publication date of the EPA notice, will be observed:</P>
                <P>(i) Not less than 45 days for public comment on DEISs (40 CFR 1506.10(c)).</P>
                <P>(ii) Not less than 15 days for public availability of DEISs prior to any public hearing on the DEIS (40 CFR 1506(c)(2)).</P>
                <P>(iii) Not less than 90 days from filing the DEIS prior to any decision on the proposed action. These periods may run concurrently (40 CFR 1506.10(b) and (c)).</P>
                <P>(iv) The time periods prescribed here may be extended or reduced in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2) and (d).</P>
                <P>(v) When variations to these time limits are set, the Army agency should consider the factors in 40 CFR 1501.8(b)(1).</P>
                <P>(vi) The proponent may also set time limits for other procedures or decisions related to DEISs and FEISs as listed in 40 CFR 1501.8(b)(2).</P>

                <P>(vii) Because the entire EIS process could require more than one year (Figure 2 in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section), the process must begin as soon as the project is sufficiently mature to allow analysis of alternatives and the proponent must coordinate with all staff elements with a role to play in the NEPA process. DEIS preparation and response to comments constitute the largest portion of time to prepare an FEIS.<PRTPAGE P="302"/>
                </P>
                <P>(viii) A public affairs plan should be developed that provides for periodic interaction with the community. There is a minimum public review time of 90 days between the publication of the DEIS and the announcement of the ROD. After the availability of the ROD is announced, the action may proceed. This announcement must be made through the FR for those EISs for which HQDA signs the ROD. For other EISs, announcements in the local press are adequate. Figure 2 in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section indicates typical and required time periods for EISs.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Programmatic environmental review (tiering).</E> (1) Army agencies are encouraged to analyze actions at a programmatic level for those programs that are similar in nature or broad in scope (40 CFR 1502.4(c), 1502.20, and 1508.23). This level of analysis will eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and focus on the key issues at each appropriate level of project review. When a broad programmatic EA or EIS has been prepared, any subsequent EIS or EA on an action included within the entire program or policy (particularly a site-specific action) need only summarize issues discussed in the broader statement and concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent action. <SU>2</SU>
                  <FTREF/> This subsequent document will state where the earlier document is available.</P>
                <FTNT>
                  <P>
                    <SU>2</SU> As an example, an appropriate way to address diverse weapon system deployments would be to produce site-specific EAs or EISs for each major deployment installation, using the generic environmental effects of the weapon system identified in a programmatic EA or EIS prepared by the MATDEV.</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>(2) Army proponents are normally required to prepare many types of management plans that must include or be accompanied by appropriate NEPA analysis. NEPA analysis for these types of plans can often be accomplished with a programmatic approach, creating an analysis that covers a number of smaller projects or activities. In cases where such activities are adequately assessed as part of these normal planning activities, a REC can be prepared for smaller actions that cite the document in which the activities were previously assessed. Care must be taken to ensure that site-specific or case-specific conditions are adequately addressed in the existing programmatic document before a REC can be used, and the REC must reflect this consideration. If additional analyses are required, they can “tier” off the original analyses, eliminating duplication. Tiering, in this manner, is often applicable to Army actions that are long-term, multi-faceted, or multi-site.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Scoping.</E> (1) When the planning for an Army project or action indicates a need for an EIS, the proponent initiates the scoping process (see subpart G of this part for procedures and actions). This process determines the scope of issues to address in the EIS and identifies the significant issues related to the proposed action. During the scoping, process participants identify the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts to consider in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25). For an individual action, the scope may depend on the relationship of the proposed action to other NEPA documents. The scoping phase of the NEPA process, as part of project planning, will identify aspects of the proposal that are likely to have an effect or be controversial; and will ensure that the NEPA analyses are useful for a decision maker. For example, the early identification and initiation of permit or coordination actions can facilitate problem resolution, and, similarly, cumulative effects can be addressed early in the process and at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales.</P>
                <P>(2) The extent of the scoping process, including public involvement, will depend on several factors. These factors include:</P>
                <P>(i) The size and type of the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether the proposed action is of regional or national interest.</P>
                <P>(iii) Degree of any associated environmental controversy.</P>
                <P>(iv) Size of the affected environmental parameters.</P>
                <P>(v) Significance of any effects on them.</P>
                <P>(vi) Extent of prior environmental review.</P>

                <P>(vii) Involvement of any substantive time limits.<PRTPAGE P="303"/>
                </P>
                <P>(viii) Requirements by other laws for environmental review.</P>
                <P>(ix) Cumulative impacts.</P>
                <P>(3) Through scoping, many future controversies can be eliminated, and public involvement can be used to narrow the scope of the study, concentrating on those aspects of the analysis that are truly important.</P>
                <P>(4) The proponent may incorporate scoping as part of the EA process, as well. If the proponent chooses a public involvement strategy, the extent of scoping incorporated is at the proponent's discretion.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Analyses and documentation.</E> Several statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders require analyses, consultation, documentation, and coordination, which duplicate various elements and/or analyses required by NEPA and the CEQ regulations; often leading to confusion, duplication of effort, omission, and, ultimately, unnecessary cost and delay. Therefore, Army proponents are encouraged to identify, early in the NEPA process, opportunities for integrating those requirements into proposed Army programs, policies, and projects. Environmental analyses required by this part will be integrated as much as practicable with other environmental reviews, laws, and Executive Orders (40 CFR 1502.25). Incorporation of these processes must ensure that the individual requirements are met, in addition to those required by NEPA. The NEPA process does not replace the procedural or substantive requirements of other environmental statutes and regulations. Rather, it addresses them in one place so the decision maker has a concise and comprehensive view of the major environmental issues and understands the interrelationships and potential conflicts among the environmental components. NEPA is the “umbrella” that facilitates such coordination by integrating processes that might otherwise proceed independently. Prime candidates for such integration include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Clean Air Act, as amended (General Conformity Rule, 40 CFR parts 51 and 93).</P>

                <P>(f) <E T="03">Integration into Army acquisition.</E> The Army acquisition community will integrate environmental analyses into decision-making, as required in this part ensuring that environmental considerations become an integral part of total program planning and budgeting, PEOs, and Program, Product, and Project Managers integrate the NEPA process early, and acquisition planning and decisions reflect national and Army environmental values and considerations. By integrating pollution prevention and other aspects of any environmental analysis early into the materiel acquisition process, the PEO and PM facilitate the identification of environmental cost drivers at a time when they can be most effectively controlled. NEPA program coordinators should refer to DA Pamphlet 70-3, Army Acquisition Procedures, and the Defense Acquisition Deskbook (DAD) for current specific implementation guidance, procedures, and POCs.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Relations with local, state, regional, and tribal agencies.</E> (1) Army installation, agency, or activity environmental officers or planners should establish a continuing relationship with other agencies, including the staffs of adjacent local, state, regional, and tribal governments and agencies. This relationship will promote cooperation and resolution of mutual land use and environment-related problems, and promote the concept of regional ecosystem management as well as general cooperative problem solving. Many of these “partners” will have specialized expertise and access to environmental baseline data, which will assist the Army in day-to-day planning as well as NEPA-related issues. MOUs are encouraged to identify areas of mutual interest, establish POCs, identify lines of communication between agencies, and specify procedures to follow in conflict resolution. Additional coordination is available from state and area-wide planning and development agencies. Through this process, the proponent may gain insights on other agencies' approaches to EAs, surveys, and studies applicable to the current proposal. These other agencies would also be able to assist in identifying possible participants in scoping procedures for projects requiring an EIS.</P>

                <P>(2) In some cases, local, state, regional, or tribal governments or agencies will have sufficient jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to reasonable alternatives or significant environmental, social, or economic impacts associated with a proposed action. When appropriate, proponents of an action should determine whether these entities have an interest in becoming a cooperating agency (§ 651.45 (b) and 40 CFR 1501.6). If cooperating agency status is established, a memorandum of agreement is required to document specific expectations, roles, and responsibilities, including analyses to be performed, time schedules, availability of pre-decisional information, and other issues. Cooperating agencies may use their own funds, and the designation of cooperating agency status <PRTPAGE P="305"/>neither enlarges nor diminishes the decision-making status of any federal or non-federal entities (see CEQ Memorandum for Heads of Federal Agencies entitled “Designation of Non-Federal Agencies to be Cooperating Agencies in Implementing the Procedural Requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act” dated 28 July 1999, available from the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), Executive Office of the President of the U.S.). In determining sufficient jurisdiction or expertise, CEQ regulations can be used as guidance.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">The Army as a cooperating agency.</E> Often, other agencies take actions that can negatively impact the Army mission. In such cases, the Army may have some special or unique expertise or jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(1) The Army may be a cooperating agency (40 CFR 1501.6) in order to:</P>
                <P>(i) Provide information or technical expertise to a lead agency.</P>
                <P>(ii) Approve portions of a proposed action.</P>
                <P>(iii) Ensure the Army has an opportunity to be involved in an action of another federal agency that will affect the Army.</P>
                <P>(iv) Provide review and approval of the portions of EISs and RODs that affect the Army.</P>
                <P>(2) Adequacy of an EIS is primarily the responsibility of the lead agency. However, as a cooperating agency with approval authority over portions of a proposal, the Army may adopt an EIS if review concludes the EIS adequately satisfies the Army's comments and suggestions.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Army is a major approval authority for the proposed action, the appropriate Army official may sign the ROD prepared by the lead agency, or prepare a separate, more focused ROD. If the Army's approval authority is only a minor aspect of the overall proposal, such as issuing a temporary use permit, the Army need not sign the lead agency's ROD or prepare a separate ROD.</P>
                <P>(4) The magnitude of the Army's involvement in the proposal will determine the appropriate level and scope of Army review of NEPA documents. If the Army is a major approval authority or may be severely impacted by the proposal or an alternative, the Army should undertake the same level of review as if it were the lead agency. If the involvement is limited, the review may be substantially less. The lead agency is responsible for overall supervision of the EIS, and the Army will attempt to meet all reasonable time frames imposed by the lead agency.</P>
                <P>(5) If an installation (or other Army organization) should become aware of an EIS being prepared by another federal agency in which they may be involved within the discussion of the document, they should notify ASA(I&amp;E) through the chain of command. ASA(I&amp;E) will advise regarding appropriate Army participation as a cooperating agency, which may simply involve local coordination.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Mitigation and monitoring.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Throughout the environmental analysis process, the proponent will consider mitigation measures to avoid or minimize environmental harm. Mitigation measures include:</P>
                <P>(1) Avoiding the impact altogether, by eliminating the action or parts of the action.</P>
                <P>(2) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation.</P>
                <P>(3) Rectifying the impact; by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the adverse effect on the environment.</P>
                <P>(4) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time, by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.</P>
                <P>(5) Compensating for the impact, by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments. (Examples and further clarification are presented in appendix C of this part.)</P>

                <P>(b) When the analysis proceeds to an EA or EIS, mitigation measures will be clearly assessed and those selected for implementation will be identified in the FNSI or the ROD. The proponent must implement those identified mitigations, because they are commitments made as part of the Army decision. The proponent is responsible for responding to inquiries from the public or other agencies regarding the status of mitigation measures adopted in the NEPA process. The mitigation shall become a line item in the proponent's <PRTPAGE P="306"/>budget or other funding document, if appropriate, or included in the legal document implementing the action (for example, contracts, leases, or grants). Only those practical mitigation measures that can reasonably be accomplished as part of a proposed alternative will be identified. Any mitigation measures selected by the proponent will be clearly outlined in the NEPA decision document, will be budgeted and funded (or funding arranged) by the proponent, and will be identified, with the appropriate fund code, in the EPR (AR 200-1). Mitigations will be monitored through environmental compliance reporting, such as the ISR (AR 200-1) or the Environmental Quality Report. Mitigation measures are identified and funded in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, or other media area requirements.</P>
                <P>(c) Based upon the analysis and selection of mitigation measures that reduce environmental impacts until they are no longer significant, an EA may result in a FNSI. If a proponent uses mitigation measures in such a manner, the FNSI must identify these mitigating measures, and they become legally binding and must be accomplished as the project is implemented. If any of these identified mitigation measures do not occur, so that significant adverse environmental effects could reasonably expected to result, the proponent must publish an NOI and prepare an EIS.</P>
                <P>(d) Potential mitigation measures that appear practical, and are unobtainable within expected Army resources, or that some other agency (including non-Army agencies) should perform, will be identified in the NEPA analysis to the maximum extent practicable. A number of factors determine what is practical, including military mission, manpower restrictions, cost, institutional barriers, technical feasibility, and public acceptance. Practicality does not necessarily ensure resolution of conflicts among these items, rather it is the degree of conflict that determines practicality. Although mission conflicts are inevitable, they are not necessarily insurmountable; and the proponent should be cautious about declaring all mitigations impractical and carefully consider any manpower requirements. The key point concerning both the manpower and cost constraints is that, unless money is actually budgeted and manpower assigned, the mitigation does not exist. Coordination by the proponent early in the process will be required to allow ample time to get the mitigation activities into the budget cycle. The project cannot be undertaken until all required mitigation efforts are fully resourced, or until the lack of funding and resultant effects, are fully addressed in the NEPA analysis.</P>
                <P>(e) Mitigation measures that were considered but rejected, including those that can be accomplished by other agencies, must be discussed, along with the reason for the rejection, within the EA or EIS. If they occur in an EA, their rejection may lead to an EIS, if the resultant unmitigated impacts are significant.</P>
                <P>(f) Proponents may request assistance with mitigation from cooperating non-Army agencies, when appropriate. Such assistance is appropriate when the requested agency was a cooperating agency during preparation of a NEPA document, or has the technology, expertise, time, funds, or familiarity with the project or the local ecology necessary to implement the mitigation measure more effectively than the lead agency.</P>
                <P>(g) The proponent agency or other appropriate cooperating agency will implement mitigations and other conditions established in the EA or EIS, or commitments made in the FNSI or ROD. Legal documents implementing the action (such as contracts, permits, grants) will specify mitigation measures to be performed. Penalties against a contractor for noncompliance may also be specified as appropriate. Specification of penalties should be fully coordinated with the appropriate legal advisor.</P>

                <P>(h) A monitoring and enforcement program for any mitigation will be adopted and summarized in the NEPA documentation (see appendix C of this part for guidelines on implementing such a program). Whether adoption of a monitoring and enforcement program is applicable (40 CFR 1505.2(c)) and <PRTPAGE P="307"/>whether the specific adopted action requires monitoring (40 CFR 1505.3) may depend on the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A change in environmental conditions or project activities assumed in the EIS (such that original predictions of the extent of adverse environmental impacts may be too limited);</P>
                <P>(2) The outcome of the mitigation measure is uncertain (for example, new technology);</P>
                <P>(3) Major environmental controversy remains associated with the selected alternative; or</P>
                <P>(4) Failure of a mitigation measure, or other unforeseen circumstances, could result in a failure to meet achievement of requirements (such as adverse effects on federal or state listed endangered or threatened species, important historic or archaeological sites that are either listed or eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, or other public or private protected resources). Proponents must follow local installation environmental office procedures to coordinate with appropriate federal, tribal, state, or local agencies responsible for a particular program to determine what would constitute “adverse effects.”</P>
                <P>(i) Monitoring is an integral part of any mitigation system.</P>
                <P>(1) Enforcement monitoring ensures that mitigation is being performed as described in the NEPA documentation, mitigation requirements and penalty clauses are written into any contracts, and required provisions are enforced. The development of an enforcement monitoring program is governed by who will actually perform the mitigation: a contractor, a cooperating agency, or an in-house (Army) lead agency. Detailed guidance is contained in Appendix C of this part. The proponent is ultimately responsible for performing any mitigation activities. All monitoring results will be sent to the installation Environmental Office; in the case of the Army Reserves, the Regional Support Commands (RSCs); and, in the case of the National Guard, the NGB.</P>
                <P>(2) Effectiveness monitoring measures the success of the mitigation effort and/or the environmental effect. While quantitative measurements are desired, qualitative measures may be required. The objective is to obtain enough information to judge the effect of the mitigation. In establishing the monitoring system, the responsible agent should coordinate the monitoring with the Environmental Office. Specific steps and guidelines are included in appendix C of this part.</P>
                <P>(j) The monitoring program, in most cases, should be established well before the action begins, particularly when biological variables are being measured and investigated. At this stage, any necessary contracts, funding, and manpower assignments must be initiated. Technical results from the analysis should be summarized by the proponent and coordinated with the installation Environmental Office. Subsequent coordination with the concerned public and other agencies, as arranged through development of the mitigation plan, will be handled through the Environmental Office.</P>
                <P>(k) If the mitigations are effective, the monitoring should be continued as long as the mitigations are needed to address impacts of the initial action. If the mitigations are ineffective, the proponent and the responsible group should re-examine the mitigation measures, in consultation with the Environmental Office and appropriate experts, and resolve the inadequacies of the mitigation or monitoring. Professionals with specialized and recognized expertise in the topic or issue, as well as concerned citizens, are essential to the credibility of this review. If a different program is required, then a new system must be established. If ineffective mitigations are identified which were required to reduce impact below significance levels (§ 651.35 (g)), the proponent may be required to publish an NOI and prepare an EIS (paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Environmental monitoring report.</E> An environmental monitoring report is prepared at one or more points after program or action execution. Its purpose is to determine the accuracy of impact predictions. It can serve as the basis for adjustments in mitigation programs and to adjust impact predictions in future projects.

                <SUBJECT>Cumulative impacts.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) NEPA analyses must assess cumulative effects, which are the impact on the environment resulting from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Actions by federal, non-federal agencies, and private parties must be considered (40 CFR 1508.7).</P>
                <P>(b) The scoping process should be used to identify possible cumulative impacts. The proponent should also contact appropriate off-post officials, such as tribal, state, county, or local planning officials, to identify other actions that should be considered in the cumulative effects analysis.</P>
                <P>(c) A suggested cumulative effects approach is as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Identify the boundary of each resource category. Boundaries may be geographic or temporal. For example, the Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) might be the appropriate boundary for the air quality analysis, while a watershed could be the boundary for the water quality analysis. Depending upon the circumstances, these boundaries could be different and could extend off the installation.</P>
                <P>(2) Describe the threshold level of significance for that resource category. For example, a violation of air quality standards within the AQCR would be an appropriate threshold level.</P>
                <P>(3) Determine the environmental consequence of the action. The analysis should identify the cause and effect relationships, determine the magnitude and significance of cumulative effects, and identify possible mitigation measures.</P>

                <P>A Record of Environmental Consideration (REC) is a signed statement submitted with project documentation that briefly documents that an Army action has received environmental review. RECs are prepared for CXs that require them, and for actions covered by existing or previous NEPA documentation. A REC briefly describes the proposed action and timeframe, identifies the proponent and approving official(s), and clearly shows how an action qualifies for a CX, or is already covered in an existing EA or EIS. When used to support a CX, the REC must address the use of screening criteria to ensure that no extraordinary circumstances or situations exist. A REC has no prescribed format, as long as the above information is included. To reduce paperwork, a REC can reference such documents as real estate Environmental Baseline Studies (EBSs) and other documents, as long as they are readily available for review. While a REC may document compliance with the requirements of NEPA, it does not fulfill the requirements of other environmental laws and regulations. Figure 3 illustrates a possible format for the REC as follows:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Environmental assessment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>An EA is intended to assist agency planning and decision-making. While required to assess environmental impacts and evaluate their significance, it is routinely used as a planning document to evaluate environmental impacts, develop alternatives and mitigation measures, and allow for agency and public participation. It:</P>
                <P>(a) Briefly provides the decision maker with sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether a FNSI or an EIS should be prepared.</P>
                <P>(b) Assures compliance with NEPA, if an EIS is not required and a CX is inappropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Facilitates preparation of an EIS, if required.</P>
                <P>(d) Includes brief discussions of the need for the proposed action, alternatives to the proposed action (NEPA, section 102(2)(e)), environmental impacts, and a listing of persons and agencies consulted (see subpart E of this part for requirements).</P>
                <P>(e) The EA provides the proponent, the public, and the decision maker with sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether environmental impacts of a proposed action are potentially significant. An EA is substantially less rigorous and costly than an EIS, but requires sufficient detail to identify and ascertain the significance of expected impacts associated with the proposed action and its alternatives. The EA can often provide the required “hard look” at the potential environmental effects of an action, program, or policy within 1 to 25 pages, depending upon the nature of the action and project-specific conditions.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Finding of no significant impact.</SUBJECT>

                <P>A Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) is a document that briefly states why an action (not otherwise excluded) will not significantly affect the environment, and, therefore, that an EIS will not be prepared. The FNSI includes a summary of the EA and notes any related NEPA documentation. If the EA is attached, the FNSI need not repeat any of the EA discussion, but may incorporate it by reference. The draft FNSI will be made available to the public for review and comment for <PRTPAGE P="310"/>30 days prior to the initiation of an action, except in special circumstances when the public comment period is reduced to 15 days, as discussed in § 651.14(b)(2)(iii). Following the comment period and review of public comments, the proponent forwards a decision package that includes a comparison of environmental impacts associated with reasonable alternatives, summary of public concerns, revised FNSI (if necessary), and recommendations for the decision maker. The decision maker reviews the package, makes a decision, and signs the FNSI or the NOI (if the FNSI no longer applies). If a FNSI is signed by the decision maker, the action can proceed immediately.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determining when to use a CX (screening criteria).</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) To use a CX, the proponent must satisfy the following three screening conditions:</P>
                <P>(1) The action has not been segmented. Determine that the action has not been segmented to meet the definition of a CX. Segmentation can occur when an action is broken down into small parts in order to avoid the appearance of significance of the total action. An action can be too narrowly defined, minimizing potential impacts in an effort to avoid a higher level of NEPA documentation. The scope of an action must include the consideration of connected, cumulative, and similar actions (see § 651.51(a)).</P>
                <P>(2) No exceptional circumstances exist. Determine if the action involves extraordinary circumstances that would preclude the use of a CX (see paragraphs (b) (1) through (14) of this section).</P>
                <P>(3) One (or more) CX encompasses the proposed action. Identify a CX (or multiple CXs) that potentially encompasses the proposed action (Appendix B of this part). If no CX is appropriate, and the project is not exempted by statute or emergency provisions, an EA or an EIS must be prepared, before a proposed action may proceed.</P>
                <P>(b) Extraordinary circumstances that preclude the use of a CX are:</P>
                <P>(1) Reasonable likelihood of significant effects on public health, safety, or the environment.</P>
                <P>(2) Reasonable likelihood of significant environmental effects (direct, indirect, and cumulative).</P>
                <P>(3) Imposition of uncertain or unique environmental risks.</P>
                <P>(4) Greater scope or size than is normal for this category of action.</P>
                <P>(5) Reportable releases of hazardous or toxic substances as specified in 40 CFR part 302, Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification.</P>
                <P>(6) Releases of petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) except from a properly functioning engine or vehicle, application of pesticides and herbicides, or where the proposed action results in the requirement to develop or amend a Spill Prevention, Control, or Countermeasures Plan.</P>
                <P>(7) When a review of an action that might otherwise qualify for a Record of Non-applicability (RONA) reveals that air emissions exceed de minimis levels or otherwise that a formal Clean Air Act conformity determination is required.</P>
                <P>(8) Reasonable likelihood of violating any federal, state, or local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.</P>
                <P>(9) Unresolved effect on environmentally sensitive resources, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(10) Involving effects on the quality of the environment that are likely to be highly controversial.</P>
                <P>(11) Involving effects on the environment that are highly uncertain, involve unique or unknown risks, or are scientifically controversial.</P>
                <P>(12) Establishes a precedent (or makes decisions in principle) for future or subsequent actions that are reasonably likely to have a future significant effect.</P>
                <P>(13) Potential for degradation of already existing poor environmental conditions. Also, initiation of a degrading influence, activity, or effect in areas not already significantly modified from their natural condition.</P>
                <P>(14) Introduction/employment of unproven technology.</P>
                <P>(c) If a proposed action would adversely affect “environmentally sensitive” resources, unless the impact has been resolved through another environmental process (e.g., CZMA, NHPA, CWA, etc.) a CX cannot be used (see paragraph (e) of this section). Environmentally sensitive resources include:</P>
                <P>(1) Proposed federally listed, threatened, or endangered species or their designated critical habitats.</P>
                <P>(2) Properties listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (AR 200-4).</P>

                <P>(3) Areas having special designation or recognition such as prime or unique <PRTPAGE P="312"/>agricultural lands; coastal zones; designated wilderness or wilderness study areas; wild and scenic rivers; National Historic Landmarks (designated by the Secretary of the Interior); 100-year floodplains; wetlands; sole source aquifers (potential sources of drinking water); National Wildlife Refuges; National Parks; areas of critical environmental concern; or other areas of high environmental sensitivity.</P>
                <P>(4) Cultural Resources as defined in AR 200-4.</P>
                <P>(d) The use of a CX does not relieve the proponent from compliance with other statutes, such as RCRA, or consultations under the Endangered Species Act or the NHPA. Such consultations may be required to determine the applicability of the CX screening criteria.</P>
                <P>(e) For those CXs that require a REC, a brief (one to two sentence) presentation of conclusions reached during screening is required in the REC. This determination can be made using current information and expertise, if available and adequate, or can be derived through conversation, as long as the basis for the determination is included in the REC. Copies of appropriate interagency correspondence can be attached to the REC. Example conclusions regarding screening criteria are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) “USFWS concurred in informal coordination that E/T species will not be affected”.</P>
                <P>(2) “Corps of Engineers determined action is covered by nationwide general permit”.</P>
                <P>(3) “SHPO concurred with action”.</P>
                <P>(4) “State Department of Natural Resources concurred that no effect to state sensitive species is expected”.</P>

                <P>(a) An EA is intended to facilitate agency planning and informed decision-making, helping proponents and other decision makers understand the potential extent of environmental impacts of a proposed action and its alternatives, and whether those impacts (or cumulative impacts) are significant. The EA can aid in Army compliance with NEPA when no EIS is necessary. An EA will be prepared if a proposed action:</P>
                <P>(1) Is not an emergency (§ 651.11(b)).</P>
                <P>(2) Is not exempt from (or an exception to) NEPA (§ 651.11(a)).</P>
                <P>(3) Does not qualify as a CX (§ 651.11(c)).</P>
                <P>(4) Is not adequately covered by existing NEPA analysis and documentation (§ 651.19).</P>
                <P>(5) Does not normally require an EIS (§ 651.42).</P>
                <P>(b) An EA can be 1 to 25 pages in length and be adequate to meet the requirements of this part, depending upon site-specific circumstances and conditions. Any analysis that exceeds 25 pages in length should be evaluated to consider whether the action and its effects are significant and thus warrant an EIS.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Actions normally requiring an EA.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following Army actions normally require an EA, unless they qualify for the use of a CX:</P>
                <P>(a) Special field training exercises or test activities in excess of five acres on Army land of a nature or magnitude not within the annual installation training cycle or installation master plan.</P>

                <P>(b) Military construction that exceeds five contiguous acres, including contracts for off-post construction.<PRTPAGE P="313"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) Changes to established installation land use that generate impacts on the environment.</P>
                <P>(d) Alteration projects affecting historically significant structures, archaeological sites, or places listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</P>
                <P>(e) Actions that could cause significant increase in soil erosion, or affect prime or unique farmland (off Army property), wetlands, floodplains, coastal zones, wilderness areas, aquifers or other water supplies, prime or unique wildlife habitat, or wild and scenic rivers.</P>
                <P>(f) Actions proposed during the life cycle of a weapon system if the action produces a new hazardous or toxic material or results in a new hazardous or toxic waste, and the action is not adequately addressed by existing NEPA documentation. Examples of actions normally requiring an EA during the life cycle include, but are not limited to, testing, production, fielding, and training involving natural resources, and disposal/demilitarization. System design, development, and production actions may require an EA, if such decisions establish precedent (or make decisions, in principle) for future actions with potential environmental effects. Such actions should be carefully considered in cooperation with the development or production contractor or government agency, and NEPA analysis may be required.</P>
                <P>(g) Development and approval of installation master plans.</P>
                <P>(h) Development and implementation of Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans (INRMPs) (land, forest, fish, and wildlife) and Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plans (ICRMPs).</P>
                <P>(i) Actions that take place in, or adversely affect, important wildlife habitats, including wildlife refuges.</P>
                <P>(j) Field activities on land not controlled by the military, except those that do not alter land use to substantially change the environment (for example, patrolling activities in a forest). This includes firing of weapons, missiles, or lasers over navigable waters of the United States, or extending 45 meters or more above ground level into the national airspace. It also includes joint air attack training that may require participating aircraft to exceed 250 knots at altitudes below 3000 feet above ground level, and helicopters, at any speed, below 500 feet above ground level.</P>
                <P>(k) An action with substantial adverse local or regional effects on energy or water availability. Such impacts can only be adequately identified with input from local agencies and/or citizens.</P>
                <P>(l) Production of hazardous or toxic materials.</P>
                <P>(m) Changes to established airspace use that generate impacts on the environment or socioeconomic systems, or create a hazard to non-participants.</P>
                <P>(n) An installation pesticide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, and rodenticide-use program/plan.</P>
                <P>(o) Acquisition, construction, or alteration of (or space for) a laboratory that will use hazardous chemicals, drugs, or biological or radioactive materials.</P>
                <P>(p) An activity that affects a federally listed threatened or endangered plant or animal species, a federal candidate species, a species proposed for federal listing, or critical habitat.</P>
                <P>(q) Substantial proposed changes in Army-wide doctrine or policy that potentially have an adverse effect on the environment (40 CFR 1508.18 (b)(1)).</P>
                <P>(r) An action that may threaten a violation of federal, state, or local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.</P>
                <P>(s) The construction and operation of major new fixed facilities or the substantial commitment of installation natural resources supporting new materiel at the installation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>EA components.</SUBJECT>
                <P>EAs should be 1 to 25 pages in length, and will include:</P>
                <P>(a) Signature (Review and Approval) page.</P>
                <P>(b) Purpose and need for the action.</P>
                <P>(c) Description of the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternatives considered.</E> The alternatives considered, including appropriate consideration of the “No Action” alternative, the “Proposed Action,” and all other appropriate and <PRTPAGE P="314"/>reasonable alternatives that can be realistically accomplished. In the discussion of alternatives, any criteria for screening alternatives from full consideration should be presented, and the final disposition of any alternatives that were initially identified should be discussed.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Affected environment.</E> This section must address the general conditions and nature of the affected environment and establish the environmental setting against which environmental effects are evaluated. This should include any relevant general baseline conditions focusing on specific aspects of the environment that may be impacted by the alternatives. EBSs and similar real estate or construction environmental baseline documents, or their equivalent, may be incorporated and/or referenced.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Environmental consequences.</E> Environmental consequences of the proposed action and the alternatives. The document must state and assess the effects (direct, indirect, and cumulative) of the proposed action and its alternatives on the environment, and what practical mitigation is available to minimize these impacts. Discussion and comparison of impacts should provide sufficient analysis to reach a conclusion regarding the significance of the impacts, and is not merely a quantification of facts.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Conclusions regarding the impacts of the proposed action.</E> A clear statement will be provided regarding whether or not the described impacts are significant. If the EA identifies potential significant impacts associated with the proposed action, the conclusion should clearly state that an EIS will be prepared before the proposed action is implemented. If no significant impacts are associated with the project, the conclusion should state that a FNSI will be prepared. Any mitigations that reduce adverse impacts must be clearly presented. If the EA depends upon mitigations to support a resultant FNSI, these mitigations must be clearly identified as a subsection of the Conclusions.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Listing of preparers, and agencies and persons consulted.</E> Copies of correspondence to and from agencies and persons contacted during the preparation of the EA will be available in the administrative record and may be included in the EA as appendices. In addition, the list of analysts/preparers will be presented.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">References.</E> These provide bibliographic information for cited sources. Draft documents should not be cited as references without the expressed permission of the proponent of the draft material.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 651.35</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Decision process.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An EA results in either a FNSI or an NOI to prepare an EIS. Initiation of an NOI to prepare an EIS should occur at any time in the decision process when it is determined that significant effects may occur as a result of the proposed action. The proponent should notify the decision maker of any such determination as soon as possible.</P>
                <P>(b) The FNSI is a document (40 CFR 1508.13) that briefly states why an action (not otherwise excluded) will not significantly affect the environment, and, therefore, an EIS will not be prepared. It summarizes the EA, noting any NEPA documents that are related to, but are not part of, the scope of the EA under consideration. If the EA is attached, the FNSI may incorporate the EA's discussion by reference. The draft FNSI will be made available to the public for review and comment for 30 days prior to the initiation of an action (see § 651.14(b)(2)(iii) for an exception). Following the comment period, the decision maker signs the FNSI, and the action can proceed. It is important that the final FNSI reflect the decision made, the response to public comments, and the basis for the final decision.</P>
                <P>(c) The FNSI must contain the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The name of the action.</P>
                <P>(2) A brief description of the action (including any alternatives considered).</P>
                <P>(3) A short discussion of the anticipated environmental effects.</P>
                <P>(4) The facts and conclusions that have led to the FNSI.</P>
                <P>(5) A deadline and POC for further information or receipt of public comments (see § 651.47).</P>

                <P>(d) The FNSI is normally no more than two typewritten pages in length.<PRTPAGE P="315"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) The draft FNSI will be made available to the public prior to initiation of the proposed action, unless it is a classified action (see § 651.13 for security exclusions). Draft FNSIs that have national interest should be submitted with the proposed press release, along with a Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A) package, through command channels to ASA(I&amp;E) for approval and subsequent publication in the FR. Draft FNSIs having national interest will be coordinated with OCPA. Local publication of the FNSI will not precede the FR publication. The text of the publication should be identical to the FR publication.</P>
                <P>(f) For actions of only regional or local interest, the draft FNSI will be publicized in accordance with § 651.14(b)(2). Distribution of the draft FNSI should include any agencies, organizations, and individuals that have expressed interest in the project, those who may be affected, and others deemed appropriate.</P>
                <P>(g) Some FNSIs will require the implementation of mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts below significance levels, thereby eliminating the requirement for an EIS. In such instances, the following steps must be taken:</P>
                <P>(1) The EA must be made readily available to the public for review through traditional publication and distribution, and through the World Wide Web (WWW) or similar technology. This distribution must be planned to ensure that all appropriate entities and stakeholders have easy access to the material. Ensuring this availability may necessitate the distribution of printed information at locations that are readily accessible and frequented by those who are affected or interested.</P>
                <P>(2) Any identified mitigations must be tracked to ensure implementation, similar to those specified in an EIS and ROD.</P>
                <P>(3) The EA analysis procedures must be sufficiently rigorous to identify and analyze impacts that are individually or cumulatively significant.</P>
                <P>(h) The proponent is responsible for funding the preparation, staffing, and distribution of the draft FNSI and EA package, and the incorporation of public/agency review and comment. The proponent shall also ensure appropriate public and agency meetings, which may be required to facilitate the NEPA process in completing the EA. The decision maker will approve and sign the EA and FNSI documents. Proponents will ensure that the EA and FNSI, to include drafts, are provided in electronic format to allow for maximum information flow throughout the process.</P>
                <P>(i) The proponent should ensure that the decision maker is continuously informed of key findings during the EA process, particularly with respect to potential impacts and controversy related to the proposed action.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Public involvement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The involvement of other agencies, organizations, and individuals in the development of EAs and EISs enhances collaborative issue identification and problem solving. Such involvement demonstrates that the Army is committed to open decision-making and builds the necessary community trust that sustains the Army in the long term. Public involvement is mandatory for EISs (see § 651.47 and Appendix D of this part for information on public involvement requirements).</P>
                <P>(b) Environmental agencies and the public will be involved to the extent practicable in the preparation of an EA. If the proponent elects to involve the public in the development of an EA, § 651.47 and Appendix D of this part may be used as guidance. When considering the extent practicable of public interaction (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), factors to be weighed include:</P>
                <P>(1) Magnitude of the proposed project/action.</P>
                <P>(2) Extent of anticipated public interest, based on experience with similar proposals.</P>
                <P>(3) Urgency of the proposal.</P>
                <P>(4) National security classification.</P>
                <P>(5) The presence of minority or economically-disadvantaged populations.</P>

                <P>(c) Public involvement must begin early in the proposal development stage, and during preparation of an EA. The direct involvement of agencies with jurisdiction or special expertise is an integral part of impact analysis, <PRTPAGE P="316"/>and provides information and conclusions for incorporation into EAs. Unclassified documents incorporated by reference into the EA or FNSI are public documents.</P>
                <P>(d) Copies of public notices, “scoping” letters, EAs, draft FNSIs, FNSIs, and other documents routinely sent to the public will be sent directly to appropriate congressional, state, and district offices.</P>
                <P>(e) To ensure early incorporation of the public into the process, a plan to include all interested or affected parties should be developed at the beginning of the analysis and documentation process. Open communication with the public is encouraged as a matter of Army policy, and the degree of public involvement varies. Appropriate public notice of the availability of the completed EA/draft FNSI shall be made (see § 651.35) (see also AR 360-5 (Public Information)). The plan will include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Dissemination of information to local and installation communities.</P>
                <P>(2) Invitation and incorporation of public comments on Army actions.</P>
                <P>(3) Consultation with appropriate persons and agencies.</P>
                <P>(f) Further guidance on public participation requirements (to potentially be used for EAs and EISs, depending on circumstances) is presented in Appendix D of this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Public availability.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Documents incorporated into the EA or FNSI by reference will be available for public review. Where possible, use of public libraries and a list of POCs for supportive documents is encouraged. A depository should be chosen which is open beyond normal business hours. To the extent possible, the WWW should also be used to increase public availability of documents.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Existing environmental assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>EAs are dynamic documents. To ensure that the described setting, actions, and effects remain substantially accurate, the proponent or installation Environmental Officer is encouraged to periodically review existing documentation that is still relevant or supporting current action. If an action is not yet completed, substantial changes in the proposed action may require supplementation, as specified in § 651.5 (g).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Significance.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If the proposed action may or will result in significant impacts to the environment, an EIS is prepared to provide more comprehensive analyses and conclusions about the impacts. Significant impacts of socioeconomic consequence alone do not merit an EIS.</P>
                <P>(b) Significance of impacts is determined by examining both the context and intensity of the proposed action (40 CFR 1508.27). The analysis should establish, by resource category, the threshold at which significance is reached. For example, an action that would violate existing pollution standards; cause water, air, noise, soil, or underground pollution; impair visibility for substantial periods; or cause irreparable harm to animal or plant life could be determined significant. Significant beneficial effects also occur and must be addressed, if applicable.</P>
                <P>(c) The proponent should use appropriate methods to identify and ascertain the “significance” of impacts. The use of simple analytical tools, which are subject to independent peer review, fully documented, and available to the public, is encouraged. <SU>4</SU>
                  <FTREF/> In particular, where impacts are unknown or are suspected to be of public interest, public involvement should be initiated early in the EA (scoping) process.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) An EIS is a public document designed to ensure that NEPA policies and goals are incorporated early into the programs and actions of federal agencies. An EIS is intended to provide a full, open, and balanced discussion of significant environmental impacts that <PRTPAGE P="317"/>may result from a proposed action and alternatives, allowing public review and comment on the proposal and providing a basis for informed decision-making.</P>
                <P>(b) The NEPA process should support sound, informed, and timely (early) decision-making; not produce encyclopedic documents. CEQ guidance (40 CFR 1502.7) should be followed, establishing a page limit of 150 pages (300 pages for complex projects). To the extent practicable, EISs will “incorporate by reference” any material that is reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed for comment. The incorporated material shall be cited in the EIS and its content will be briefly described. Material based on proprietary data, that is itself not available for review and comment, shall not be incorporated by reference.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Conditions requiring an EIS.</SUBJECT>
                <P>An EIS is required when a proponent, preparer, or approving authority determines that the proposed action has the potential to:</P>
                <P>(a) Significantly affect environmental quality, or public health or safety.</P>

                <P>(a) If the incomplete information relevant to reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, the Army will include the information in the EIS.</P>
                <P>(b) If the information relevant to reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts cannot be obtained because the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known (for example, the means for obtaining it are beyond the state of the art), the proponent will include in the EIS:</P>
                <P>(1) A statement that such information is incomplete or unavailable.</P>
                <P>(2) A statement of the relevance of the incomplete or unavailable information to evaluating the reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment.</P>
                <P>(3) A summary of existing credible scientific evidence that is relevant to evaluating the reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment.</P>
                <P>(4) An evaluation of such impacts based upon theoretical approaches or research methods generally accepted in the scientific community.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Steps in preparing and processing an EIS.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">NOI.</E> The NOI initiates the formal scoping process and is prepared by the proponent.</P>
                <P>(1) Prior to preparing an EIS, an NOI will be published in the FR and in newspapers with appropriate or general circulation in the areas potentially affected by the proposed action. The OCLL will be notified by the ARSTAF proponent of pending EISs so that congressional coordination may be effected. After the NOI is published in the FR, copies of the notice may also be distributed to agencies, organizations, and individuals, as the responsible official deems appropriate.</P>
                <P>(2) The NOI transmittal package includes the NOI, the press release, information for Members of Congress, memorandum for correspondents, and a “questions and answers” (Q&amp;A) package. The NOI shall clearly state the proposed action and alternatives, and state why the action may have unknown and/or significant environmental impacts.</P>
                <P>(3) The proponent forwards the NOI and the transmittal package to the appropriate HQDA (ARSTAF) proponent for coordination and staffing prior to publication. The ARSTAF proponent will coordinate the NOI with HQDA (ODEP), OCLL, TJAG, OGC, OCPA, relevant MACOMs, and others). Only the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (DASA(ESOH)) can authorize release of an NOI to the FR for publication, unless that authority has been delegated. A cover letter (similar to Figure 5 in § 651.46) will accompany the NOI. An example NOI is shown in Figure 6 in § 651.46.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Lead and cooperating agency determination.</E> As soon as possible after the decision is made to prepare an EIS, the proponent will contact appropriate federal, tribal, state, and local agencies to identify lead or cooperating agency responsibilities concerning EIS preparation. At this point, a public affairs plan must be developed. In the case of State ARNG actions that have federal funding, the NGB will be the lead agency for the purpose of federal compliance with NEPA. The State may be either a <PRTPAGE P="319"/>joint lead or a cooperating agency, as determined by NGB.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Scoping.</E> The proponent will begin the scoping process described in § 651.48. Portions of the scoping process may take place prior to publication of the NOI.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">DEIS preparation and processing.</E> Prior to publication of a DEIS, the proponent can prepare a PDEIS, allowing for internal organization and the resolution of internal Army consideration, prior to a formal request for comments.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">PDEIS.</E> Based on information obtained and decisions made during the scoping process, the proponent may prepare the PDEIS. To expedite headquarters review, a summary document is also required to present the purpose and need for the action, DOPAA, major issues, unresolved issues, major potential controversies, and required mitigations or monitoring. This summary will be forwarded, through the chain of command, to ODEP, the DASA(ESOH), and other interested offices for review and comment. If requested by these offices, a draft PDEIS can be provided following review of the summary. The PDEIS is not normally made available to the public and should be stamped “For Internal Use Only-Deliberative Process.”</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">DEIS.</E> The Army proponent will advise the DEIS preparer of the number of copies to be forwarded for final HQDA review and those for filing with the EPA. Distribution may include interested congressional delegations and committees, governors, national environmental organizations, the DOD and federal agency headquarters, and other selected entities. The Army proponent will finalize the FR NOA, the proposed news release, and the EPA filing letter for signature of the DASA(ESOH). A revised process summary of the contents (purpose and need for the action, DOPAA, major issues, unresolved issues, major potential controversies, and required mitigations or monitoring) will accompany the DEIS to HQDA for review and comment. If the action has been delegated by the ASA(I&amp;E), only the process summary is required, unless the DEIS is requested by HQDA.</P>
                <P>(i) When the DEIS has been formally approved, the preparer can distribute the DEIS to the remainder of the distribution list. The DEIS must be distributed prior to, or simultaneously with, filing with EPA. The list includes federal, state, regional, and local agencies, private citizens, and local organizations. The EPA will publish the NOA in the FR. The 45-day comment period begins on the date of the EPA notice in the FR.</P>
                <P>(ii) Following approval, the proponent will forward five copies of the DEIS to EPA for filing and notice in the FR; publication of EPA's NWR commences the public comment period. The proponent will distribute the DEIS prior to, or simultaneously with, filing with EPA. Distribution will include appropriate federal, state, regional, and local agencies; Native American tribes; and organizations and private citizens who have expressed interest in the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(iii) For proposed actions that are environmentally controversial, or of national interest, the OCLL shall be notified of the pending action so that appropriate congressional coordination may be effected. The OCPA will coordinate public announcements through its chain of command. Proponents will ensure that the DEIS and subsequent NEPA documents are provided in electronic format to allow for maximum information flow throughout the process.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Public review of DEIS.</E> The DEIS public comment period will be no less than 45 days. If the statement is unusually long, a summary of the DEIS may be circulated, with an attached list of locations where the entire DEIS may be reviewed (for example, local public libraries). Distribution of the complete DEIS should be accompanied by the announcement of availability in established newspapers of major circulation, and must include the following:</P>

                <P>(1) Any federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved and any appropriate federal, state, or local agency authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards.<PRTPAGE P="320"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The applicant, if the proposed action involves any application of proposal for the use of Army resources.</P>
                <P>(3) Any person, organization, or agency requesting the entire DEIS.</P>
                <P>(4) Any Indian tribes, Native Alaskan organizations, or Native Hawaiian organizations potentially impacted by the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(5) Chairs/co-chairs of any existing citizen advisory groups (for example, Restoration Advisory Boards).</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Public meetings or hearings.</E> Public meetings or hearings on the DEIS will be held in accordance with the criteria established in 40 CFR 1506.6(c) and (d) or for any other reason the proponent deems appropriate. News releases should be prepared and issued to publicize the meetings or hearings at least 15 days prior to the meeting.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Response to comments.</E> Comments will be incorporated in the DEIS by modification of the text and/or written explanation. Where possible, similar comments will be grouped for a common response. The preparer or a higher authority may make individual response, if considered desirable.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">The FEIS.</E> If the changes to the DEIS are exclusively clarifications or minor factual corrections, a document consisting of only the DEIS comments, responses to the comments, and errata sheets may be prepared and circulated. If such an abbreviated FEIS is anticipated, the DEIS should contain a statement advising reviewers to keep the document so they will have a complete set of “final” documents. The final EIS to be filed with EPA will consist of a complete document containing a new cover sheet, the errata sheets, comments and responses, and the text of the draft EIS. Coordination, approval, filing, and public notice of an abbreviated FEIS are the same as for a draft DEIS. If extensive modifications are warranted, the proponent will prepare a new, complete FEIS. Preparation, coordination, approval, filing, and public notice of the FEIS are the same as the process outlined for the DEIS. The FEIS distribution must include any person, organization, or agency that submitted substantive comments on the DEIS. One copy (electronic) of the FEIS will be forwarded to ODEP. The FEIS will clearly identify the Army's preferred alternative unless prohibited by law.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Decision.</E> No decision will be made on a proposed action until 30 days after EPA has published the NWR of the FEIS in the FR, or 90 days after the NWR of the DEIS, whichever is later. EPA publishes NWRs weekly. Those NWRs ready for EPA by close of business Friday are published in the next Friday's issue of the FR.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">ROD.</E> The ROD documents the decision made and the basis for that decision.</P>
                <P>(1) The proponent will prepare a ROD for the decision maker's signature, which will:</P>
                <P>(i) Clearly state the decision by describing it in sufficient detail to address the significant issues and ensure necessary long-term monitoring and execution.</P>
                <P>(ii) Identify all alternatives considered by the Army in reaching its decision, specifying the environmentally preferred alternative(s). The Army will discuss preferences among alternatives based on relevant factors including environmental, economic, and technical considerations and agency statutory missions.</P>
                <P>(iii) Identify and discuss all such factors, including any essential considerations of national policy that were balanced by the Army in making its decision. Because economic and technical analyses are balanced with environmental analysis, the agency preferred alternative will not necessarily be the environmentally preferred alternative.</P>
                <P>(iv) Discuss how those considerations entered into the final decision.</P>
                <P>(v) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the selected alternative have been adopted, and if not, why they were not.</P>
                <P>(vi) Identify or incorporate by reference the mitigation measures that were incorporated into the decision.</P>
                <P>(2) Implementation of the decision may begin immediately after approval of the ROD.</P>

                <P>(3) The proponent will prepare an NOA to be published in the FR by the HQDA proponent, following congressional notification. Processing and approval of the NOA is the same as for an NOI.<PRTPAGE P="321"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) RODs will be distributed to agencies with authority or oversight over aspects of the proposal, cooperating agencies, appropriate congressional, state, and district offices, all parties that are directly affected, and others upon request.</P>
                <P>(5) One electronic copy of the ROD will be forwarded to ODEP.</P>
                <P>(6) A monitoring and enforcement program will be adopted and summarized for any mitigation (see Appendix C of this part).</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Pre-decision referrals.</E> 40 CFR part 1504 specifies procedures to resolve federal agency disagreements on the environmental effects of a proposed action. Pre-decision referrals apply to interagency disagreement on a proposed action's potential unsatisfactory effects.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Changes during preparation.</E> If there are substantial changes in the proposed action, or significant new information relevant to environmental concerns during the proposed action's planning process, the proponent will prepare revisions or a supplement to any environmental document or prepare new documentation as necessary.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Mitigation.</E> All measures planned to minimize or mitigate expected significant environmental impacts will be identified in the EIS and the ROD. Implementation of the mitigation plan is the responsibility of the proponent (see Appendix C of this part). The proponent will make available to the public, upon request, the status and results of mitigation measures associated with the proposed action. For weapon system acquisition programs, the proponent will coordinate with the appropriate responsible parties before identifying potential mitigations in the EIS/ROD.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Implementing the decision.</E> The proponent will provide for monitoring to assure that decisions are carried out, particularly in controversial cases or environmentally sensitive areas (Appendix C of this part). Mitigation and other conditions that have been identified in the EIS, or during its review and comment period, and made part of the decision (and ROD), will be implemented by the lead agency or other appropriate consenting agency. The proponent will:</P>
                <P>(1) Include appropriate conditions in grants, permits, or other approvals.</P>
                <P>(2) Ensure that the proponent's project budget includes provisions for mitigations.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon request, inform cooperating or commenting agencies on the progress in carrying out adopted mitigation measures that they have proposed and that were adopted by the agency making the decision.</P>
                <P>(4) Upon request, make the results of relevant monitoring available to the public and Congress.</P>
                <P>(5) Make results of relevant monitoring available to citizens advisory groups, and others that expressed such interest during the EIS process.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Public involvement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) As a matter of Army policy, public involvement is required for all EISs, and is strongly encouraged for all Army actions, including EAs. The requirement (40 CFR 1506.6) for public involvement recognizes that all potentially interested or affected parties will be involved, when practicable, whenever analyzing environmental considerations. This requirement can be met at the very beginning of the process by developing a plan to include all affected parties and implementing the plan with appropriate adjustments as it proceeds (AR 360-5). The plan will include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Information dissemination to local and installation communities through such means as news releases to local media, announcements to local citizens groups, and Commander's letters at each phase or milestone (more frequently if needed) of the project. The dissemination of this information will be based on the needs and desires of the local communities.</P>
                <P>(2) Each phase or milestone (more frequently if needed) of the project will be coordinated with representatives of local, state, tribal, and federal government agencies.</P>

                <P>(3) Public comments will be invited and two-way communication channels <PRTPAGE P="327"/>will be kept open through various means as stated above. These two-way channels will be dynamic in nature, and should be updated regularly to reflect the needs of the local community.</P>
                <P>(4) Public affairs officers at all levels will be kept informed.</P>
                <P>(b) When an EIS is being prepared, public involvement is a requisite element of the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(1)).</P>
                <P>(c) Proponents will invite public involvement in the review and comment of EAs and draft FNSIs (40 CFR 1506.6).</P>
                <P>(d) Persons and agencies to be consulted include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Municipal, township, and county elected and appointed officials.</P>
                <P>(2) Tribal, state, county, and local government officials and administrative personnel whose official duties include responsibility for activities or components of the affected environment related to the proposed Army action.</P>
                <P>(3) Local and regional administrators of other federal agencies or commissions that may either control resources potentially affected by the proposed action (for example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service); or who may be aware of other actions by different federal agencies whose effects must be considered with the proposed Army action (for example, the GSA).</P>
                <P>(4) Members of existing citizen advisory groups, such as Restoration Advisory Boards and Citizen Advisory Commissions.</P>
                <P>(5) Members of identifiable population segments within the potentially affected environments, whether or not they have clearly identifiable leaders or an established organization, such as farmers and ranchers, homeowners, small business owners, minority communities and disadvantaged communities, and tribal governments in accordance with White House Memorandum on Government to Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments (April 29, 1994).</P>
                <P>(6) Members and officials of those identifiable interest groups of local or national scope that may have interest in the environmental effects of the proposed action or activity (for example, hunters and fishermen, Izaak Walton League, Sierra Club, and the Audubon Society).</P>
                <P>(7) Any person or group that has specifically requested involvement in the specific action or similar actions.</P>
                <P>(e) The public involvement processes and procedures through which participation may be solicited include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Direct individual contact. Such interaction can identify persons and their opinions and initial positions, affecting the scope of issues that the EIS must address. Such limited contact may satisfy public involvement requirements when the expected significance and controversy of environmental effects is very limited.</P>
                <P>(2) Small workshops or discussion groups.</P>
                <P>(3) Larger public gatherings that are held after some formulation of the potential issues. The public is invited to express its views on the proposed courses of action. Public suggestions or alternative courses of action not already identified may be expressed at these gatherings that need not be formal public hearings.</P>
                <P>(4) Identifying and applying other processes and procedures to accomplish the appropriate level of public involvement.</P>
                <P>(f) The meetings described in paragraph (e) of this section should not be public hearings in the early stages of evaluating a proposed action. Public hearings do not substitute for the full range of public involvement procedures under the purposes and intent, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(g) Public surveys or polls may be performed to identify public opinion of a proposed action, as appropriate (AR 335-15).</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 651.48</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Scoping process.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7) is intended to aid in determining the scope of the analyses and significant issues related to the proposed action. The process requires appropriate public participation immediately following publication of the NOI in the FR. It is important to note that scoping is not synonymous with a public meeting. The Army policy is that EISs for legislative proposals significantly affecting the environment will <PRTPAGE P="328"/>go through scoping unless extenuating circumstances make it impractical. In some cases, the scoping process may be useful in the preparation of EAs and should be employed when it is useful.</P>
                <P>(b) The scoping process identifies relevant issues related to a proposed action through the involvement of all potentially interested or affected parties (affected federal, state, and local agencies; recognized Indian tribes; interest groups, and other interested persons) in the environmental analysis and documentation. This process should:</P>
                <P>(1) Eliminate issues from detailed consideration which are not significant, or which have been covered by prior environmental review; and</P>
                <P>(2) Make the analysis and documentation more efficient by providing focus to the effort. Proper scoping identifies reasonable alternatives and the information needed for their evaluation, thereby increasing public confidence in the Army decisionmaking process.</P>
                <P>(c) Proper scoping will reduce both costs and time required for an EA or EIS. This is done through the documentation of all potential impacts and the focus of detailed consideration on those aspects of the action which are potentially significant or controversial. To assist in this process the Army will use the Environmental Impact Computer System (EICS) starting in Fiscal Year (FY) 04, as appropriate. This system will serve to structure all three stages of the scoping process (§ 651.49, 651.50, and 651.51) and provide focus on those actions that are important and of interest to the public. While these discussions focus on EIS preparation and documents to support that process, the three phases also apply if scoping is used for an EA. If used in the preparation of an EA, scoping, and documents to support that process, can be modified and adopted to ensure efficient public iteration and input to the decision-making process.</P>
                <P>(d) When the planning for a project or action indicates the need for an EIS, the proponent initiates the scoping process to identify the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts for consideration in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25). The extent of the scoping process (including public involvement) will depend upon:</P>
                <P>(1) The size and type of the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether the proposed action is of regional or national interest.</P>
                <P>(3) Degree of any associated environmental controversy.</P>
                <P>(4) Importance of the affected environmental parameters.</P>
                <P>(5) Significance of any effects on them.</P>
                <P>(6) Extent of prior environmental review.</P>
                <P>(7) Involvement of any substantive time limits.</P>
                <P>(8) Requirements by other laws for environmental review.</P>
                <P>(e) The proponent may incorporate scoping in the public involvement (or environmental review) process of other requirements, such as an EA. In such cases, the extent of incorporation is at the discretion of the proponent, working with the affected Army organization or installation. Such integration is encouraged.</P>
                <P>(f) Scoping procedures fall into preliminary, public interaction, and final phases. These phases are discussed in §§ 651.49, 651.50, and 651.51, respectively.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 651.49</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Preliminary phase.</SUBJECT>
                <P>In the preliminary phase, the proponent agency or office identifies, as early as possible, how it will accomplish scoping and with whose involvement. Key points will be identified or briefly summarized by the proponent, as appropriate, in the NOI, which will:</P>
                <P>(a) Identify the significant issues to be analyzed in the EIS.</P>
                <P>(b) Identify the office or person responsible for matters related to the scoping process. If they are not the same as the proponent of the action, that distinction will be made.</P>
                <P>(c) Identify the lead and cooperating agency, if already determined (40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6).</P>

                <P>(d) Identify the method by which the agency will invite participation of affected parties, and identify a tentative list of the affected parties to be notified. A key part of this preliminary identification is to solicit input regarding other parties who would be interested in the proposed project or affected by it.<PRTPAGE P="329"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) Identify the proposed method for accomplishing the scoping procedure.</P>
                <P>(f) Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation of environmental analyses and the tentative planning and decisionmaking schedule including:</P>
                <P>(1) The scoping process itself.</P>
                <P>(2) Collection or analysis of environmental data, including required studies.</P>
                <P>(3) Preparation of draft and final EISs (DEISs and FEISs), and associated review periods.</P>
                <P>(4) Filing of the ROD.</P>
                <P>(5) Taking the action.</P>
                <P>(6) For a programmatic EIS, preparation of a general expected schedule for future specific implementing (tiered) actions that will involve separate environmental analysis.</P>
                <P>(g) If applicable, identify the extent to which the EIS preparation process is exempt from any of the normal procedural requirements of this part, including scoping.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Public interaction phase.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) During this portion of the process, the proponent will invite comments from all affected parties and respondents to the NOI to assist in developing issues for detailed discussion in the EIS. Assistance in identifying possible participants is available from the ODEP.</P>
                <P>(b) In addition to the affected parties identified in paragraph (a) of this section, participants should include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Technical representatives of the proponent. Such persons must be able to describe the technical aspects of the proposed action and alternatives to other participants.</P>
                <P>(2) One or more representatives of any Army-contracted consulting firm, if one has been retained to participate in writing the EIS or providing reports that the Army will use to create substantial portions of the EIS.</P>
                <P>(3) Experts in various environmental disciplines, in any technical area where foreseen impacts are not already represented among the other scoping participants.</P>
                <P>(c) In all cases, the participants will be provided with information developed during the preliminary phase and with as much of the following information that may be available:</P>
                <P>(1) A brief description of the environment at the affected location. When descriptions for a specific location are not available, general descriptions of the probable environmental effects will be provided. This will also address the extent to which the environment has been modified or affected in the past.</P>
                <P>(2) A description of the proposed alternatives. The description will be sufficiently detailed to enable evaluation of the range of impacts that may be caused by the proposed action and alternatives. The amount of detail that is sufficient will depend on the stage of the development of the proposal, its magnitude, and its similarity to other actions with which participants may be familiar.</P>
                <P>(3) A tentative identification of “any public environmental assessments and other environmental impact statements that are being or will be prepared that are related to but are not part of the scope of the impact statement under consideration” (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)).</P>
                <P>(4) Any additional scoping issues or limitations on the EIS, if not already described during the preliminary phase.</P>
                <P>(d) The public involvement should begin with the NOI to publish an EIS. The NOI may indicate when and where a scoping meeting will take place and who to contact to receive preliminary information. The scoping meeting is an informal public meeting, and initiates a continuous scoping process, allowing the Army to scope the action and the impacts of alternatives. It is a working session where the gathering and evaluation of information relating to potential environmental impacts can be initiated.</P>

                <P>(e) Starting with this information (paragraph (d) of this section), the person conducting the scoping process will use input from any of the involved or affected parties. This will aid in developing the conclusions. The proponent determines the final scope of the EIS. If the proponent chooses not to require detailed treatment of significant issues or factors in the EIS, in spite of relevant technical or scientific objections by any participant, the proponent will <PRTPAGE P="330"/>clearly identify (in the environmental consequences section of the EIS) the criteria that were used to eliminate such factors.</P>

                <SUBJECT>The final phase.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The initial scope of the DEIS is determined by the proponent during and after the public interaction phase of the process. Detailed analysis should focus on significant issues (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(2)). To determine the appropriate scope, the proponent must consider three categories of actions, alternatives, and impacts.</P>
                <P>(1) The three categories of actions (other than unconnected single actions) are as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Connected actions are those that are closely related and should be discussed in the same impact statement. Actions are connected if they automatically trigger other actions that may require EISs, cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are previously or simultaneously taken, are interdependent parts of a larger action, and depend on the larger action for their justification.</P>
                <P>(ii) Cumulative actions are those that, when viewed with other past and proposed actions, have cumulatively significant impacts and should be discussed in the same impact statement.</P>
                <P>(iii) Similar actions are those that have similarities which provide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences together, such as common timing or geography, and may be analyzed in the EIS. Agencies should do so when the best way to assess such actions is to treat them in a single EIS.</P>
                <P>(2) The three categories of alternatives are as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) No action.</P>
                <P>(ii) Other reasonable courses of action.</P>
                <P>(iii) Mitigation measures (not in the proposed action).</P>
                <P>(3) The three categories of impacts are as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Direct.</P>
                <P>(ii) Indirect.</P>
                <P>(iii) Cumulative.</P>
                <P>(4) The proponent can also identify any public EAs and EISs, prepared by the Army or another federal agency, related to, but not part of, the EIS under consideration (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)). Assignments for the preparation of the EIS among the lead and any cooperating agencies can be identified, with the lead agency retaining responsibility for the statement (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(4)); along with the identification of any other environmental review and consultation requirements so the lead and cooperating agencies may prepare other required analyses and studies concurrently with the EIS (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(6)).</P>
                <P>(b) The identification and elimination of issues that are insignificant, non-controversial, or covered by prior environmental review can narrow the analysis to remaining issues and their significance through reference to their coverage elsewhere (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(3)).</P>
                <P>(c) As part of the scoping process, the lead agency may:</P>
                <P>(1) Set time limits, as provided in § 651.14(b), if they were not already indicated in the preliminary phase.</P>
                <P>(2) Prescribe overall page limits for the EIS in accordance with the CEQ regulations that emphasize conciseness.</P>
                <P>(d) All determinations reached by the proponent during the scoping process will be clearly conveyed to the preparers of the EIS in a Scope of Statement. The Scope of Statement will be made available to participants in the scoping process and to other interested parties upon request. Any scientific or technical conflicts that arise between the proponent and scoping participants, cooperating agencies, other federal agencies, or preparers will be identified during the scoping process and resolved or discussed by the proponent in the DEIS.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 651.52</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Aids to information gathering.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The proponent may use or develop graphic or other innovative methods to aid information gathering, presentation, and transfer during the three scoping phases. These include methods for presenting preliminary information to scoping participants, obtaining and consolidating input from participants, and organizing determinations on scope for use during preparation of the DEIS. The use of the World Wide Web <PRTPAGE P="331"/>(WWW) for these purposes is encouraged. Suggested uses include the implementation of a continuous scoping process, facilitating “virtual” public participation, as well as the dissemination of analyses and information as they evolve.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Modifications of the scoping process.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If a lengthy period exists between a decision to prepare an EIS and the time of preparation, the proponent will initiate the NOI at a reasonable time in advance of preparation of the DEIS. The NOI will state any tentative conclusions regarding the scope of the EIS made prior to publication of the NOI. Reasonable time for public participation will be allowed before the proponent makes any final decisions or commitments on the EIS.</P>
                <P>(b) The proponent of a proposed action may use scoping during preparation of environmental review documents other than an EIS, if desired. In such cases, the proponent may use these procedures or may develop modified procedures, as needed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Protection of the environment is an Army priority, no matter where the Army actions are undertaken. The Army is committed to pursuing an active role in addressing environmental quality issues in Army relations with neighboring communities and assuring that consideration of the environment is an integral part of all decisions. This section assigns responsibilities for review of environmental effects abroad of major Army actions, as required by Executive Order 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, dated January 4, 1979, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp.,p.356. This section applies to HQDA and Army agencies' actions that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment outside the United States.</P>
                <P>(b) Executive Order 12114 and DODD 6050.7, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions (planned currently to be replaced by a DODI, Analyzing Defense Actions With the Potential for Significant Impacts Outside the United States) provide guidance for analyzing the environmental impacts of Army actions abroad and in the global commons. Army components will, consistent with diplomatic factors (including applicable Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) and stationing agreements), national security considerations, and difficulties of obtaining information, document the review of potential environmental impacts of Army actions abroad and in the global commons as set forth in DODD 6050.7 (or DODI upon publication). The analysis and documentation of potential environmental impacts of Army actions abroad and in the global commons should, to the maximum extent possible, be incorporated into existing decision-making processes; planning for military exercises, training plans, and military operations.</P>

              <APPENDIX>
                <EAR>Pt. 651, App. C</EAR>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 651—Mitigation and Monitoring</HD>
                <P>(a) The CEQ regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) recognize the following five means of mitigating an environmental impact. These five approaches to mitigation are presented in order of desirability.</P>
                <P>(1) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action. This method avoids environmental impact by eliminating certain activities in certain areas. As an example, the Army's Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) program accounts for training requirements and activities while considering natural and cultural resource conditions on ranges and training land. This program allows informed management decisions associated with the use of these lands, and has mitigated potential impacts by limiting activities to areas that are compatible with Army training needs. Sensitive habitats and other resources are thus protected, while the mission requirements are still met.</P>

                <P>(2) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation. Limiting the degree or magnitude of the action can reduce the extent of <PRTPAGE P="337"/>an impact. For example, changing the firing time or the number of rounds fired on artillery ranges will reduce the noise impact on nearby residents. Using the previous ITAM example, the conditions of ranges can be monitored, and, when the conditions on the land warrant, the intensity or magnitude of the training on that parcel can be modified through a variety of decisions.</P>
                <P>(3) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the effect on the environment. This method restores the environment to its previous condition or better. Movement of troops and vehicles across vegetated areas often destroys vegetation. Either reseeding or replanting the areas with native plants after the exercise can mitigate this impact.</P>
                <P>(4) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action. This method designs the action so as to reduce adverse environmental effects. Examples include maintaining erosion control structures, using air pollution control devices, and encouraging car pools in order to reduce transportation effects such as air pollution, energy consumption, and traffic congestion.</P>
                <P>(5) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments (40 CFR 1508.20). This method replaces the resource or environment that will be impacted by the action. Replacement can occur in-kind or otherwise; for example, deer habitat in the project area can be replaced with deer habitat in another area; an in-kind replacement at a different location. This replacement can occur either on the impact site or at another location. This type of mitigation is often used in water resources projects.</P>
                <P>(b) The identification and evaluation of mitigations involves the use of experts familiar with the predicted environmental impacts. Many potential sources of information are available for assistance. These include sources within the Army such as the USACHPPM, the USAEC, the MACOM environmental office, the ODEP, COE research laboratories, COE districts and divisions, and DoD Regional Support Centers. State agencies are another potential source of information, and the appropriate POC within these agencies may be obtained from the installation environmental office. Local interest groups may also be able to help identify potential mitigation measures. Other suggested sources of assistance include:</P>

                <P>(c) Several different mitigation techniques have been used on military installations for a number of years. The following examples illustrate the variety of possible measures:</P>
                <P>(1) There are maneuver restrictions in areas used extensively for tracked vehicle training. These restrictions are not designed to infringe on the military mission, but rather to reduce the amount of damage to the training area.</P>
                <P>(2) Aerial seeding has been done on some installations to reduce erosion problems.</P>

                <P>(3) Changing the time and/or frequency of operations has been used. This may involve changing the season of the year, the time of <PRTPAGE P="338"/>day, or even day of the week for various activities. These changes avoid noise impacts as well as aesthetic, transportation, and some ecological problems.</P>
                <P>(4) Reducing the effects of construction has involved using techniques that keep heavy equipment away from protected trees and quickly re-seeding areas after construction.</P>
                <P>(d) Monitoring and enforcement programs are applicable (40 CFR 1505.2(c)) and the specific adopted action is an important case (40 CFR 1505.3) if:</P>
                <P>(1) There is a change in environmental conditions or project activities that were assumed in the EIS, such that original predictions of the extent of adverse environmental impacts may be too limited.</P>
                <P>(2) The outcome of the mitigation measure is uncertain, such as in the case of the application of new technology.</P>
                <P>(3) Major environmental controversy remains associated with the selected alternative.</P>
                <P>(4) Failure of a mitigation measure, or other unforeseen circumstances, could result in serious harm to federal-or state-listed endangered or threatened species; important historic or archaeological sites that are either on, or meet eligibility requirements for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places; wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, or other public or private protected resources. Evaluation and determination of what constitutes serious harm must be made in coordination with the appropriate federal, state, or local agency responsible for each particular program.</P>
                <P>(e) Five basic considerations affect the establishment of monitoring programs:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Legal requirements.</E> Permits for some actions will require that a monitoring system be established (for example, dredge and fill permits from the USACE). These permits will generally require both enforcement and effectiveness monitoring programs.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Protected resources.</E> These include federal-or state-listed endangered or threatened species, important historic or archaeological sites (whether or not these are listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places), wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and other public or private protected resources. Private protected resources include areas such as Audubon Society Refuges, Nature Conservancy lands, or any other land that would be protected by law if it were under government ownership, but is privately owned. If any of these resources are affected, an effectiveness and enforcement-monitoring program must be undertaken in conjunction with the federal, state, or local agency that manages the type of resource.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Major environmental controversy.</E> If a controversy remains regarding the effect of an action or the effectiveness of a mitigation, an enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program must be undertaken. Controversy includes not only scientific disagreement about the mitigation's effectiveness, but also public interest or debate.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Mitigation outcome.</E> The probability of the mitigation's success must be carefully considered. The proponent must know if the mitigation has been successful elsewhere. The validity of the outcome should be confirmed by expert opinion. However, the proponent should note that a certain technique, such as artificial seeding with the natural vegetation, which may have worked successfully in one area, may not work in another.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Changed conditions.</E> The final consideration is whether any condition, such as the environmental setting, has changed (for example, a change in local land use around the area, or a change in project activities, such as increased amount of acreage being used or an increased movement of troops). Such changes will require preparation of a supplemental document (see §§ 651.5(g) and 651.24) and additional monitoring. If none of these conditions are met (that is, requirement by law, protected resources, no major controversy is involved, effectiveness of the mitigation is known, and the environmental or project conditions have not changed), then only an enforcement monitoring program is needed. Otherwise, both an enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program will be required.</P>
                <P>(f) Enforcement monitoring program. The development of an enforcement monitoring program is governed by who will actually perform the mitigation; a contractor, a cooperating agency, or an in-house (Army) lead agency. The lead agency is ultimately responsible for performing any mitigation activities.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Contract performance.</E> Several provisions must be made in work to be performed by contract. The lead agency must ensure that contract provisions include the performance of the mitigation activity and that penalty clauses are written into the contracts. It must provide for timely inspection of the mitigation measures and is responsible for enforcing all contract provision.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Cooperating agency performance.</E> The lead agency must ensure that, if a cooperating agency performs the work, it understands its role in the mitigation. The lead agency must determine and agree upon how the mitigation measures will be funded. It must also ensure that any necessary formal paperwork such as cooperating agreements is complete.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Lead agency performance.</E> If the lead agency performs the mitigation, the proponent must ensure that needed tasks are performed, provide appropriate funding in the project budget, arrange for necessary manpower allocations, and make any necessary changes in the agency (installation) regulations (such as environmental or range regulations).<PRTPAGE P="339"/>
                </P>
                <P>(g) Effectiveness monitoring. Effectiveness monitoring is often difficult to establish. The first step is to determine what must be monitored, based on criteria discussed during the establishment of the system; for example, the legal requirements, protected resources, area of controversy, known effectiveness, or changed conditions. Initially, this can be a very broad statement, such as reduction of impacts on a particular stream by a combination of replanting, erosion control devices, and range regulations. The next step is finding the expertise necessary to establish the monitoring system. The expertise may be available on-post or may be obtained from an outside source. After a source of expertise is located, the program can be established using the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) Any technical parameters used must be measurable; for example, the monitoring program must be quantitative and statistically sound.</P>
                <P>(2) A baseline study must be completed before the monitoring begins in order to identify the actual state of the system prior to any disturbance.</P>
                <P>(3) The monitoring system must have a control, so that it can isolate the effects of the mitigation procedures from effects originating outside the action.</P>
                <P>(4) The system's parameters and means of measuring them must be replicable.</P>
                <P>(5) Parameter results must be available in a timely manner so that the decision maker can take any necessary corrective action before the effects are irreversible.</P>
                <P>(6) Not every mitigation has to be monitored separately. The effectiveness of several mitigation actions can be determined by one measurable parameter. For example, the turbidity measurement from a stream can include the combined effectiveness of mitigation actions such as reseeding, maneuver restrictions, and erosion control devices. However, if a method combines several parameters and a critical change is noted, each mitigation measurement must be examined to determine the problem.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Part 651—Public Participation Plan</HD>
                <P>The objective of the plan will be to encourage the full and open discussion of issues related to Army actions. Some NEPA actions will be very limited in scope, and may not require full public participation and involvement. Other NEPA actions will obviously be of interest, not only to the local community, but to others across the country as well.</P>
                <P>(a) To accomplish this objective, the plan will require:</P>
                <P>(1) Dissemination of information to local and installation communities through such means as news releases to local media, announcements to local citizens groups, and Commander's letters. Such information may be subject to Freedom of Information Act and operations security review.</P>
                <P>(2) The invitation of public comments through two-way communication channels that will be kept open through various means.</P>
                <P>(3) The use of fully informed public affairs officers at all levels.</P>
                <P>(4) Preparation of EAs which incorporate public involvement processes whenever appropriate (40 CFR 1506.6).</P>
                <P>(5) Consultation of persons and agencies such as:</P>
                <P>(i) Municipal, township, and county elected and appointed officials.</P>
                <P>(ii) Tribal, state, county, and local government officials and administrative personnel whose official duties include responsibility for activities or components of the affected environment related to the proposed Army action.</P>
                <P>(iii) Local and regional administrators of other federal agencies or commissions that may either control resources potentially affected by the proposed action (for example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) or who may be aware of other actions by different federal agencies whose effects must be considered with the proposed Army action (for example, the GSA).</P>
                <P>(iv) Members of identifiable population segments within the potentially affected environments, whether or not they have clearly identifiable leaders or an established organization such as farmers and ranchers, homeowners, small business owners, and Native Americans.</P>
                <P>(v) Members and officials of those identifiable interest groups of local or national scope that may have an interest in the environmental effects of the proposed action or activity (for example, hunters and fishermen, Isaak Walton League, Sierra Club, and the Audubon Society).</P>
                <P>(vi) Any person or group that has specifically requested involvement in the specific action or similar actions.</P>
                <P>(b) Public involvement should be solicited using the following processes and procedures:</P>
                <P>(1) Direct individual contact. Such limited contact may suffice for all required public involvement, when the expected environmental effect is of a very limited scope. This contact should identify:</P>
                <P>(i) Persons expected to express an opinion and later participate.</P>
                <P>(ii) Preliminary positions of such persons on the scope of issues that the analysis must address.</P>
                <P>(2) Small workshops or discussion groups.</P>

                <P>(3) Larger public gatherings that are held after some formulation of the potential issues, inviting the public to express views on the proposed courses of action. Public suggestions or additional alternative courses <PRTPAGE P="340"/>of action may be expressed at these gatherings which need not be formal public hearings.</P>
                <P>(4) Any other processes and procedures to accomplish the appropriate level of public involvement.</P>
                <P>(c) Scoping Guidance. All affected parties must be included in the scoping process (AR 360-5). The plan must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Information disseminated to local and installation communities through such means as news releases to local media, announcements to local citizens groups, and Commander's letters at each phase or milestone (more frequently if needed) of the project. Such information may be subject to Freedom of Information Act and operations security review.</P>
                <P>(2) Each phase or milestone (more frequently if needed) of the project will be coordinated with representatives of local, state, and federal government agencies.</P>
                <P>(3) Public comments will be invited and two-way communication channels will be kept open through various means as stated above.</P>
                <P>(4) Public affairs officers at all levels will be kept informed.</P>
                <P>(5) When an EIS is being prepared, public involvement is a requisite element of the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(1)).</P>
                <P>(6) Preparation of EAs will incorporate public involvement processes whenever appropriate (40 CFR 1506.6).</P>

                <P>(v) Members and officials of those identifiable interest groups of local or national scope that may have interest in the environmental effects of the proposed action or activity (for example, hunters and fishermen, Isaak Walton League, Sierra Club, and the Audubon Society).</P>
                <P>(vi) Any person or group that has specifically requested involvement in the specific action or similar actions.</P>
                <P>(8) The public involvement processes and procedures by which participation may be solicited include the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The direct individual contact process identifies persons expected to express an opinion and participate in later public meetings. Direct contact may also identify the preliminary positions of such persons on the scope of issues that the EIS will address. Such limited contact may suffice for all required public involvement, when the expected environmental effect is of very limited scope.</P>
                <P>(ii) Small workshops or discussion groups.</P>
                <P>(iii) Larger public gatherings that are held after some formulation of the potential issues. The public is invited to express its views on the proposed courses of action. Public suggestions or alternative courses of action not already identified may be expressed at these gatherings that need not be formal public hearings.</P>
                <P>(iv) Identifying and applying other processes and procedures to accomplish the appropriate level of public involvement.</P>
                <P>(9) The meetings described above should not be public hearings in the early stages of evaluating a proposed action. Public hearings do not substitute for the full range of public involvement procedures under the purposes and intent of (a) of this appendix.</P>
                <P>(10) Public surveys or polls to identify public opinion of a proposed action will be performed (AR 335-15, chapter 10).</P>

                <P>(1) In the NOI, identify the significant issues to be analyzed in the EIS.</P>
                <P>(2) In the NOI, identify the office or person responsible for matters related to the scoping process. If they are not the same as the proponent of the action, make that distinction.</P>
                <P>(3) Identify the lead and cooperating agency, if already determined (40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6).</P>
                <P>(4) Identify the method by which the agency will invite participation of affected parties; and identify a tentative list of the affected parties to be notified.</P>
                <P>(5) Identify the proposed method for accomplishing the scoping procedure.</P>
                <P>(6) Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation of environmental analyses and the tentative planning and decision-making schedule including:</P>
                <P>(i) The scoping process itself.</P>
                <P>(ii) Collecting or analyzing environmental data, including studies required of cooperating agencies.</P>
                <P>(iii) Preparation of DEISs and FEISs.</P>
                <P>(iv) Filing of the ROD.</P>
                <P>(v) Taking the action.<PRTPAGE P="341"/>
                </P>
                <P>(7) For a programmatic EIS, preparing a general expected schedule for future specific implementing actions that will involve separate environmental analysis.</P>
                <P>(8) If applicable, in the NOI, identify the extent to which the EIS preparation process is exempt from any of the normal procedural requirements of this part, including scoping.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Part 651—Content of the Environmental Impact Statement</HD>
                <P>(a) EISs will:</P>
                <P>(1) Be analytic rather than encyclopedic. Impacts will be discussed in proportion to their significance; and insignificant impacts will only be briefly discussed, sufficient to show why more analysis is not warranted.</P>
                <P>(2) Be kept concise and no longer than absolutely necessary to comply with NEPA, CEQ regulations, and this part. Length should be determined by potential environmental issues, not project size. The EIS should be no longer than 300 pages.</P>
                <P>(3) Describe the criteria for selecting alternatives, and discuss those alternatives, including the “no action” alternative, to be considered by the ultimate decision maker.</P>
                <P>(4) Serve as a means to assess environmental impacts of proposed military actions, rather than justifying decisions.</P>
                <P>(b) The EIS will consist of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Cover sheet.</E> The cover sheet will not exceed one page (40 CFR 1502.11) and will be accompanied by a signature page for the proponent, designated as preparer; the installation environmental office (or other source of NEPA expertise), designated as reviewer; and the Installation Commander (or other Activity Commander), designated as approver. It will include:</P>
                <P>(i) The following statement: “The material contained in the attached (final or draft) EIS is for internal coordination use only and may not be released to non-Department of Defense agencies or individuals until coordination has been completed and the material has been cleared for public release by appropriate authority.” This sheet will be removed prior to filing the document with the EPA.</P>
                <P>(ii) A list of responsible agencies including the lead agency and any cooperating agency.</P>
                <P>(iii) The title of the proposed action that is the subject of the statement and, if appropriate, the titles of related cooperating agency actions, together with state and county (or other jurisdiction as applicable) where the action is located.</P>
                <P>(iv) The name, address, and telephone number of the person at the agency who can supply further information, and, as appropriate, the name and title of the major approval authority in the command channel through HQDA staff proponent.</P>
                <P>(v) A designation of the statement as a draft, final, or draft or final supplement.</P>
                <P>(vi) A one-paragraph abstract of the statement that describes only the need for the proposed action, alternative actions, and the significant environmental consequences of the proposed action and alternatives.</P>
                <P>(vii) The date by which comments must be received, computed in cooperation with the EPA.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Summary.</E> The summary will stress the major conclusions of environmental analysis, areas of controversy, and issues yet to be resolved. The summary presentation will focus on the scope of the EIS, including issues that will not be evaluated in detail. It should list all federal permits, licenses, and other entitlements that must be obtained prior to proposal implementation. Further, a statement of compliance with the requirements of other federal environmental protection laws will be included (40 CFR 1502.25). To simplify consideration of complex relationships, every effort will be made to present the summary of alternatives and their impacts in a graphic format with the narrative. The EIS summary should be written at the standard middle school reading level. This summary should not exceed 15 pages. An additional summary document will be prepared for separate submission to the DEP and the ASA(I&amp;E). This will identify progress “to the date,” in addition to the standard EIS summary which:</P>
                <P>(i) Summarizes the content of the document (from an oversight perspective).</P>
                <P>(ii) Outlines mitigation requirements (to improve mitigation tracking and the programming of funds).</P>
                <P>(iii) Identifies major and unresolved issues and potential controversies. For EIS actions that have been delegated by the ASA(I&amp;E), this document will also include status of requirements and conditions established by the delegation letter.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Table of contents.</E> This section will provide for the table of contents, list of figures and tables, and a list of all referenced documents, including a bibliography of references within the body of the EIS. The table of contents should have enough detail so that searching for sections of text is not difficult.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Purpose of and need for the action.</E> This section should clearly state the nature of the problem and discuss how the proposed action or range of alternatives would solve the problem. This section will briefly give the relevant background information on the proposed action and summarize its operational, social, economic, and environmental objectives. This section is designed specifically to call attention to the benefits of the proposed action. If a cost-benefit analysis has been prepared for the proposed action, it may be included here, or attached as an appendix and referenced here.<PRTPAGE P="342"/>
                </P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Alternatives considered, including proposed action and no action alternative.</E> This section presents all reasonable alternatives and their likely environmental impacts, written in simple, nontechnical language for the lay reader. A no action alternative must be included (40 CFR 1502.14(d)). A preferred alternative need not be identified in the DEIS; although a preferred alternative generally must be included in the FEIS (40 CFR 1502.14(e)). The environmental impacts of the alternatives should be presented in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among the options that are provided the decision maker and the public (40 CFR 1502.14). The information should be summarized in a brief, concise manner. The use of graphics and tabular or matrix format is encouraged to provide the reviewer with an at-a-glance review. In summary, the following points are required:</P>
                <P>(i) A description of all reasonable alternatives, including the preferred action, alternatives beyond DA jurisdiction (40 CFR 1502.14(c)), and the no action alternative.</P>
                <P>(ii) A comparative presentation of the environmental consequences of all reasonable alternative actions, including the preferred alternative.</P>
                <P>(iii) A description of the mitigation measures and/or monitoring procedures (§ 651.15) nominated for incorporation into the proposed action and alternatives, as well as mitigation measures that are available but not incorporated and/or monitoring procedures (§ 651.15).</P>
                <P>(iv) Listing of any alternatives that were eliminated from detailed study. A brief discussion of the reasons for which each alternative was eliminated.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Affected environment (baseline conditions) that may be impacted.</E> This section will contain information about existing conditions in the affected areas in sufficient detail to understand the potential effects of the alternatives under consideration (40 CFR 1502.15). Affected elements could include, for example, biophysical characteristics (ecology and water quality); land use and land use plans; architectural, historical, and cultural amenities; utilities and services; and transportation. This section will not be encyclopedic. It will be written clearly and the degree of detail for points covered will be related to the significance and magnitude of expected impacts. Elements not impacted by any of the alternatives need only be presented in summary form, or referenced.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Environmental and socioeconomic consequences.</E> This section forms the scientific and analytic basis for the comparison of impacts. It should discuss:</P>
                <P>(i) Direct effects and their significance.</P>
                <P>(ii) Indirect effects and their significance.</P>
                <P>(iii) Possible conflicts between the proposed action and existing land use plans, policies, and controls.</P>
                <P>(iv) Environmental effects of the alternatives, including the proposed action and the no action alternative.</P>
                <P>(v) Energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.</P>
                <P>(vi) Irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources associated with the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(vii) Relationship between short-term use of the environment and maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity.</P>
                <P>(viii) Urban quality, historic, and cultural resources, and design of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.</P>
                <P>(ix) Cumulative effects of the proposed action in light of other past, present, and foreseeable actions.</P>
                <P>(x) Means to mitigate or monitor adverse environmental impacts.</P>
                <P>(xi) Any probable adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">List of preparers.</E> The EIS will list the names of its preparers, together with their qualifications (expertise, experience, and professional disciplines) (40 CFR 1502.17), including those people who were primarily responsible for preparing (research, data collection, and writing) the EIS or significant background or support papers, and basic components of the statement. When possible, the people who are responsible for a particular analysis, as well as an analysis of background papers, will be identified. If some or all of the preparers are contractors' employees, they must be identified as such. Identification of the firm that prepared the EIS is not, by itself, adequate to meet the requirements of this point. Normally, this list will not exceed two pages. Contractors will execute disclosure statements specifying that they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project. These statements will be referenced in this section of the EIS.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Distribution list.</E> For the DEIS, a list will be prepared indicating from whom review and comment is requested. The list will include public agencies and private parties or organizations. The distribution of the DEIS and FEIS will include the CBTDEVs from whom comments were requested, irrespective of whether they provided comments.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Index.</E> The index will be an alphabetical list of topics in the EIS, especially of the types of effects induced by the various alternative actions. Reference may be made to either page number or paragraph number.</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Appendices (as appropriate).</E> If an agency prepares an appendix to an EIS, the appendix will consist of material prepared in <PRTPAGE P="343"/>connection with an EIS (distinct from material not so prepared and incorporated by reference), consist only of material that substantiates any analysis fundamental to an impact statement, be analytic and relevant to the decision to be made, and be circulated with the EIS or readily available.</P>

              <P>(b) Army radiation permits are required for use, storage, or possession of ionizing radiation sources by non-Army entities (including their civilian contractors) on an Army installation. Such use, storage, or possession of ionizing radiation sources must be in connection with an activity of the Department of Defense or in connection with a service to be performed on the installation for the benefit of the Department of Defense, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2692(b)(1). Approval by the garrison commander is required to obtain an Army radiation permit. For the purposes of this section, an ionizing radiation source is:</P>
              <P>(1) Radioactive material used, stored, or possessed under the authority of a specific license issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or an Agreement State (10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70 or the equivalent regulations of an Agreement State); or</P>
              <P>(2) A machine-produced ionizing radiation source capable of producing an area, accessible to individuals, in which radiation levels could result in an individual receiving a dose equivalent in excess of 0.1 rem (1 mSv) in 1 hour at 30 centimeters from the ionizing radiation source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates.</P>
              <P>(c) A permit is not required for non-Army entities (including their civilian contractors) that use Army licensed radioactive material on an Army installation in coordination with the Army NRC licensee. The non-Army entity must obtain permission from the Army NRC licensee to use the radioactive materials and be in compliance with all of the Army NRC license conditions prior to beginning work on Army land.</P>

              <P>(d) Other Military Departments are exempt from the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section to obtain an Army radiation permit; however, the garrison Radiation Safety Officer <PRTPAGE P="348"/>(RSO) must be notified prior to ionizing radiation sources being brought onto the installation.</P>
              <P>(e) Applicants will apply for an Army radiation permit by letter with supporting documentation (paragraph (f) of this section) to the garrison commander through the appropriate tenant commander or garrison director. Submit the letter so that the garrison commander receives the application at least 30 calendar days before the requested effective date of the permit.</P>
              <P>(f) The Army radiation permit application will include a proposed effective date and duration (not to exceed 12 months) for the Army radiation permit and describe the purposes for which the ionizing radiation source will be used. The application will include: Identification of the trained operating personnel who will be responsible for implementation of the activities authorized by the permit and a summary of their professional qualifications; the applicant's point-of-contact name and phone number; the applicant's radiation safety Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs); storage provisions when the ionizing radiation source is not in use; and procedures for notifying the garrison of reportable incidents/accidents.</P>
              <P>(g) The garrison commander may approve the application only if the applicant provides evidence to show that one of the following is true:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant possesses a valid NRC license or Department of Energy (DOE) radiological work permit that allows the applicant to use the ionizing radiation source in the manner requested in the Army radiation permit application;</P>
              <P>(2) The applicant possesses a valid Agreement State license that allows the applicant to use the ionizing radiation source in the manner requested in the Army radiation permit application. An applicant operating in areas subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction (Agreement States Letter SP-96-022) has to file a NRC Form-241, Report of Proposed Activities in Non-Agreement States, with the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 150.20(b);</P>
              <P>(3) For machine-produced ionizing radiation sources, the applicant has an appropriate State authorization that allows the applicant to use the ionizing radiation source as requested in the Army radiation permit application and has in place a radiation safety program that complies with applicable Army regulations; or</P>
              <P>(4) For installations outside of the United States, the applicant has an appropriate host-nation authorization as necessary that allows the applicant to use the ionizing radiation source in the manner requested in the Army radiation permit application and has in place a radiation safety program that complies with applicable Army regulations and host nation laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(h) Applicants and permit holders shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, interstate, and local laws and regulations, status-of-forces agreements (SOFAs), and other international agreements.</P>
              <P>(i) Each Army radiation permit will require the permit holder to remove its permitted ionizing radiation sources from Army property prior to the expiration of the permit and restore all real or personal property of the Army that was modified, altered, or otherwise changed as a result of the permit holder's activities to the condition such property was in prior to the effective date of the permit.</P>
              <P>(j) An Army radiation permit issued pursuant to this section shall be valid for no more than 12 months.</P>
              <P>(k) Disposal of radioactive material by non-Army entities on Army property is prohibited. However, the garrison commander may give written authorization for releases of radioactive material to the atmosphere or to the sanitary sewerage system if such releases are in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, interstate, and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the NRC regulations at 10 CFR part 20, Subpart K, or the equivalent requirements of an Agreement State, and regulations issued by the Army or the Department of Defense, to include compliance with any applicable requirement to obtain a permit, license, or other authorization, or to submit any information, notification, or report for such release.</P>
