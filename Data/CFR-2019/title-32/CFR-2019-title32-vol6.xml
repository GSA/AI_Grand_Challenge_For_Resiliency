      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <P>When asking an individual for his or her Social Security Number, always give a Privacy Act Statement that tells the person: The legal authority for requesting it; the uses that will be made of the Social Security Number; and whether providing the Social Security Number is voluntary or mandatory. Do not deny anyone a legal right, <PRTPAGE P="12"/>benefit, or privilege for refusing to give their Social Security Number unless the law requires disclosure, or a law or regulation adopted before January 1, 1975 required the Social Security Number and the Air Force uses it to verify a person's identity in a system of records established before that date.</P>
                <P>(a) The Air Force requests an individual's Social Security Number and provides the individual information required by law when anyone enters military service or becomes an Air Force civilian employee. The Air Force uses the Social Security Number as a service or employment number to reference the individual's official records. When you ask someone for a Social Security Number as identification to retrieve an existing record, you do not have to restate this information.</P>

When law does not require disclosing the Social Security Number or when the system of records was created after January 1, 1975, you may ask for the Social Security Number, but the individual does not have to disclose it. If the individual refuses to respond, use alternative means of identifying records. (c) Social Security Numbers are personal and unique to each individual. Protect them as for official use only (FOUO).</P>

                <P>Consider a request from an individual for his or her own records in a system of records under both the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act regardless of the Act cited. The requester does not need to cite either Act if the records they want are contained in a system of records. Process the request under whichever Act gives the most information. When necessary, tell the requester which Act you used and why.</P>

                <P>(a) Requesters should describe the records they want. They do not have to name a system of records number, but they should at least name a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for “all records about me,” ask for more information and tell the person how to review the Air Force systems of records published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or at <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Requesters should not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels for making Privacy Act requests. System managers will process such requests and tell requesters that using government resources to make Privacy Act requests is not authorized.</P>
                <P>(c) Tell the requester if a record exists and how to review the record. If possible, respond to requests within 10 workdays of receipt. If you cannot answer the request in 10 workdays, send a letter explaining why and give an approximate completion date no more than 20 workdays after the first office received the request.</P>

                <P>(d) Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 30 workdays of receiving the request unless the system <PRTPAGE P="13"/>is exempt and the Air Force lists the exemption in appendix D to this part; or it is published in this section; or published as a final rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Give information in a form the requester can understand. If the system is exempt under the Privacy Act, provide any parts releasable under the Freedom of Information Act, with appeal rights (<E T="03">See</E> subpart F of this part), citing appropriate exemptions from the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act, if applicable.</P>
                <P>(e) If the requester wants another person present during the record review, the system manager may ask for written consent to authorize discussing the record with another person present.</P>

                <P>Exemptions permissible under 5 U.S.C. 552a (subject to § 806b.38 of this part):</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">The (j)(2) exemption.</E> Applies to investigative records created and maintained by law-enforcement activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">The (k)(1) exemption.</E> Applies to information specifically authorized to be classified under the DoD Information Security Program Regulation, 32 CFR part 159.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">The (k)(2) exemption.</E> Applies to investigatory information compiled for <PRTPAGE P="19"/>law-enforcement purposes by nonlaw enforcement activities and which is not within the scope of Sec. 806b.40(a) of this part. However, the Air Force must allow an individual access to any record that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information (unless doing so would reveal a confidential source).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">The (k)(3) exemption.</E> Applies to records maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President and other individuals under 18 U.S.C. 3506.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">The (k)(4) exemption.</E> Applies to records maintained solely for statistical research or program evaluation purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the rights, benefits, or entitlement of an individual except for census records which may be disclosed under 13 U.S.C. 8.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">The (k)(5) exemption.</E> Applies to investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. This provision allows protection of confidential sources used in background investigations, employment inquiries, and similar inquiries that are for personnel screening to determine suitability, eligibility, or qualifications.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">The (k)(6) exemption.</E> Applies to testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal or military service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">The (k)(7) exemption.</E> Applies to evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>

Commanders and supervisors should give consideration to those individuals with unlisted phone numbers, who do not want their number included on the office recall roster. In those instances, disclosure to the Commander or immediate supervisor, or deputy, should normally be sufficient.</P>

                <P>Computer matching programs electronically compare records from two or more automated systems that may include DoD, another Federal agency, or a state or other local government. A system manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse action against a Federal employee must meet these requirements of the Privacy Act:</P>

                <P>(2) Secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board;</P>

                <P>(4) Ensure full investigation and due process; and</P>
                <P>(5) Act on the information, as necessary.</P>

                <P>(c) Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact Air Force Chief Information Officer/P immediately. System managers must prepare a notice for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> with a Routine Use that allows disclosing the information for use in a matching program. Send the proposed system notice to Air Force Chief Information Officer/P. Allow 180 days for processing requests for a new matching program.</P>
                <P>(d) Record subjects must receive prior notice of a match. The best way to do this is to include notice in the Privacy Act Statement on forms used in applying for benefits. Coordinate computer matching statements on forms with Air Force Chief Information Officer/P through the Major Command Privacy Act Officer.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Part 806<E T="01">b</E>—General and Specific Exemptions</HD>
                <P>(a) All systems of records maintained by the Department of the Air Force shall be exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) to the extent that the system contains any information properly classified under Executive Order 12958 and that is required by Executive Order to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This exemption is applicable to parts of all systems of records including those not otherwise specifically designated for exemptions herein, which contain isolated items of properly classified information.</P>
                <P>(b) An individual is not entitled to have access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5)).</P>

                <P>(c) No system of records within Department of the Air Force shall be considered exempt under subsection (j) or (k) of the Privacy Act until the exemption rule for the system of records has been published as a final rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(d) Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Air Force will grant access to non-exempt material in the records being maintained. Disclosure will be governed by the Department of the Air Force's Privacy Instruction, but will be limited to the extent that identity of confidential sources will not be compromised; subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential violation will not be alerted to the investigation; the physical safety of witnesses, informants and law enforcement personnel will not be endangered, the privacy of third parties will not be violated; and that the disclosure would not otherwise impede effective law enforcement. Whenever possible, information of the above nature will be deleted from the requested documents and the balance made available. The controlling principle behind this limited access is to allow disclosures except those indicated above. The decisions to release information from these systems will be made on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>(e) General Exemptions. The following systems of records claim an exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), with the exception of F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records and F051 AF JA F, Courts-Martial and Article 15 Records. They claim both the (j)(2) and (k)(2) exemption, and are listed under this part:</P>
                <P>(1) System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI A, Counter Intelligence Operations and Collection Records.</P>

                <P>(2) System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI C, Criminal Records.<PRTPAGE P="28"/>

                <P>(3) System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI D, Investigative Support Records.</P>
                <P>(4) System identifier and name: F031 AF SP E, Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS).</P>
                <P>(i) Exemption: Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</P>
                <P>(ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</P>
                <P>(iii) Reasons: (A) To protect ongoing investigations and to protect from access criminal investigation information contained in this record system, so as not to jeopardize any subsequent judicial or administrative process taken as a result of information contained in the file.</P>
                <P>(B) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit the subject criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(C) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for subsection this subsection will not be applicable.</P>
                <P>(D) From subsection (d) because access the records contained in this system would inform the subject of an investigation of existence of that investigation, provide subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(E) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because system of records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act of 1974.</P>
                <P>(F) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been exempted from access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
                <P>(5) System identifier and name: F031 AF SF A, Correction and Rehabilitation Records.</P>
                <P>(i) Exemption: Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</P>
                <P>(ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</P>
                <P>(iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(B) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.</P>
                <P>(C) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(D) From subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential informants.</P>
                <P>(E) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j)(2) of the Privacy Act of 1974.</P>
                <P>(F) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</P>
                <P>(G) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment reporting on investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(H) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.</P>
                <P>(I) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>

                <P>(J) From subsection (g) because this system of records compiled for law enforcement <PRTPAGE P="29"/>purposes and has been exempted from the access provisions of subsections (d) and (f).</P>
                <P>(6) System identifier and name: F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records.</P>
                <P>(i) Exemption: (A) Parts of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</P>
                <P>(B) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source. Note: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f).</P>
                <P>(ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).</P>
                <P>(iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of accounting of disclosure would inform a subject that he or she is under investigation. This information would provide considerable advantage to the subject in providing him or her with knowledge concerning the nature of the investigation and the coordinated investigative efforts and techniques employed by the cooperating agencies. This would greatly impede the Air Force IG's criminal law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(B) From subsection (c)(4) and (d), because notification would alert a subject to the fact that an open investigation on that individual is taking place, and might weaken the ongoing investigation, reveal investigative techniques, and place confidential informants in jeopardy.</P>
                <P>(C) From subsection (e)(1) because the nature of the criminal and/or civil investigative function creates unique problems in prescribing a specific parameter in a particular case with respect to what information is relevant or necessary. Also, information may be received which may relate to a case under the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. The maintenance of this information may be necessary to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement purposes and to establish patterns of activity that may relate to the jurisdiction of other cooperating agencies.</P>
                <P>(D) From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information to the fullest extent possible directly from the subject individual may or may not be practical in a criminal and/or civil investigation.</P>
                <P>(E) From subsection (e)(3) because supplying an individual with a form containing a Privacy Act Statement would tend to inhibit cooperation by many individuals involved in a criminal and/or civil investigation. The effect would be somewhat adverse to established investigative methods and techniques.</P>
                <P>(F) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because this system of records is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) and (f).</P>
                <P>(G) From subsection (e)(5) because the requirement that records be maintained with attention to accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness would unfairly hamper the investigative process. It is the nature of law enforcement for investigations to uncover the commission of illegal acts at diverse stages. It is frequently impossible to determine initially what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and least of all complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light.</P>
                <P>(H) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this provision could present a serious impediment to law enforcement by revealing investigative techniques, procedures, and existence of confidential investigations.</P>
                <P>(I) From subsection (f) because the agency's rules are inapplicable to those portions of the system that are exempt and would place the burden on the agency of either confirming or denying the existence of a record pertaining to a requesting individual might in itself provide an answer to that individual relating to an ongoing investigation. The conduct of a successful investigation leading to the indictment of a criminal offender precludes the applicability of established agency rules relating to verification of record, disclosure of the record to that individual, and record amendment procedures for this record system.</P>
                <P>(J) From subsection (g) because this system of records should be exempt to the extent that the civil remedies relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which this rule exempts the system.</P>
                <P>(7) System identifier and name: F051 AF JA F, Courts-Martial and Article 15 Records.</P>

                <P>(i) Exemptions: (A) Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which <PRTPAGE P="30"/>performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsection of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</P>
                <P>(B) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f).</P>
                <P>(ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).</P>
                <P>(iii) Reason: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(B) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d), his subsection will not be applicable.</P>
                <P>(C) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(D) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal investigations information is often obtained concerning the violation of laws or civil obligations of others not relating to an active case or matter. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary that this information be retained since it can aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide valuable leads for other agencies and future cases that may be brought.</P>
                <P>(E) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection.</P>
                <P>(F) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential informants.</P>
                <P>(G) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974.</P>
                <P>(H) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</P>
                <P>(I) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(J) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.</P>
                <P>(K) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
                <P>(L) From subsection (g) because this system of records is compiled for law enforcement purposes and has been exempted from the access provisions of subsections (d) and (f).</P>

                <P>(i) Exemption: (A) Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency, which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Any portion of this system of records which falls within the provisions of 5 <PRTPAGE P="31"/>U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) may be exempt from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</P>

                <P>(B) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identify of a confidential source.

                <P>(iii) Reasons: From subsections (c)(3) and (d) because the exemption is needed to encourage those who know of exceptional medical or educational conditions or family maltreatments to come forward by protecting their identities and to protect such sources from embarrassment or recriminations, as well as to protect their right to privacy. It is essential that the identities of all individuals who furnish information under an express promise of confidentiality be protected. Granting individuals access to information relating to criminal and civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accounting, could interfere with ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it could result in the concealment, alteration, destruction, or fabrication of information; could hamper the identification of offenders or alleged offenders and the disposition of charges; and could jeopardize the safety and well being of parents and their children. Exempted portions of this system also contain information considered relevant and necessary to make a determination as to qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for Federal employment and Federal contracts, and that was obtained by providing an express or implied promise to the source that his or her <PRTPAGE P="33"/>identity would not be revealed to the subject of the record.</P>

Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; enable individuals to conceal their wrongdoing or mislead the course of the investigation; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation or proceeding.</P>

In general, the exemptions were claimed in order to protect properly classified information relating to national defense and foreign policy, to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative actions or investigations, to ensure protective services provided the President and others are not compromised, to protect the identity of confidential sources incident to Federal employment, military service, contract, and security clearance determinations, and to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of Federal evaluation materials. The exemption rule for the original records will identify the specific reasons why the records are exempt from specific provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.</P>

                <P>The Privacy Act Assessment. The Air Force recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of individuals, to ensure sufficient protections for the privacy of personal information as we implement citizen-centered e-Government. Privacy issues must be addressed when systems are being developed, and privacy protections must be integrated into the development life cycle of these automated systems. The vehicle for addressing privacy issues in a system under development is the Privacy Impact Assessment. The Privacy Impact Assessment process also provides a means to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing individual privacy.</P>
                <P>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this document is to:</P>
                <P>(1) Establish the requirements for addressing privacy during the systems development process.</P>
                <P>(2) Describe the steps required to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment.</P>
                <P>(3) Define the privacy issues you will address in the Privacy Impact Assessment.</P>
                <P>(b) Background. The Air Force is responsible for ensuring the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information. The Air Force recognizes that privacy protection is both a personal and fundamental right. Among the most basic of individuals' rights is an expectation that the Air Force will protect the confidentiality of personal, financial, and employment information. Individuals also have the right to expect that the Air Force will collect, maintain, use, and disseminate identifiable personal information and data only as authorized by law and as necessary to carry out agency responsibilities. Personal information is protected by the following:</P>

                <P>(1) Title 5, U.S.C. 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, which affords individuals the right to privacy in records maintained and used by Federal agencies.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section B—Privacy and Systems Development</HD>

                <P>System Privacy. Rapid advancements in computer technology make it possible to store and retrieve vast amounts of data of all kinds quickly and efficiently. These advancements have raised concerns about the impact of large computerized information <PRTPAGE P="40"/>systems on the privacy of data subjects. Public concerns about highly integrated information systems operated by the government make it imperative to commit to a positive and aggressive approach to protecting individual privacy. Air Force Chief Information Officer is requiring the use of this Privacy Impact Assessment in order to ensure that the systems the Air Force develops protect individuals' privacy. The Privacy Impact Assessment incorporates privacy into the development life cycle so that all system development initiatives can appropriately consider privacy issues from the earliest stages of design.</P>
                <P>(a) What is a Privacy Impact Assessment? The Privacy Impact Assessment is a process used to evaluate privacy in information systems. The process is designed to guide system owners and developers in assessing privacy through the early stages of development. The process consists of privacy training, gathering data from a project on privacy issues, and identifying and resolving the privacy risks. The Privacy Impact Assessment process is described in detail in Section C, Completing a Privacy Impact Assessment.</P>
                <P>(b) When is a Privacy Impact Assessment Done? The Privacy Impact Assessment is initiated in the early stages of the development of a system and completed as part of the required system life cycle reviews. Privacy must be considered when requirements are being analyzed and decisions are being made about data usage and system design. This applies to all of the development methodologies and system life cycles used in the Air Force.</P>
                <P>(c) Who completes the Privacy Impact Assessment? Both the system owner and system developers must work together to complete the Privacy Impact Assessment. System owners must address what data is to be used, how the data is to be used, and who will use the data. The system developers must address whether the implementation of the owner's requirements presents any threats to privacy.</P>
                <P>(d) What systems have to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment? Accomplish Privacy Impact Assessments when:</P>
                <P>(1) Developing or procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates information in identifiable form from or about members of the public.</P>
                <P>(2) Initiating a new collection of information, using information technology, that collects, maintains, or disseminates information in identifiable form for 10 or more persons excluding agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the Federal Government.</P>
                <P>(3) Systems as described above that are undergoing major modifications.</P>
                <P>(e) The Air Force or Major Command Privacy Act Officer reserves the right to request that a Privacy Impact Assessment be completed on any system that may have privacy risks.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section C—Completing a Privacy Impact Assessment</HD>
                <P>The Privacy Impact Assessment. This section describes the steps required to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment. These steps are summarized in Table A4.1, Outline of Steps for Completing a Privacy Impact Assessment.</P>
                <P>Training. Training on the Privacy Impact Assessment will be available, on request, from the Major Command Privacy Act Officer. The training consists of describing the Privacy Impact Assessment process and provides detail about the privacy issues and privacy questions to be answered to complete the Privacy Impact Assessment. Major Command Privacy Act Officers may use appendix E, Sections A, B, D, and E for this purpose. The intended audience is the personnel responsible for writing the Privacy Impact Assessment document.</P>
                <P>The Privacy Impact Assessment Document. Preparing the Privacy Impact Assessment document requires the system owner and developer to answer the privacy questions in Section E. A brief explanation should be written for each question. Issues that do not apply to a system should be noted as “Not Applicable.” During the development of the Privacy Impact Assessment document, the Major Command Privacy Act Officer will be available to answer questions related to the Privacy Impact Assessment process and other concerns that may arise with respect to privacy.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a as Amended</HD>
                <P>Title 5, U.S.C., 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires Federal Agencies to protect personally identifiable information. It states specifically:</P>
                <P>Each agency that maintains a system of records shall:</P>
                <P>Maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President;</P>
                <P>Collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs;</P>
                <P>Maintain all records used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination;</P>
                <P>Establish appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Definitions</HD>
                <P>Accuracy—within sufficient tolerance for error to assure the quality of the record in terms of its use in making a determination.</P>
                <P>Completeness—all elements necessary for making a determination are present before such determination is made.</P>
                <P>Determination—any decision affecting an individual which, in whole or in part, is based on information contained in the record and which is made by any person or agency.</P>
                <P>Necessary—a threshold of need for an element of information greater than mere relevance and utility.</P>
                <P>Record—any item, collection or grouping of information about an individual and identifiable to that individual that is maintained by an agency.</P>
                <P>Relevance—limitation to only those elements of information that clearly bear on the determination(s) for which the records are intended.</P>
                <P>Routine Use—with respect to the disclosure of a record, the use of such record outside DoD for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.</P>
                <P>System of Records—a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.</P>

                <P>Timeliness—sufficiently current to ensure that any determination based on the record will be accurate and fair.<PRTPAGE P="42"/>
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Information and Privacy</HD>
                <P>To fulfill the commitment of the Air Force to protect personal information, several issues must be addressed with respect to privacy.</P>
                <P>The use of information must be controlled.</P>
                <P>Information may be used only for a necessary and lawful purpose.</P>
                <P>Individuals must be informed in writing of the principal purpose and routine uses of the information being collected from them.</P>
                <P>Information collected for a particular purpose should not be used for another purpose without the data subject's consent unless such other uses are specifically authorized or mandated by law.</P>
                <P>Any information used must be sufficiently accurate, relevant, timely and complete to assure fair treatment of the individual.</P>
                <P>Given the availability of vast amounts of stored information and the expanded capabilities of information systems to process the information, it is foreseeable that there will be increased requests to share that information. With the potential expanded uses of data in automated systems it is important to remember that information can only be used for the purpose for which it was collected unless other uses are specifically authorized or mandated by law. If the data is to be used for other purposes, then the public must be provided notice of those other uses. These procedures do not in themselves create any legal rights, but are intended to express the full and sincere commitment of the Air Force to protect individual privacy rights and which provide redress for violations of those rights.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Data in the System</HD>
                <P>The sources of the information in the system are an important privacy consideration if the data is gathered from other than Air Force records. Information collected from non-Air Force sources should be verified, to the extent practicable, for accuracy, that the information is current, and complete. This is especially important if the information will be used to make determinations about individuals.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Access to the Data</HD>
                <P>Who has access to the data in a system must be defined and documented. Users of the data can be individuals, other systems, and other agencies. Individuals who have access to the data can be system users, system administrators, system owners, managers, and developers. When individuals are granted access to a system, their access should be limited, where possible, to only that data needed to perform their assigned duties. If individuals are granted access to all of the data in a system, procedures need to be in place to deter and detect browsing and unauthorized access. Other systems are any programs or projects that interface with the system and have access to the data. Other agencies can be International, Federal, state, or local entities that have access to Air Force data.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Attributes of the Data</HD>
                <P>When requirements for the data to be used in the system are being determined, those requirements must include the privacy attributes of the data. The privacy attributes are derived from the legal requirements imposed by The Privacy Act of 1974. First, the data must be relevant and necessary to accomplish the purpose of the system. Second, the data must be complete, accurate, and timely. It is important to ensure the data has these privacy attributes in order to assure fairness to the individual in making decisions based on the data.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Maintenance of Administrative Controls</HD>
                <P>Automation of systems can lead to the consolidation of processes, data, and the controls in place to protect the data. When administrative controls are consolidated, they should be evaluated so that all necessary controls remain in place to the degree necessary to continue to control access to and use of the data. Document record retention and disposal procedures and coordinate them with the Major Command Records Manager.</P>

              <P>This part prescribes the commanders' authority for enforcing order within or near Air Force installations under their jurisdiction and controlling entry to those installations. It provides guidance for use of military personnel in controlling civil disturbances and in supporting disaster relief operations. <PRTPAGE P="44"/>This part applies to installations in the United States, its territories and possessions, and will be used to the maximum extent possible in the overseas commands. Instructions issued by the appropriate overseas commander, status of forces agreements, and other international agreements provide more definitive guidance for the overseas commands. Nothing in this part should be construed as authorizing or requiring security forces units to collect and maintain information concerning persons or organizations having no affiliation with the Air Force other than a list of persons barred from the installation.</P>

                <P>(a) Air Force installation commanders are responsible for protecting personnel and property under their jurisdiction and for maintaining order on installations, to ensure the uninterrupted and successful accomplishment of the Air Force mission.</P>
                <P>(b) Each commander is authorized to grant or deny access to their installations, and to exclude or remove persons whose presence is unauthorized. In excluding or removing persons from the installation, the installation commander must not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Their action must be reasonable in relation to their responsibility to protect and to preserve order on the installation and to safeguard persons and property thereon. As far as practicable, they should prescribe by regulation the rules and conditions governing access to their installation.</P>

                <P>Under Section 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797), any directive issued by the commander of a military installation or facility, which includes the parameters for authorized entry to or exit from a military installation, is legally enforceable against all persons whether or not those persons are subject to the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Military personnel who reenter an installation after having been properly ordered not to do so may be apprehended. Civilian violators may be detained and either escorted off the installation or turned over to proper civilian authorities. Civilian violators may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 1382.</P>

                <P>Commanders are prohibited from authorizing demonstrations for partisan political purposes. Demonstrations on any Air Force installation for other than political purposes may only occur with the prior approval of the installation commander. Demonstrations that could result in interference with, or prevention of, the orderly accomplishment of the mission of an installation or that present a clear danger to loyalty, discipline or morale of members of the Armed Forces will not be approved.</P>

In a foreign country where a claimant is unable to obtain adequate assistance in filing a claim, the claimant may contact the nearest Air Force SJA. The SJA then advises AFLOA/JACC through claims channels of action taken and states why the DATT or MAAG was unable to adequately assist the claimant.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims payable.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Claims may be payable for loss of or damage to tangible personal property when the damage occurs incident to service. For loss of or damage to property to be incident to service, it must occur at a place and time that is connected to the service of an active duty military member or employment of a civilian employee.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authorized location.</E> Claims are only payable when the claimed property is located in an authorized location. There must be some connection between the claimant's service and the location of the claimed property. Duty locations where personal property is used, stored or held because of official duties are authorized places. Other authorized places may include:</P>
                <P>(1) Any location on a military installation not otherwise excluded.</P>
                <P>(2) Any office, building, recreation area, or real estate the Air Force or any other DoD element uses or controls.</P>
                <P>(3) Any place a military member is required or ordered to be pursuant to their duties and while performing those duties.</P>
                <P>(4) Assigned Government housing or quarters in the United States or provided in kind. The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act specifically prohibits payment for loss of or damage to property in quarters within the U.S. unless the housing or quarters are assigned or otherwise provided in kind. Base housing that has not been privatized is generally considered assigned or provided in kind wherever it is located.</P>
                <P>(i) Privatized housing or quarters within the United States subject to the Military Housing Privatization Initiative located within the fence line of a military installation or on federal land in which the DoD has an interest is considered assigned or otherwise provided in kind for the purposes of the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.</P>
                <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(5) Housing or quarters outside the United States. Outside the US, authorized off-base quarters, as well as assigned quarters, including quarters in U.S. territories and possessions, are authorized places. The residence of a civilian employee is not an authorized location if the employee is a local inhabitant.</P>
                <P>(6) Temporary duty (TDY) quarters and locations en route to the TDY destination. Significant deviations from the direct travel route are not authorized locations.</P>

                <P>(7) Permanent change of station (PCS) temporary quarters and locations enroute to the PCS destination. Significant deviations from the direct travel route are not authorized locations.<PRTPAGE P="56"/>
                </P>
                <P>(8) Entitlement and benefit locations. For these locations to be authorized, the claimant must be using them for the intended purpose and the property must be reasonably linked to that purpose.</P>
                <P>(9) Locations where personal property shipped or stored at government expense are found. Government facilities where property is stored at the claimant's expense or for their convenience without an entitlement are not authorized places.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Payable causes of loss incident to service.</E> Because the Personnel Claims Act (PCA) is not a substitute for private insurance, loss or damage at quarters or other authorized locations may only be paid if caused by:</P>
                <P>(1) An unusual occurrence;</P>
                <P>(2) Theft, vandalism or other malfeasance;</P>
                <P>(3) Hostile action;</P>
                <P>(4) A carrier, contractor, warehouseman or other transportation service provider storing or moving goods or privately owned vehicles at government expense;</P>
                <P>(5) An agent of the US; or</P>
                <P>(6) A permanent seizure of a witness' property by the Air Force.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Privately owned vehicles (POV).</E> Pay for damage to or loss of POVs caused by government negligence under subpart F or K. Pay under this subpart for damage or loss incident to:</P>
                <P>(1) Theft of POVs or their contents, or vandalism to parked POVs:</P>
                <P>(i) Anywhere on a military installation.</P>
                <P>(ii) At offbase quarters overseas.</P>
                <P>(iii) At other authorized places.</P>
                <P>(2) Government shipment:</P>
                <P>(i) To or from oversea areas incident to PCS.</P>
                <P>(ii) On a space available reimbursable basis.</P>
                <P>(iii) As a replacement vehicle under the provisions of the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR).</P>
                <P>(3) Authorized use for government duty other than PCS moves. The owner must have specific advance permission of the appropriate supervisor or official. Adequate proof of the permission and of nonavailability of official transportation must be provided prior to paying such claims. Claims arising while the claimant is deviating from the principal route or purpose of the trip should not be paid, but claims occurring after the claimant returns to the route or purpose should be paid. Travel between quarters and place of duty, including parking, is not authorized use for government duty.</P>
                <P>(4) Paint spray, smokestack emission, and other similar operations by the Air Force on a military installation caused by a contractor's negligence. (Process the claim under subpart F or K, if government negligence causes such losses.) If a contractor's operation caused the damage:</P>
                <P>(i) Refer the claim first to the contractor for settlement.</P>
                <P>(ii) Settle the claim under this subpart if the contractor does not pay it or excessively delays payment, and assert a claim against the contractor.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Damage to mobile or manufactured homes and contents in shipment.</E> Pay such claims if there is no evidence of structural or mechanical failure for which the manufacturer is responsible.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Borrowed property.</E> Pay for loss or damage to property claimants borrow for their use. Either the borrower or lender, if proper claimants, may file a claim. Do not pay for property borrowed to accommodate the lender, i.e., such as to avoid weight or baggage restrictions in travel.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Marine or aircraft incident.</E> Pay claims of crewmembers and passengers who are in duty or leave status at the time of the incident. Payable items include jettisoned baggage, clothing worn at the time of an incident, and reasonable amounts of money, jewelry, and other personal items.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Combat losses.</E> Pay for personal property losses, whether or not the United States was involved, due to:</P>
                <P>(1) Enemy action.</P>
                <P>(2) Action to prevent capture and confiscation.</P>
                <P>(3) Combat activities.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Civil activity losses.</E> Pay for losses resulting from a claimant's acts to:</P>
                <P>(1) Quell a civil disturbance.</P>
                <P>(2) Assist during a public disaster.</P>
                <P>(3) Save human life.</P>
                <P>(4) Save government property.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Confiscated property.</E> Pay for losses when:</P>

                <P>(1) A foreign government unjustly confiscates property.<PRTPAGE P="57"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) An unjust change or application of foreign law forces surrender or abandonmnet of property.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Clothing and accessories worn on the person.</E> Pay claims for damage to eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dentures the government did not supply, when the damage results from actions beyond the normal risks associated with daily living and working. Claimants assume the risk of normal wear and tear, and their negligence bars payment of the claim.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Money losses.</E> Pay claims for loss of money when the losses are due to theft from quarters, other authorized places, or from the person, if the claimant was required to be in the area and could not avoid the theft by due care. As a general rule, $200.00 is reasonable to have in quarters, and $100.00 is reasonable to have on the person unless:</P>
                <P>(1) The money was in a bona fide coin collection.</P>
                <P>(2) The claimant can justify possession of the money for a PCS move, extended TDY, vacation, extensive shopping trip, or similar circumstances. The claimant must show a good reason why the money had not been deposited in a bank or converted into travelers checks or a money order.</P>
                <P>(3) Local commercial facilities are not available or because U.S. personnel do not generally use such facilities.</P>

                <P>(a) A claim must be filed in writing within 2 years after it accrues. It is deemed to be filed upon receipt by The Judge Advocate General, AFLOA/JACC, or a Staff Judge Advocate of the Air Force. A claim accrues when the <PRTPAGE P="60"/>claimant discovers or reasonably should have discovered the existence of the act that resulted in the claimed loss. The same rules governing accrual pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act should be applied with respect to the Military Claims Act. Upon receipt of a claim that properly belongs with another military department, the claim is promptly transferred to that department.</P>
                <P>(b) The statutory time period excludes the day of the incident and includes the day the claim was filed.</P>
                <P>(c) A claim filed after the statute of limitations has run is considered if the U.S. is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim accrues or if the U.S. enters a war or armed conflict after the claim accrues, and if good causes shows how the war or armed conflict prevented the claimant from diligently filing the claim within the statute of limitations. But in no case will a claim be considered if filed more than two years after the war or armed conflict ends.</P>

                <P>(1) MCA claims arising from noncombat activities in the U.S. are not covered by the FTCA because more elements are needed to state an FTCA claim than are needed to state a claim under the MCA for noncombat activities.

                <P>(r) Is not in the best interests of the US, is contrary to public policy, or is otherwise contrary to the basic intent of the MCA. Examples include, but are not limited to, when a claimant's criminal conduct or failure to comply with a nonpunitive regulation is a proximate cause of the loss.

                <SUBJECT>Payment criteria.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following criteria is considered before determining liability.</P>
                <P>(a) The incident causing the damage or injury must arise in a foreign country and be caused by noncombatant activities of the U.S. Armed Forces or by the negligent or wrongful acts of civilian employees or military members of the Armed Forces.</P>
                <P>(1) It is a prerequisite to U.S. responsibility if the employee causing the damage or injury is a local inhabitant, a prisoner of war, or an interned enemy alien. These persons are “employees” within the meaning of the Foreign Claims Act (FCA) only when in the service of the United States. Ordinarily, a slight deviation as to time or place does not constitute a departure from the scope of employment. The purpose of the activity and whether it furthers the general interest of the United States is considered. If the claim arose from the operation or use of a U.S. Armed Forces vehicle or other equipment by such a person, pay it provided local law imposes liability on the owner of the vehicle or other equipment in the circumstances involved.</P>
                <P>(2) It is immaterial when the claim arises from the acts or omissions of any U.S. Armed Forces member or employee not listed in § 842.64(c)(1). The Act imposes responsibility on the United States when it places a U.S. citizen or non-US citizen employee in a position to cause the injury or damage. If the cause is a criminal act clearly outside the scope of employment, ordinarily pay the claim and consider disciplinary action against the offender.</P>
                <P>(b) Scope of employment is considered in the following situations.</P>

                <P>(1) It is a prerequisite to U.S. responsibility if the employee causing the damage or injury is a local inhabitant, a prisoner of war, or an interned enemy alien. These persons are “employees” within the meaning of the Foreign Claims Act (FCA) only when in the service of the United States. Ordinarily, a slight deviation as to time or place does not constitute a departure <PRTPAGE P="67"/>from the scope of employment. The purpose of the activity and whether it furthers the general interest of the United States is considered. If the claim arose from the operation or use of a U.S. Armed Forces vehicle or other equipment by such a person, pay it provided local law imposes liability on the owner of the vehicle or other equipment in the circumstances involved.</P>
                <P>(2) It is immaterial when the claim arises from the acts or omissions of any U.S. Armed Forces member or employee not listed in § 842.64(c)(1) of this part. The Act imposes responsibility on the United States when it places a U.S. citizen or non-US citizen employee in a position to cause the injury or damage. If the cause is a criminal act clearly outside the scope of employment, ordinarily pay the claim and consider disciplinary action against the offender.</P>

                <P>A claim is not payable when it:</P>
                <P>(a) Is waived under an applicable international agreement, or pursuant to an applicable international agreement, a receiving state should adjudicate and pay the claim. However, if a foreign government subject to such an international agreement disputes its legal responsibilities under the agreement, and the claimant has no other means of compensation, USAF/JACC may authorize payment.</P>
                <P>(b) Is purely contractual in nature.</P>
                <P>(c) Is for attorney fees, punitive damages, a judgment or interest on a judgment, bail, or court costs. FCC should consider providing early notice to claimants that attorney fees are not payable as an item of damage under the FCA.</P>
                <P>(d) Accrues from a private contractual relationship between U.S. personnel and third parties about property leases, public utilities, hiring of domestic servants, and debts of any description. This claim is sent for action to the commander of the person concerned (see 32 CFR part 818).</P>
                <P>(e) Is based solely on compassionate grounds.

                <P>(3) A U.S. contract or agreement providing employee benefits through insurance, local law, or custom, where the United States pays for them either directly or as part of the consideration under the contract. (See 42 U.S.C. 1651 and 42 U.S.C. 1701.) The Judge Advocate General or Chief, Claims and Tort Litigation Staff, AFLOA/JACC, may authorize an award where local benefits are not adequate. Local benefits are deducted from any award.</P>
                <P>(m) Results from an action by an enemy, or directly or indirectly from an act of the U.S. Armed Forces in combat, except that a claim may be allowed if it arises from an accident or malfunction incident to the operation of an aircraft of the U.S. Armed Forces, including its airborne ordnance, indirectly related to combat, and occurring while preparing for or going to, or returning from a combat mission.</P>
                <P>(n) Is based on negligence of a concessionaire or other independent contractor.</P>

                <P>(p) Is the subject of litigation against the United States or its employees. This restriction does not apply to joint criminal/civil proceedings in a foreign <PRTPAGE P="68"/>court. Claims settlement may be authorized by AFLOA/JACC in appropriate cases on request.</P>

                <P>(s) Is not in the best interest of the United States, is contrary to public policy, or otherwise contrary to the basic intent of the FCA. Claims considered not payable on this basis will be forwarded to USAF/JACC for final decision.</P>
                <P>(t) Is presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict with the United States, or any country allied with such enemy country unless the settlement authority determines the claimant is, and at the time of the incident was, friendly to the United States. Exception: A prisoner of war or interned enemy alien is not excluded from filing a claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property within the U.S. Armed Forces' custody if the claim is otherwise payable.</P>

But in no case will a claim be considered if filed more than two years after the war or armed conflict ends.</P>

                <P>(a) Claims covered by the FTCA, FCA, IACA, 10 U.S.C. 2734a and 2734b, Air Force Admiralty Claims Act (AFACA), 10 U.S.C. 9801-9804, 9806, MCA, 10 U.S.C. 2733, or covered under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act (MPCECA), 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3721.</P>

                <P>(b) NGCA claims arising from noncombat activities in the U.S. are not covered by the FTCA because more elements are needed to state an FTCA claim than are needed to state a claim under the NGCA for noncombat activities. All FTCA claims are based on elements of traditional tort liability (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> duty, breach, causation, and damages); that is, they are fault based. Noncombat activity claims under the NGCA are based solely on causation and damages. Because NGCA claims for noncombat activities are not fault based, they are not covered by the FTCA.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal preemption.</E> Many of the exclusions in this subpart are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680 or other federal statutes or court decisions interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act. Federal case law interpreting the same exclusions under the Federal Tort Claims Act is applied to the National Guard Claims Act.

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Applicable law.</E> When a claim arises in the United States, its territories or possessions, the same law as if the claim was cognizable under the FTCA will be applied.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Claims in foreign countries.</E> In claims arising in a foreign country, where the claim is for personal injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property caused by an act or omission alleged to be negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of military personnel or civilian officers or employees of the United States acting within the scope of their employment, liability or the United States is determined according to federal case law interpreting the FTCA. Where the FTCA requires application of the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, settlement authorities will use the rules set forth in the currently adopted edition of the <E T="03">Restatement of the Law,</E> published by the American Law Institute, to evaluate the liability of the Air Force, subject to the following rules:</P>
                <P>(i) Absolute or strict liability will not apply for claims not arising from noncombat activities.</P>
                <P>(ii) Hedonic damages are not payable.</P>
                <P>(iii) The collateral source doctrine will not apply.</P>
                <P>(iv) Joint and several liability does not apply. Payment will be made only upon the portion of loss, damage, injury or death attributable to the Armed Forces of the United States.</P>
                <P>(v) Future economic loss will be discounted to present value after deducting for federal income taxes and, in cases of wrongful death, personal consumption.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims not payable.</E> Do not approve payment for:</P>
                <P>(1) Punitive damages.</P>
                <P>(2) Cost of medical or hospital services furnished at U.S. expense.</P>
                <P>(3) Cost of burial expenses paid by the United States.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Settlement by insurer or joint tortfeasor.</E> When settlement is made by an insurer or joint tortfeasor and an additional award is warranted, an award may be made if both of the following are present:</P>
                <P>(1) The United States is not protected by the release executed by the claimant.</P>
                <P>(2) The total amount received from such source is first deducted.</P>

                <P>The following are considered nonassertable claims and should not be asserted:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Claims against any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States.</E> “Agency or instrumentality” includes any self-insured nonappropriated fund activity whether revenue producing, welfare, or sundry. The term does not include private associations.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Claims for care furnished a veteran by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for service connected disability.</E> However, claims may be asserted for the reasonable value of medical care an Air Force member receives prior to his or her discharge and transfer to the VA facility or when the Air Force has reimbursed the VA facility for the care.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims for care furnished a merchant seaman under 42 U.S.C. 249.</E> A claim against the seaman's employer should not be filed.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Government contractors.</E> In claims in which the United States must reimburse the contractor for a claim according to the terms of the contract, settlement authorities investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine if assertion is appropriate. If the U.S. is not required to reimburse the contractor, the MCR authority may assert a claim against the contractor.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Foreign governments.</E> Settlement authorities investigate any claims that <PRTPAGE P="82"/>might be made against foreign governments, their political subdivisions, armed forces members or civilian employees.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">U.S. personnel.</E> Claims are not asserted against members of the uniformed services; employees of the US, its agencies or instrumentalities; or an individual who is a dependent of a service member or employee at the time of assertion unless they have insurance to pay the claim, they were required by law or regulation to have insurance which would have covered the Air Force, or their actions, which necessitated the medical treatment provided at government expense, constituted willful misconduct or gross negligence.</P>

                <P>When asserting the claim, the base SJA will:</P>
                <P>(a) MCR personnel assert a claim against a tortfeasor or other third party using a formal letter on Air Force stationery. The assertion is made against all potential payers, including insurers. The demand letter should state the legal basis for recovery and sufficiently describe the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to medical care. Applicable bases of recovery include U.S. status as a third-party beneficiary under various types of insurance policies, workers' compensation laws, no-fault laws, or other Federal statutes, including Coordination of Benefits (COB) or FMCRA.</P>
                <P>(b) The MCR authority must promptly notify the injured parties or their legal representatives, in writing, that the United States will attempt to recover from the third parties the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished and that they:</P>
                <P>(1) Should seek advice from a legal assistance officer or civilian counsel.</P>
                <P>(2) Must cooperate in the prosecution of all actions of the United States against third parties.</P>
                <P>(3) Must furnish a complete statement regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident which caused the injury.</P>
                <P>(4) Must not execute a release or settle any claim which exists as a result of the injury without prior notice to the MCR authority.</P>
                <P>(c) Mail all copies of the SF 96, or claim notice on Air Force letterhead:</P>
                <P>(1) By certified mail with return receipt requested in all claims in which the amount claimed is $5,000.00 or more or in which there is a substantial likelihood that the final amount claimed will be $5,000.00 or more.</P>
                <P>(2) By regular or certified mail with return receipt requested at the SJA's discretion in cases in which the final amount claimed is less than $5,000.00, unless there is no response to the initial notice of claim within a reasonable period of time and a second notice of claim is required to be mailed. All second notices of claim and copies will be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested.</P>
                <P>(d) Notify the injured parties promptly in writing that the United States will attempt to recover from the third parties the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished and that they:</P>
                <P>(1) Should seek advice from a legal assistance officer or civilian counsel and furnish the civilian counsel's name to the claims officer.</P>

                <P>Waivers and compromises of government claims can be made. This section lists the basic guidance for each action. (See this subpart for claims involving waiver and compromise of amounts in excess of settlement authorities' delegated amounts.)</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Convenience of the Government.</E> When compromising or waiving a claim for convenience of the Government, settlement authorities should consider the following factors:</P>
                <P>(1) Risks of litigation.</P>
                <P>(2) Questionable liability of the third party.</P>
                <P>(3) Costs of litigation.</P>
                <P>(4) Insurance (Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist and Medical Payment Coverage) or other assets of the tortfeasor available to satisfy a judgment for the entire claim.</P>
                <P>(5) Potential counterclaim against the U.S.</P>
                <P>(6) Jury verdict expectancy amount.</P>

                <P>(9) Tortfeasor cannot be located.</P>
                <P>(10) Tortfeasor is judgment proof.</P>
                <P>(11) Tortfeasor has refused to pay and the case is too weak for litigation.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Hardship on the injured party.</E> When compromising or waiving a claim to avoid undue hardship on the injured party, settlement authorities should consider the following factors:</P>
                <P>(1) Permanent disability or disfigurement of the injured party.</P>
                <P>(2) Decreased earning power of the injured party.</P>
                <P>(3) Out of pocket losses to the injured party.</P>
                <P>(4) Financial status of the injured party.</P>
                <P>(5) Pension rights of the injured party.</P>
                <P>(6) Other government benefits available to the injured party.</P>
                <P>(7) An offer of settlement from a third party which includes virtually all of the thirty party's assets, although the amount is considerably less than the calculation of the injured party's damages.</P>
                <P>(8) Whether the injured party received excessive treatment.</P>
                <P>(9) Amount of settlement with proposed distribution, including reductions in fees or damages by other parties, medical providers, or attorneys in order to reduce the hardship on the injured party.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Compromise or waiver.</E> A compromise or waiver can be made upon written request from the injured party or the injured party's legal representative.</P>

                <P>A settlement authority may reconsider its previous action on a request for waiver or compromise whether requested or not. Reconsideration is normally on the basis of new evidence or discovery of errors in the waiver submission or settlement, but can be based upon a re-evaluation of the claim by the settlement authority.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Civil Air Patrol (CAP).</E> A federally chartered, non-profit corporation which was designated by Congress in 1948 as a volunteer civilian auxiliary of the Air Force.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Air Force noncombat mission.</E> Although not defined in any statute, an Air Force noncombat mission is any mission for which the Air Force is tasked, by statute, regulation, or higher authority, which does not involve actual combat, combat operations or combat training. The Air Force, in lieu of using Air Force resources, can use the services of the Civil Air Patrol to fulfill these type missions. When performing an Air Force noncombat mission, the Civil Air Patrol is deemed to be an instrumentality of the United States. In order for a mission to be a noncombat mission of the Air Force under this part, it must either:</P>
                <P>(1) Have a special Air Force mission order assigned, and, the Air Force must exercise operational control over the mission.</P>
                <P>(2) Involve a peacetime mission the Air Force is tasked to perform by higher authority which requires the expenditure of Air Force resources to accomplish, and the Air Force specifically approves the mission as a noncombat mission, and assigns the mission to the Civil Air Patrol to perform.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">CAP members.</E> CAP members are private citizens who volunteer their time, services, and resources to accomplish CAP objectives and purposes. The two primary categories of members are:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Cadets.</E> Youths, 13 years (or having satisfactorily completed the sixth grade) through 17 years of age, who meet such prerequisites as the CAP corporation may establish from time to time. Cadet status may be retained until age 21.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Seniors.</E> Adults, 18 years of age or older (there is no maximum age), who meet such prerequisites as the CAP corporation may establish from time to time, and who have not retained cadet status.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Liaison officers.</E> Active duty Air Force officers assigned to liaison duty at the national, regional, and wing (state) levels of CAP.</P>

                <P>(a) It is for property damage, personal injury, or death.</P>
                <P>(b) It is proximately caused by a CAP member.</P>
                <P>(c) It arises from an Air Force noncombat mission performed by the CAP, or arises from an authorized mission performed by the CAP for which specific coverage under this subpart is granted by AFLOA/JACC.</P>

              <P>This part establishes criteria and assigns responsibility for the provision of counsel, for the provision of bail, and for the payment of court costs and other necessary and reasonable expenses incident to representation in civil and criminal proceedings, including appellate proceedings, before foreign courts and foreign administrative agencies, which involve members of the Armed Forces, civilian personnel and dependents. Payment of fines is not authorized hereunder.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Statutory authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>10 U.S.C. 1037 provides authority for employment of counsel, and payment of counsel fees, court costs, bail, and other expenses incident to representation of persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice before foreign tribunals. For personnel not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, funds for similar expenses may be made available in cases of exceptional interest to the service concerned, upon prior application through the Judge Advocate General of the service concerned, to the appropriate service secretary.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 845.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Responsibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Requests for provision of counsel, provision of bail, or payment of expenses will ordinarily be made by the defendant or accused through appropriate channels to the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over him. This officer shall determine whether the request meets the criteria prescribed herein and, based upon such determination, shall take final action approving or disapproving the request. Within their geographical areas of responsibility, major commands in the interest of obtaining prompt and effective legal service may appoint as approval authority, instead of the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction, any subordinate officer having responsibility in a particular country for personnel subject to foreign criminal jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding the criteria prescribed below, an officer exercising approved authority may, in his discretion, deny a request for the provision of counsel, provision of bail or payment of expenses, where the otherwise eligible requestor is in an absent without leave or deserter status at the time of the request, or otherwise is not then subject to United States military control, and there is no reasonable basis for the belief that the requestor will return to United States military control at the conclusion of the proceedings of service of an adjudged sentence, if any.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in criminal cases.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Requests for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in criminal cases may be approved in pretrial, trial, appellate and posttrial proceedings in any one of the following criminal cases:</P>
              <P>(a) Where the act complained of occurred in the performance of official duty; or</P>
              <P>(b) Where the sentence which is normally imposed includes confinement, whether or not such sentence is suspended; or</P>
              <P>(c) Where capital punishment might be imposed; or</P>
              <P>(d) Where an appeal is made from any proceeding in which there appears to have been a denial of the substantial rights of the accused; or</P>
              <P>(e) Where conviction of the offense alleged could later form the basis for administrative discharge proceedings for misconduct as a result of civil court disposition; or</P>
              <P>(f) Where the case, although not within the criteria established in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, is considered to have significant impact upon the relations of US forces with the host country or is considered to involve any other particular US interest.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Provision of bail in criminal cases.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Funds for the posting of bail or bond to secure the release of personnel from confinement by foreign authorities before, during, or after trial may be furnished in all criminal cases. Safeguards should be imposed to assure that at the conclusion of the proceedings or on the appearance of the defendant in court, the bail or bond will be refunded to the military authorities. Bail will be provided only to guarantee the presence of the defendant and will not be provided to guarantee the payment of fines or civil damages. Local US military authorities are expected to provide bail, in any case, only after other reasonable efforts have been made to secure release of pretrial custody to the US.</P>

              <P>Requests for provision of counsel and payment of expenses in civil cases may be granted in trial and appellate proceedings in either of the following civil cases:</P>
              <P>(a) Where the act complained of occurred in the performance of official duty; or</P>
              <P>(b) Where the case is considered to have a significant impact upon the relations of US forces with the host country or is considered to involve any other particular US interest. No funds shall be provided under this part in cases where the United States of America is in legal effect the defendant, without prior authorization of the Judge Advocate General.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 845.7</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for hiring counsel and obligating funds.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The selection of individual trial or appellate counsel will be made by the defendant. Such counsel shall represent the individual defendant and not the US Government. Selection shall be made from approved lists of attorneys who are qualified, competent and experienced in trial practice, and admitted for full practice, on their own account, before the courts of the foreign country involved. Normally, these lists will be coordinated with the local court or bar association, if any, and the appropriate US Diplomatic or Consular Mission and should include only those attorneys who are known or reputed, to comply with local attorney fee schedules or guides approved or suggested by local bar associations and should not exceed amounts paid under similar circumstances by nationals of the country where the trial is held. No fee may include any amount in payment for services other than those incident to representation before judicial and administrative agencies of the foreign country in the particular case for which the contract is made, and in no event may any contract include fees for representation in habeas corpus or related proceedings before tribunals of the United States. When appropriate and reasonable in the case, the payment of expenses, in addition to counsel fees, may include court costs, bail costs, charges <PRTPAGE P="89"/>for obtaining copies of records, printing and filing fees, interpreter fees, witness fees, and other necessary and reasonable expenses. Expenses will not include the payment of fines or civil damages, directly or indirectly.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever possible, the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee), acting on behalf of the United States of America, shall enter into a written contract with the selected counsel. The contract will cover counsel fees, and, when appropriate, may cover other costs arising in defense of the case only in the court of first instance and will not include fees for representation on appeal. If the case is appealed to higher tribunals, supplemental agreements shall be executed for each appeal. A copy of the contractual agreement shall serve as the obligating document.</P>
              <P>(c) If, for example, because of unusual circumstances or local customs, it is not practicable to enter into a written contract as in paragraph (b) of this section, action will be taken to record the agreement reached between the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee) and the selected counsel. This requirement may be met by a letter of commission or letter of understanding, executed between the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee) and the selected counsel, or by a written request for legal services expressly or impliedly accepted by the selected counsel. Any such document shall contain, if possible, an agreed estimate of counsel fees and reasonable expenses and a statement that both fees and expenses will conform to those paid by local nationals under similar circumstances and will not exceed local fee schedules, if any. If this document does not include an agreed estimate of counsel fees and other reasonable expenses, an estimate will be provided by the contracting officer. A copy of the document, together with the estimate, will be furnished the accounting component and will serve as the commitment document for the reservation of funds.</P>
              <P>(d) The provision of counsel and payment of expenses under this part is not subject to the provisions of the Defense Acquisition Regulation (subchapter A, chapter I of this title). However, the contract clauses set forth in part 5, section VII, Defense Acquisition Regulation, may be used as a guide in contracting.</P>
              <P>(e) Because of the desirability of timely procedural action, it is suggested that there be designated, from among the judge advocates on the staffs of officers responsible under § 845.3, contracting officers with contracting authority limited to agreements described in this section. The effect of this designation would be to combine within one office the duties of contracting officer and judge advocate.</P>
              <P>(f) Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting the selection of qualified local counsel employed by the United States Government, if the serviceman freely selects such counsel.</P>

              <P>Payment of bills submitted by the selected counsel and other costs shall be made in accordance with the general provision of AFM 177-102 (Commercial Transactions at Base Level), relating to payment of contractual obligations and pertinent disbursing regulations. All payments under these procedures will be in local currency. Acceptance of services procured under these procedures shall be certified to by the officer responsible under § 845.3 (or his designee). Payments of bail may be made when authorized by such officers. Such authorization shall be in the form of a directing letter or message citing 10 U.S.C. 1037.</P>

              <P>Authorized expenses incurred incident to implementation of the policies set forth in this part, including transportation and per diem expenses of trial observers, interpreters, and local counsel employees, shall be paid from appropriated funds of the service to which the defendant belongs. Payments shall be made from the appropriation current at time of payment, unless obligations for authorized costs have previously been established. Refunds shall be processed as appropriation refund. Such funds are chargeable to the base for operation and maintenance purposes (O&amp;M or R&amp;D, as applicable).</P>

              <P>No reimbursement will ordinarily be required from individuals with respect to payments made in their behalf under this part. However, prior to the posting of bail on behalf of a defendant, a signed agreement shall be secured from him wherein he agrees to remit the amount of such bail or permit the application of so much of his pay as may be necessary to reimburse the Government in the event that he willfully causes forfeiture of bail. In the event of such forfeiture, bail provided under this part shall be recovered from the defendant in accordance with that agreement. The agreement should include a statement that it does not prejudice the defendant's right to appeal to the Comptroller General of the United States and the courts after such payment or deduction has been made, if he considers the amount erroneous.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Air Force establishes and uses its airfields to support the scope and level of operations necessary to carry out missions worldwide. The Congress funds airfields in response to Air Force requirements, but also specifies that civil aviation access is a national priority to be accommodated when it does not jeopardize an installation's military utility. The Air Force engages in dialogue with the civil aviation community and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure mutual understanding of long-term needs for the national air transportation system and programmed military force structure requirements. To implement the national policy and to respond to requests for access, the Air Force must have policies that balance such requests with military needs. Civil aircraft access to Air Force airfields on foreign territory requires host nation approval.</P>
                <P>(a) The Air Force will manage two programs that are generally used to grant civil aircraft access to its airfields: civil aircraft landing permits and joint-use agreements. Other arrangements for access will be negotiated as required for specific purposes.</P>
                <P>(1) Normally, landing permits will be issued only for civil aircraft operating in support of official Government business. Other types of use may be authorized if justified by exceptional circumstances. Access will be granted on an equitable basis.</P>
                <P>(2) The Air Force will consider only proposals for joint use that do not compromise operations, security, readiness, safety, environment, and quality of life. Further, only proposals submitted by authorized local Government representatives eligible to sponsor a public airport will be given the comprehensive evaluation required to conclude a joint-use agreement.</P>

                <P>(3) Any aircraft operator with an inflight emergency may land at any Air Force airfield without prior authorization. An inflight emergency is <PRTPAGE P="92"/>defined as a situation that makes continued flight hazardous.</P>
                <P>(b) Air Force requirements will take precedence on Air Force airfields over all civil aircraft operations, whether they were previously authorized or not.</P>
                <P>(c) Civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields in the United States will be subject to Federal laws and regulations. Civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields in foreign countries will be subject to US Federal laws and regulations that have extraterritorial effect and to applicable international agreements with the country in which the Air Force installation is located.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) As the program manager for joint use, the Civil Aviation Branch, Bases and Units Division, Directorate of Operations (HQ USAF/XOOBC), ensures that all impacts have been considered and addressed before forwarding a joint-use proposal or agreement to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Installations (SAF/MII), who holds decision authority. All decisions are subject to the environmental impact analysis process as directed by the Environmental Planning Division, Directorate of Environment (HQ USAF/CEVP), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (SAF/MIQ). The Air Force Real Estate Agency (AFREA/MI) handles the leases for Air Force-owned land or facilities that may be included in an agreement for joint use.</P>
                <P>(b) HQ USAF/XOOBC determines the level of decision authority for landing permits. It delegates decision authority for certain types of use to major commands and installation commanders.</P>
                <P>(c) HQ USAF/XOOBC makes the decisions on all requests for exceptions or waivers to this part and related Air Force instructions. The decision process includes consultation with other affected functional area managers when required. Potential impacts on current and future Air Force policies and operations strongly influence such decisions.</P>
                <P>(d) Major commands, direct reporting units, and field operating agencies may issue supplements to establish command-unique procedures permitted by and consistent with this part.</P>

                <P>Air Force airfields are available for use by civil aircraft so far as such use does not interfere with military operations or jeopardize the military utility of the installation. Access will be granted on an equitable basis. Air Force requirements take precedence over authorized civil aircraft use. This part carries the force of US law, and exceptions are not authorized without prior approval from the Civil Aviation Branch, Bases and Units Division, Directorate of Operations, (HQ USAF/XOOBC), 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480. Proposed exceptions or waivers are evaluated as to current and future impact on Air Force policy and operations.</P>

The authorization cannot be transferred to a second or third party and does not extend to use for other purposes. An approved landing permit does not obligate the Air Force to provide supplies, equipment, or facilities other than the landing, taxiing, and parking areas. The aircraft crew and passengers are only authorized activities at the installation directly related to the purpose for which use is granted. All users are expected to submit their application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402) at least 30 days before intended use and, except for use as a weather alternate, CRAF alternate, or emergency landing site, must contact the appropriate installation commander or a designated representative for final landing approval at least 24 hours before arrival. Failure to comply with either time limit may result in denied landing rights.</P>

                <P>The purposes of use normally associated with civil aircraft operations at Air Force airfields are listed in Table 1. Requests for use for purposes other than those listed will be considered and may be approved if warranted by unique circumstances. A separate DD Form 2401 is required for each purpose of use.

                <SUBJECT>Insurance requirements.</SUBJECT>

                <P>Applicants must provide proof of third-party liability insurance on a DD Form 2400, with the amounts stated in <PRTPAGE P="96"/>US dollars. The policy number, effective date, and expiration date are required. The statement “until canceled” may be used in lieu of a specific expiration date. The geographic coverage must include the area where the Air Force airfield of proposed use is located. If several aircraft or aircraft types are included under the same policy, a statement such as “all aircraft owned,” “all aircraft owned and or operated,” “all non-owned aircraft,” or “all aircraft operated,” may be used in lieu of aircraft registration numbers. To meet the insurance requirements, either split limit coverage for bodily injury (individuals outside the aircraft), property damage, and passengers, or a single limit coverage is required. The coverage will be at the expense of the user with an insurance company acceptable to the Air Force. Coverage must be current during the period the Air Force airfield will be used. The liability required is computed on the basis of aircraft maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW) and passenger or cargo configuration. Minimum coverage will not be less than the amount indicated in Table 2 to this part.</P>
                <P>(a) Any insurance presented as a single limit of liability or a combination of primary and excess coverage will be an amount equal to or greater than the each accident minimums indicated in Table 2 to this part for bodily injury (individuals outside the aircraft), property damage, and passengers.</P>
                <P>(b) The policy will specifically provide that:</P>
                <P>(1) The insurer waives any right of subrogation it may have against the US by reason of any payment made under the policy for injury, death, or property damage that might arise, out of or in connection with the insured's use of any Air Force airfield.</P>
                <P>(2) The insurance afforded by the policy applies to the liability assumed by the insured under DD Form 2402.</P>
                <P>(3) If the insurer or the insured cancels or reduces the amount of insurance afforded under the listed policy before the expiration date indicated on DD Form 2400, the insurer will send written notice of policy cancellation or coverage reduction to the Air Force approving authority at least 30 days before the effective date of the cancellation or reduction. The policy must state that any cancellation or reduction will not be effective until at least 30 days after such notice is sent.</P>

                <P>Upon receipt of an application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402) for use of an Air Force airfield, the decision authority:</P>
                <P>(a) Determines the availability of the airfield and its capability to accommodate the purpose of use requested.</P>
                <P>(b) Determines the validity of the request and ensures all entries on DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402 are in conformance with this part.</P>
                <P>(c) Approves DD Form 2401 (with conditions or limitations noted) by completing all items in Section II—For Use by Approving Authority as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Period of Use (Block 7): The “From” date will be either the first day of approved use or the first day of insurance coverage. The “From” date cannot precede the first day of insurance coverage shown on the DD Form 2400. The “Thru” date is determined by the insurance expiration date and or the purpose of use. For example, the period of use for participants in an Air Force open house will be determined by both insurance coverage and open house dates. The permit would be issued only for the duration of the open house but must not precede or exceed the dates of insurance coverage. Many insurance policies terminate at noon on the expiration date. Therefore, if the insurance expiration is used to determine the permit expiration date, the landing permit will expire one day before the insurance expiration date shown on the DD Form 2400. If the insurance expiration date either exceeds 2 years or is indefinite (for example, “until canceled”), the landing permit will expire 2 years from the issue date or first day of coverage.</P>
                <P>(2) Frequency of Use (Block 8) is normally “as required” but may be more specific, such as “one time.”</P>

                <P>(3) Identification Number (Block 9): Installation commanders or a designated representative assign a permit number comprised of the last three letters of the installation's International <PRTPAGE P="97"/>Civil Aviation Organization identifier code, the last two digits of the calendar year, a number sequentially assigned, and the letter suffix that indicates the purpose of use (Table 1); for example, ADW 95-01C. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and USDAOs use a three position organization abbreviation; such as AMC 95-02K.</P>
                <P>(4) DD Form 2400 (Dated and Filed) (Block 11a): This block should contain the date from block 1 (Date Issued) on the DD Form 2400 and the identification of the unit or base where the form was approved; i.e., 30 March 1995, HQ USAF/XOOBC.</P>
                <P>(5) DD Form 2402 (Dated and Filed) (Block 11b): This block should contain the date from block 4 (Date Signed) on the DD Form 2402 and the identification of the unit or base where the form was approved; i.e., 30 March 1995, HQ USAF/XOOBC.</P>
                <P>(6) SA-ALC/SFR, 1014 Andrews Road, Building 1621, Kelly AFB TX 78241-5603 publishes the list of companies authorized to purchase Air Force fuel on credit. Block 12 should be marked “yes” only if the permit holder's name appears on the SA-ALC list.</P>
                <P>(7) Landing Fees, Block 13, should be marked as indicated in Table 1 to this part.</P>
                <P>(8) Permit Amendments: New entries or revisions to an approved DD Form 2401 may be made only by or with the consent of the approving authority.</P>
                <P>(d) Provides the applicant with written disapproval if:</P>
                <P>(1) Use will interfere with operations, security, or safety.</P>
                <P>(2) Adequate civil facilities are collocated.</P>
                <P>(3) Purpose of use is not official Government business and adequate civil facilities are available in the proximity of the requested Air Force airfield.</P>
                <P>(4) Use will constitute competition with civil airports or air carriers.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Unauthorized landings.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Unauthorized landing procedures.</E> The installation commander or a designated representative will identify an unauthorized landing as either an emergency landing, an inadvertent landing, or an intentional landing. An <PRTPAGE P="98"/>unauthorized landing may be designated as inadvertent or intentional whether or not the operator has knowledge of the provisions of this part, and whether or not the operator filed a flight plan identifying the installation as a destination. Aircraft must depart the installation as soon as practical. On all unauthorized landings, the installation commander or a designated representative:</P>
                <P>(1) Informs the operator of subpart  B procedures and the requirement for notifying the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as specified in section 6 of the FAA Airman's Information Manual.</P>
                <P>(2) Notifies the Federal Aviation Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) by telephone or telefax, followed by written notification using FAA Form 8020-9, 8020-11, or 8020-17, as appropriate. A copy of the written notification must be provided to HQ USAF/XOOBC.</P>
                <P>(3) Ensures the operator completes a DD Form 2402, and collects applicable charges. (In some instances, it may be necessary to arrange to bill the user for the appropriate charges.) DD Form 2402 need not be completed for commercial carriers if it is known that the form is already on file at HQ USAF/XOOBC.</P>
                <P>(4) In a foreign country, notifies the local US Defense Attache Office (USDAO) by telephone or telefax and, where applicable, the appropriate USDAO in the country of aircraft registry, followed by written notification with an information copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC and the civil aviation authority of the country or countries concerned.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergency landings.</E> Any aircraft operator who experiences an inflight emergency may land at any Air Force airfield without prior authorization (approved DD Form 2401 and 24 hours prior notice). An inflight emergency is defined as a situation that makes continued flight hazardous.</P>
                <P>(1) The Air Force will use any method or means to clear an aircraft or wreckage from the runway to preclude interference with essential military operations after coordinating with the FSDO and National Transportation Safety Board. Removal efforts will minimize damage to the aircraft or wreckage; however, military or other operational factors may be overriding.</P>
                <P>(2) An operator making an emergency landing:</P>
                <P>(i) Is not charged a landing fee.</P>
                <P>(ii) Pays all costs for labor, material, parts, use of equipment and tools, and so forth, to include, but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(A) Spreading foam on the runway.</P>
                <P>(B) Damage to runway, lighting, and navigation aids.</P>
                <P>(C) Rescue, crash, and fire control services.</P>
                <P>(D) Movement and storage of aircraft.</P>
                <P>(E) Performance of minor maintenance.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Inadvertent unauthorized landings.</E> (1) The installation commander or a designated representative may determine a landing to be inadvertent if the aircraft operator:</P>
                <P>(i) Landed due to flight disorientation.</P>
                <P>(ii) Mistook the Air Force airfield for a civil airport.</P>
                <P>(2) Normal landing fees must be charged and an unauthorized landing fee may be assessed to compensate the Government for the added time, effort, and risk involved in the inadvertent landing. Only the unauthorized landing fee may be waived by the installation commander or a designated representative if, after interviewing the pilot-in-command and appropriate Government personnel, it is determined that flying safety was not significantly impaired. The pilot-in-command may appeal the imposition of an unauthorized landing fee for an inadvertent landing to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU whose decision will be final. A subsequent inadvertent landing will be processed as an intentional unauthorized landing.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Intentional unauthorized landings.</E> (1) The installation commander may categorize an unauthorized landing as intentional when there is unequivocal evidence that the pilot deliberately:</P>

                <P>(i) Landed without an approved DD Form 2401 on board the aircraft.<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Landed for a purpose not approved on the DD Form 2401.</P>
                <P>(iii) Operated an aircraft not of a model or registration number on the approved DD Form 2401.</P>
                <P>(iv) Did not request or obtain the required final approval from the installation commander or a designated representative at least 24 hours before aircraft arrival.</P>
                <P>(v) Did not obtain landing clearance from the air traffic control tower.</P>
                <P>(vi) Landed with an expired DD Form 2401.</P>
                <P>(vii) Obtained landing authorization through fraudulent methods, or</P>
                <P>(viii) Landed after having been denied a request to land from any Air Force authority, including the control tower.</P>
                <P>(2) Normal landing fees and an unauthorized landing fee must be charged. Intentional unauthorized landings increase reporting, processing, and staffing costs; therefore, the unauthorized landing fee for paragraph (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(vi) of this section will be increased by 100 percent. The unauthorized landing fee will be increased 200 percent for paragraph (d)(1)(vii) and (d)(1)(viii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Intentional unauthorized landings may be prosecuted as a criminal trespass, especially if a debarment letter has been issued. Repeated intentional unauthorized landings prejudice the user's FAA operating authority and jeopardize future use of Air Force airfields.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Detaining an aircraft.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An installation commander in the United States, its territories, or its possessions may choose to detain an aircraft for an intentional unauthorized landing until:</P>
                <P>(1) The unauthorized landing has been reported to the FAA, HQ USAF/XOOBC, and the appropriate US Attorney.</P>
                <P>(2) All applicable charges have been paid.</P>
                <P>(b) If the installation commander wishes to release the aircraft before the investigation is completed, he or she must obtain bond, promissory note, or other security for payment of the highest charge that may be assessed.</P>
                <P>(c) The pilot and passengers will not be detained longer than is necessary for identification, although they may be permitted to remain in a lounge or other waiting area on the base at their request for such period as the installation commander may determine (normally not to exceed close of business hours at the home office of the entity owning the aircraft, if the operator does not own the aircraft). No person, solely due to an intentional unauthorized landing, will be detained involuntarily after identification is complete without coordination from the appropriate US Attorney, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU, and HQ USAF/XOOBC.</P>

                <P>The time that an aircraft spends on an installation is at the discretion of the installation commander or a designated representative but should be linked to the purpose of use authorized. Parking and storage may be permitted on a nonexclusive, temporary, or intermittent basis, when compatible with military requirements. At those locations where there are Air Force aero clubs, parking and storage privileges may be permitted in the area designated for aero club use without regard for the purpose of use authorized, if consistent with aero club policies. Any such permission may be revoked upon notice, based on military needs and the installation commander's discretion.</P>

                <P>(a) Landing, parking, and storage fees (Tables 3 and 4 to this part) are determined by aircraft maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW). All fees are normally due and collectible at the time of use of the Air Force airfield. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is used to deposit the fees with the base accounting and finance officer. In some instances, it may be necessary to bill the user for charges incurred.</P>

                <P>(b) Landing fees are not charged when the aircraft is operating in support of official Government business or for any purpose, the cost of which is subject to reimbursement by the US Government. Parking and Storage Fees (Table 4 to this part) are charged if an <PRTPAGE P="100"/>aircraft must remain beyond the period necessary to conduct official Government business and for all non-official Government business operations.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Joint-use agreements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>An agreement between the Air Force and a local Government agency is required before a community can establish a public airport on an Air Force airfield.</P>
                <P>(a) Joint use of an Air Force airfield will be considered only if there will be no cost to the Air Force and no compromise of mission capability, security, readiness, safety, or quality of life. Further, only proposals submitted by authorized representatives of local Government agencies eligible to sponsor a public airport will be given the comprehensive evaluation required to conclude a joint use agreement. All reviewing levels will consider and evaluate such requests on an individual basis.</P>
                <P>(b) Generally, the Air Force is willing to consider joint use at an airfield if it does not have pilot training, nuclear storage, or a primary mission that requires a high level of security. Civil operations must begin within 5 years of the effective date of an agreement. Operational considerations will be based on the premise that military aircraft will receive priority handling (except in emergencies), if traffic must be adjusted or resequenced. The Air Force normally will not consider personnel increases solely to support civil operations but, if accommodated, all costs must be fully reimbursed by the joint-use sponsor. The Air Force will not provide personnel to install, operate, maintain, alter, or relocate navigation equipment or aircraft arresting systems for the sole use of civil aviation. Changes in equipment or systems to support the civil operations must be funded by the joint-use sponsor. The Air Force must approve siting, design, and construction of the civil facilities.</P>

                <P>To initiate consideration for joint use of an Air Force airfield, a formal proposal must be submitted to the installation commander by a local Government agency eligible to sponsor a public airport. The proposal must include:</P>
                <P>(a) Type of operation.</P>
                <P>(b) Type and number of aircraft to be located on or operating at the airfield.</P>
                <P>(c) An estimate of the number of annual operations for the first 5 years.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 855.22</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Air Force procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Upon receipt of a joint-use proposal, the installation commander, without precommitment or comment, will send the documents to the Air Force Representative (AFREP) at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regional Office within the geographical area where the installation is located. AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management, <SU>8</SU>
                  <FTREF/> lists the AFREPs and <PRTPAGE P="101"/>their addresses. The installation commander must provide an information copy of the proposal to HQ USAF/XOOBC, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.</P>
                <FTNT>
                  <P>
                    <SU>8</SU> See footnote 1 to § 855.6.</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>(b) The AFREP provides comments to the installation commander on airspace, air traffic control, and other related areas, and informs local FAA personnel of the proposal for joint use.</P>
                <P>(c) The installation, the numbered Air Force, and the major command (MAJCOM) will then evaluate the proposal. The MAJCOM will send the comments and recommendations from all reviewing officials to HQ USAF/XOOBC.</P>
                <P>(d) Factors considered in evaluating joint use include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Impact on current and programmed military activities at the installation.</P>
                <P>(2) Compatibility of proposed civil aviation operations with present and planned military operations.</P>
                <P>(3) Compatibility of communications systems.</P>
                <P>(4) Instrument capability of crew and aircraft.</P>
                <P>(5) Runway and taxiway configuration. (Installations with single runways normally will not be considered for joint use.)</P>
                <P>(6) Security. The possibility for sabotage, terrorism, and vandalism increases with joint use; therefore, joint use will not be considered:</P>
                <P>(i) If military and civil aircraft would be collocated in hangars or on ramps.</P>
                <P>(ii) If access to the civil aviation facilities would require routine transit through the base.</P>
                <P>(7) Fire, crash, and rescue requirements.</P>
                <P>(8) Availability of public airports to accommodate the current and future air transportation needs of the community through construction or expansion.</P>
                <P>(9) Availability of land for civil airport complex.</P>
                <NOTE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                  <P>The majority of land required for a terminal and other support facilities must be located outside the installation perimeter or at a site that will allow maximum separation of military and civil activities. If the community does not already own the needed land, it must be acquired at no expense to the Air Force. The Air Force may make real property that is not presently needed, but not excess, available by lease under 10 U.S.C 2667. An application for lease of Air Force real property must be processed through the chain of command to the Air Force Real Estate Agency, 172 Luke Avenue, Suite 104, Building 5683, Bolling AFB DC 20332-5113, as prescribed in AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property <SU>9</SU>
                    <FTREF/>. All real property outleases require payment of fair market consideration and normally are processed through the Corps of Engineers. The General Services Administration must be contacted regarding availability of excess or surplus Federal real property and an application submitted through FAA for an airport use public benefit transfer under 49 U.S.C. § 47151-47153.</P>

                <P>(10) Sponsor's resources to pay a proportionate share of costs for runway operation and maintenance and other jointly used facilities or otherwise provide compensation that is of direct benefit to the Government.</P>
                <P>(e) When the Air Force determines that joint use may be compatible with its defense mission, the environmental impact analysis process must be completed before a final decision can be made. The Air Force will act as lead agency for the preparation of the environmental analysis (32 CFR part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process). The local Government agency representatives, working in coordination with Air Force personnel at the installation and other concerned local or Federal officials, must identify the proposed action, develop conceptual alternatives, and provide planning, socioeconomic, and environmental information as specified by the appropriate MAJCOM and HQ USAF/CEVP. The information must be complete and accurate in order to serve as a basis for the preparation of the Air Force environmental documents. All costs associated with the environmental studies required to complete the environmental impact analysis process must be paid by the joint use sponsor. Information on environmental analysis requirements is available from HQ USAF/CEVP, 1260 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1260.</P>

                <P>(f) HQ USAF/XOOBC can begin negotiating a joint-use agreement after the environmental impact analysis process is completed. The agreement must be <PRTPAGE P="102"/>concluded on behalf of the Air Force by SAF/MII as the approval authority for use of Air Force real property for periods exceeding 5 years. The joint-use agreement will state the extent to which the provisions of subpart B of this part, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, apply to civil aircraft operations.</P>
                <P>(1) Joint-use agreements are tailored to accommodate the needs of the community and minimize the impact on the defense mission. Although each agreement is unique, attachment 4 to this part provides basic terms that are frequently included in such agreements.</P>
                <P>(2) Agreements for joint use at Air Force airfields on foreign soil are subject to the requirements of AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements <SU>10</SU>

                <P>(g) HQ USAF/XOOBC and SAF/MII approval is required to amend existing joint use agreements. The evaluation and decision processes followed in concluding an initial joint-use proposal must be used to amend existing joint-use agreements.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Other agreements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Temporary use of Air Force runways occasionally is needed for extended periods when a local civil airport is unavailable or to accommodate special events or projects. Such use requires agreement between the Air Force and the local airport authority or other equivalent responsible entity.</P>
                <P>(b) The local proponent and Air Force personnel should draft and submit an agreement to the MAJCOM Director for Operations, or equivalent level, for review and comment. The agreement must address all responsibilities for handling aircraft, cargo, and passengers, and hold the Air Force harmless of all liabilities. The agreement will not exceed 3 years. Although each agreement will be unique, attachment 5 of this part provides one example. The draft agreement, with all comments and recommendations, must be sent to HQ USAF/XOOBC for final approval.</P>

                <P>This Joint Use Agreement is made and entered into this ____ day of ____ 19__, by and between the Secretary of the Air Force, for and on behalf of the United States of America (“Air Force”) and an airport sponsor (“Sponsor”) a public body eligible to sponsor a public airport.</P>
                <P>WHEREAS, the Air Force owns and operates the runways and associated flight facilities (collectively “flying facilities”) located at Warbucks Air Force Base, USA (“WAFB”); and</P>
                <P>WHEREAS, Sponsor desires to use the flying facilities at WAFB to permit operations by general aviation aircraft and commercial air carriers (scheduled and nonscheduled) jointly with military aircraft; and</P>
                <P>WHEREAS, the Air Force considers that this Agreement will be in the public interest, and is agreeable to joint use of the flying facilities at WAFB; and</P>
                <P>WHEREAS, this Agreement neither addresses nor commits any Air Force real property or other facilities that may be required for exclusive use by Sponsor to support either present or future civil aviation operations and activities in connection with joint use; and</P>
                <P>WHEREAS, the real property and other facilities needed to support civil aviation operations are either already available to or will be diligently pursued by Sponsor;</P>
                <P>NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Joint Use</HD>
                <P>a. The Air Force hereby authorizes Sponsor to permit aircraft equipped with two-way radios capable of communicating with the WAFB Control Tower to use the flying facilities at WAFB, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and those Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) applicable to civil aircraft operations. Civil aircraft operations are limited to 20,000 per calendar year. An operation is a landing or a takeoff. Civil aircraft using the flying facilities of WAFB on official Government business as provided in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, are not subject to this Agreement.</P>
                <P>b. Aircraft using the flying facilities of WAFB under the authority granted to Sponsor by this Agreement shall be entitled to use those for landings, takeoffs, and movement of aircraft and will normally park only in the area made available to Sponsor and designated by them for that purpose.</P>
                <P>c. Government aircraft taking off and landing at WAFB will have priority over all civil aircraft at all times.</P>
                <P>d. All ground and air movements of civil aircraft using the flying facilities of WAFB under this Agreement, and movements of all other vehicles across Air Force taxiways, will be controlled by the WAFB Control Tower. Civil aircraft activity will coincide with the WAFB Control Tower hours of operation. Any additional hours of the WAFB Control Tower or other essential airfield management, or operational requirements beyond those needed by the Air Force, shall be arranged and funded (or reimbursed) by Sponsor. These charges, if any, shall be in addition to the annual charge in paragraph 2 and payable not less frequently than quarterly.</P>
                <P>e. No civil aircraft may use the flying facilities for training.</P>
                <P>f. Air Force-owned airfield pavements made available for use under this Agreement shall be for use on an “as is, where is” basis. The Air Force will be responsible for snow removal only as required for Government mission accomplishment.</P>
                <P>g. Dust or any other erosion or nuisance that is created by, or arises out of, activities or operations by civil aircraft authorized use of the flying facilities under this Agreement will be corrected by Sponsor at no expense to the Air Force, using standard engineering methods and procedures.</P>

                <P>h. All phases of planning and construction of new runways and primary taxiways on Sponsor property must be coordinated with the WAFB Base Civil Engineer. Those intended to be jointly used by Air Force aircraft will be designed to support the type of military aircraft assigned to or commonly transient through WAFB.<PRTPAGE P="112"/>
                </P>
                <P>i. Coordination with the WAFB Base Civil Engineer is required for planning and construction of new structures or exterior alteration of existing structures that are owned or leased by Sponsor.</P>
                <P>j. Sponsor shall comply with the procedural and substantive requirements established by the Air Force, and Federal, State, interstate, and local laws, for the flying facilities of WAFB and any runway and flight facilities on Sponsor property with respect to the control of air and water pollution; noise; hazardous and solid waste management and disposal; and hazardous materials management.</P>
                <P>k. Sponsor shall implement civil aircraft noise mitigation plans and controls at no expense to and as directed by the Air Force, pursuant to the requirements of the WAFB Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) study; the FAA part 150 study; and environmental impact statements and environmental assessments, including supplements, applicable to aircraft operations at WAFB.</P>
                <P>l. Sponsor shall comply, at no expense to the Air Force, with all applicable FAA security measures and procedures as described in the Airport Security Program for WAFB.</P>
                <P>m. Sponsor shall not post any notices or erect any billboards or signs, nor authorize the posting of any notices or the erection of any billboards or signs at the airfield of any nature whatsoever, other than identification signs attached to buildings, without prior written approval from the WAFB Base Civil Engineer.</P>
                <P>n. Sponsor shall neither transfer nor assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Air Force.</P>

                <P>a. For the purpose of reimbursing the Air Force for Sponsor's share of the cost of maintaining and operating the flying facilities of WAFB as provided in this Agreement, Sponsor shall pay, with respect to civil aircraft authorized to use those facilities under this Agreement, the sum of (specify sum) annually. Payment shall be made quarterly, in equal installments.</P>
                <P>b. All payments due pursuant to this Agreement shall be payable to the order of the Treasurer of the United States of America, and shall be made to the Accounting and Finance Officer, WAFB, within thirty (30) days after each quarter. Quarters are deemed to end on December 31, March 31, June 30, and September 30. Payment shall be made promptly when due, without any deduction or setoff. Interest at the rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall be due and payable on any payment required to be made under this Agreement that is not paid within ten (10) days after the date on which such payment is due and end on the day payment is received by the Air Force.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Services</HD>
                <P>Sponsor shall be responsible for providing services, maintenance, and emergency repairs for civil aircraft authorized to use the flying facilities of WAFB under this Agreement at no cost to the Air Force. If Air Force assistance is required to repair an aircraft, Sponsor shall reimburse the Air Force for all expenses of such services. Any required reimbursement shall be paid not less frequently than quarterly. These charges are in addition to the annual charge specified in paragraph 2.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue</HD>
                <P>a. The Air Force maintains the level of fire fighting, crash, and rescue capability required to support the military mission at WAFB. The Air Force agrees to respond to fire, crash, and rescue emergencies involving civil aircraft outside the hangars or other structures within the limits of its existing capabilities, equipment, and available personnel, only at the request of Sponsor, and subject to subparagraphs b, c, and d below. Air Force fire fighting, crash, and rescue equipment and personnel shall not be routinely located in the airfield movement area during nonemergency landings by civil aircraft.</P>
                <P>b. Sponsor shall be responsible for installing, operating, and maintaining, at no cost to the Air Force, the equipment and safety devices required for all aspects of handling and support for aircraft on the ground as specified in the FARs and National Fire Protection Association procedures and standards.</P>
                <P>c. Sponsor agrees to release, acquit, and forever discharge the Air Force, its officers, agents, and employees from all liability arising out of or connected with the use of or failure to supply in individual cases, Air Force fire fighting and or crash and rescue equipment or personnel for fire control and crash and rescue activities pursuant to this Agreement. Sponsor further agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Air Force, its officers, agents, and employees against any and all claims, of whatever description, arising out of or connected with such use of, or failure to supply Air Force fire fighting and or crash and rescue equipment or personnel.</P>

                <P>d. Sponsor will reimburse the Air Force for expenses incurred by the Air Force for fire fighting and or crash and rescue materials expended in connection with providing such service to civil aircraft. The Air Force may, at its option, with concurrence of the National Transportation Safety Board, remove crashed civil aircraft from Air Force-owned <PRTPAGE P="113"/>pavements or property and shall follow existing Air Force directives and or instructions in recovering the cost of such removal.</P>
                <P>e. Failure to comply with the above conditions upon reasonable notice to cure or termination of this Agreement under the provisions of paragraph 7 may result in termination of fire protection and crash and rescue response by the Air Force.</P>
                <P>f. The Air Force commitment to assist Sponsor with fire protection shall continue only so long as a fire fighting and crash and rescue organization is authorized for military operations at WAFB. The Air Force shall have no obligation to maintain or provide a fire fighting, and crash and rescue organization or fire fighting and crash and rescue equipment; or to provide any increase in fire fighting and crash and rescue equipment or personnel; or to conduct training or inspections for purposes of assisting Sponsor with fire protection.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Air carrier.</E> Individuals or entities that operate commercial fixed and rotary wing aircraft in accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Chapter I) or equivalent regulations issued by a country's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and which provide air transportation or operational support services. Commercial air carriers under contract with, or operating on behalf of the DOD shall have a FAA or CAA certificate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Air transportation services.</E> The transport of DOD personnel or cargo by fixed or rotary wing commercial aircraft, where such services are acquired primarily for the transportation of DOD personnel and cargo, through donation or any form of contract, tender, blanket ordering agreement, Government charge card, Government or commercial transportation request (TR), bill of lading, or similar instruments. Air transportation services also include medical evacuation services, paratrooper drops, and charter airlift and group travel arranged by the Military Service Academies, foreign military sales, nonappropriated fund instrumentalities by other DOD and non-DOD activities for DOD personnel. All air carriers providing air transportation services to DOD must have a FAA or CAA certificate. The policy contained in this Directive shall not apply to individually procured, discretionary air travel, such as that associated with military leave or pass.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</E> The CAA refers to the organization within a country that has the authority and responsibility to regulate civil aviation. The term CAA is used throughout this part since these requirements are applicable to both U.S. and foreign carriers doing business with DOD. The term CAA thus includes the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Code sharing.</E> Code sharing is a marketing arrangement in which an air carrier places its designator code on a flight operated by another air carrier and sells tickets for that flight.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">DOD approval.</E> DOD approval in the context of this part refers to the process by which air carriers seeking to provide passenger or cargo airlift services (hereinafter referred to as air transportation services) to the DOD must be screened and evaluated by the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office or other entity authorized by the CARB, and approved for DOD use by the CARB. Once initial approval is obtained, a DOD approved air carrier must remain in an approved status to be eligible for DOD business. Although not generally required, the CARB or higher authority may, on a case-by-case basis, require DOD approval of air carriers providing operational support services to DOD.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">DOD air carrier safety and quality review process.</E> Includes four possible levels of review with increasing authority. The responsibilities of each are described in more detail in the reference in § 861.1 (b). These levels consist of the:</P>
              <P>(1) DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office;</P>
              <P>(2) DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board (CARB);</P>
              <P>(3) Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Transportation Command, or USCINCTRANS; and</P>
              <P>(4) Secretary of Defense. (<E T="04">Note:</E> A DOD-level body, the Commercial Airlift Review Authority, or CARA, provides advice and recommendations to the Secretary of Defense.)</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) International Safety Assessment (IASA) program and categories.</E> The FAA IASA program assesses the ability of a foreign country's CAA to adhere to international standards established by the United Nation's technical agency for aviation, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The FAA has established ratings for the status of countries as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Category 1—Does comply with ICAO standards.</E> A country's CAA has been found to license and oversee air carriers in accordance with ICAO aviation safety standards.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Category 2—Does not comply with ICAO standards.</E> A country's CAA does not meet ICAO standards for aviation oversight. Operations to the U.S. by a carrier from a Category 2 country are limited to those in effect at the time a country is classified as Category 2 and <PRTPAGE P="117"/>are subjected to heightened FAA surveillance. Expansion or changes in services to the U.S. are not permitted while a country is in Category 2 status unless the carrier arranges to have new services conducted by an air carrier from a Category 1 country. Category 2 countries that do not have operations to the U.S. at the time of the FAA assessment are not permitted to commence such operations unless it arranges to have its flights conducted by an air carrier from a Category 1 country.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-rated.</E> A country's CAA is labeled “non-rated” if it has not been assessed by the FAA.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">GSA City Pair Program.</E> A program managed by the General Services Administration in which U.S. air carriers compete for annual contracts awarding U.S. Government business for specific domestic and international scheduled service city pair routes.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Group travel.</E> Twenty-one or more passengers on orders from the same organization traveling on the same date to the same destination to attend the same function.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Letter of Warning.</E> A notice to a DOD approved air carrier of a failure to satisfy safety or airworthiness requirements which, if not remedied, may result in temporary nonuse or suspension of the air carrier by the DOD. Issuance of a <E T="03">Letter of Warning</E> is not a prerequisite to a suspension or other action by the CARB or higher DOD authority.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">On-site Capability Survey.</E> The most comprehensive evaluation performed by DOD's Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office. Successful completion of this evaluation is required of most air carriers before they may be approved to provide air transportation services to DOD. Once approved, air carriers are subject to periodic On-site Capability Surveys, as specified at Enclosure 3 in the reference in § 861.1(b).</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Operational support services.</E> Missions performed by air carriers that use fixed or rotary-winged aircraft to provide services other than air transportation services as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. Examples include, but are not limited to, range instrumentation and services, target-towing, sling loads, and electronic countermeasures target flights. Air carriers providing only operational support services do not require advance DOD approval and are not subject to the initial or periodic on-site survey requirements under this part, unless directed by the CARB or higher authority. All air carriers providing operational support services to DOD must have a FAA or CAA certificate and are required to maintain applicable FAA or CAA standards absent deviation authority obtained pursuant to 14 CFR 119.55 or similar CAA rules.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Performance assessments.</E> Reviews conducted by U.S. air carriers when evaluating foreign air carriers with which they have code share arrangements, using performance-based factors. Such assessments include reviewing a variety of air carrier data including history, safety, scope/size, financial condition, equipment, flight operations and airworthiness issues.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Performance evaluations.</E> Reviews conducted by DOD as directed in the references in § 861.1(a) and (b). These evaluations include a review of air carrier flight operations, maintenance departments, safety programs and other air carrier areas as necessary. Performance evaluations are not conducted on-site, but rely on information collected primarily from the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Preflight safety inspection.</E> A visual safety inspection of the interior and exterior of an air carrier's aircraft performed by DOD personnel in accordance with the references in § 861.1(a) and (b).</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Suspension.</E> The exclusion of an air carrier from providing services to the DOD. The period of suspension will normally:</P>
              <P>(1) Remain in effect until the air carrier furnishes satisfactory evidence that the conditions causing the suspension have been remedied and has been reinstated by the CARB, or;</P>
              <P>(2) Be for a fixed period of time as determined at the discretion of the CARB.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Temporary nonuse.</E> The immediate exclusion of a DOD approved air carrier from providing services to the DOD pending a decision on suspension. Normally, temporary nonuse will be for a <PRTPAGE P="118"/>period of 30 days or less. However, by mutual agreement of the CARB and the air carrier involved, a suspension hearing or decision may be delayed and the air carrier continued in a temporary nonuse status for an extended period of time.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Voluntarily provided safety-related information.</E> Information which consists of nonfactual safety-related data, reports, statements, and other information provided to DOD by an air carrier at any point in the evaluation process described in this Part. It does not include factual safety-related information, such as statistics, maintenance reports, training records, flight planning information, and the like.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 861.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>DOD air transportation quality and safety requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The DOD, as a customer of air transportation and operational support services, expects air carriers used by DOD to employ programs and business practices that not only ensure good service but also enhance the safety, operational, and maintenance standards established by applicable Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations. Accordingly, and as required by the references in § 861.1 (a) and (b), the DOD has established a set of quality and safety criteria and requirements that reflect the type programs and practices DOD seeks from air carriers providing services to DOD. Air carriers must meet and maintain these requirements in order to be eligible for DOD business. Air carriers providing air transportation services to DOD either directly by contract or agreement, or indirectly through the General Services Administration (GSA) City Pair Program or some other arrangement, must be approved by DOD prior to providing such services and remain in an approved status throughout the contract, agreement, or arrangement performance period. This approval entails successful completion of initial and recurring on-site surveys as well as periodic performance evaluations in accordance with the reference in § 861.1(b). The quality and safety criteria and requirements set forth in this part complement rather than replace the CAA criteria applicable to air carriers. Air carriers normally remain fully subject to applicable CAA regulations (CARs) while performing business for the DOD, even when the aircraft involved is used exclusively for DOD missions. The inspection and oversight criteria set forth in this part do not, as a general rule, apply to air carriers providing only operational support services to DOD. However, in the event concerns relating to the safety of such a carrier arise, the CARB or higher authority may, on a case-by-case basis, direct an appropriate level of oversight under the authority of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) The evaluation, quality and safety criteria and requirements set forth in this part apply to air carriers providing or seeking to provide air transportation services to DOD.</P>
              <P>(2) Foreign air carriers performing portions of GSA City Pair routes awarded to U.S. air carriers under a code-sharing arrangement, as well as foreign air carriers providing individually-ticketed passenger service to DOD personnel traveling on official business, may be subject to limited oversight and review pursuant to § 861.6.</P>
              <P>(3) The inspection and oversight requirements, as well as the quality and safety criteria of this part may, on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority, be applied to air carriers seeking to provide or providing operational support services as defined in § 861.3(l).</P>
              <P>(4) The inspection and oversight requirements of this part do not apply to aircraft engaged in medical transport services if procured under emergency conditions to save life, limb or eyesight. Likewise, the inspection and oversight requirements of this part are not applicable when DOD is not involved in the procurement of the medical transportation services. For example, when specific medical treatment is obtained on an individual basis by or for DOD personnel with medical transportation provided, as needed, at the direction of the non-DOD medical care giver. This includes situations where DOD, through TRICARE or otherwise, pays for such transportation as part of the costs of medical services provided.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope and nature of the evaluation program</E>—(1) <E T="03">Evaluation requirement.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="119"/>The provision of air transportation services under a contract or agreement with or on behalf of DOD, requires the successful completion of an initial on-site survey and approval by the CARB under this part in order to be eligible for DOD business. In addition, U.S. air carriers awarded contracts under the GSA City Pair Program, including those that perform part of the contract under a code-sharing arrangement with the U.S. air carrier awarded the contract, must successfully complete an initial on-site survey and be approved by the CARB for DOD use under this part prior to beginning performance of the GSA contract. Once approved by DOD, air carriers providing air transportation services are subject to recurring on-site surveys and performance evaluations and assessments throughout the duration of the relevant contract or agreement. The frequency and scope of these surveys and performance reviews will be in accordance with Enclosure 3 of the reference in § 861.1(b).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Office of primary responsibility.</E> Evaluations are performed by the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office located at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The mailing address of this office is HQ AMC/DOB, 402 Scott Drive Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL 62225-5302. The website address is <E T="03">https://public.scott.af.mil/hqamc/dob/index.htm.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Items considered in the evaluation process.</E> The specifics of the applicable DOD contract or agreement (if any), the applicable CAA regulations, and the experienced judgment of DOD personnel will be used to evaluate an air carrier's capability to perform services for DOD. The survey may also include, with the air carrier's coordination, observation of cockpit crew performance, as well as ramp inspections of selected company aircraft. In the case of air carriers seeking to provide air transportation services, after satisfactory completion of the initial survey and approval by the CARB as a DOD air carrier, follow-up surveys will be conducted on a recurring basis and when otherwise required to validate adherence to DOD quality and safety requirements. DOD personnel will also assess these quality and safety requirements when conducting periodic air carrier performance evaluations. The size of an air carrier, along with the type and scope of operations will be considered during the on-site survey. For example, while an air taxi operator may not have a formal flight control function, such as a 24-hour dispatch organization, that same air taxi operator is expected to demonstrate some type of effective flight following capability. On the other hand, a major air carrier is expected to have a formal flight control or dispatch function. Both, however, will be evaluated based on the effectiveness and quality of whatever flight following function they do maintain. In the case of air carriers seeking to provide operational support services, the type, scope and frequency of evaluation, if any, performed by DOD or other entity will be as directed by the CARB or higher authority.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Status of aircraft performing services for DOD.</E> All air carriers providing air transportation or operational support services to the DOD shall have FAA or CAA air carrier or commercial operator certificates and shall remain under FAA and/or CAA regulatory and safety oversight during performance of the DOD mission. Aircraft performing services for or on behalf of DOD shall be on the air carrier's operating certificate, and remain on that certificate while performing the DOD mission. The installation of any special equipment needed to perform services for DOD shall be FAA or CAA approved or an appropriate FAA or CAA waiver obtained.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Evaluation requirements.</E> The air carrier requirements stated in this part provide the criteria against which would-be DOD and GSA City Pair Program air carrier contractors, as well as air carriers providing services on behalf of DOD, may be subjectively evaluated by DOD. These requirements are neither all-inclusive nor inflexible in nature. They are not replacements for the certification criteria and other regulations established by the CAA. Rather, these requirements complement CAA certification criteria and regulations and describe the enhanced level of service required by DOD. The relative weight accorded these requirements in a given case, as well as the determination of whether an air carrier meets or exceeds them, is a matter <PRTPAGE P="120"/>within the sole discretion of the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office and the CARB, subject to the statutory minimums provided in the reference in § 861.1(a).</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—prior experience.</E> U.S. and foreign air carriers applying for DOD approval in order to conduct air transportation services for or on behalf of DOD under a contract or agreement with DOD, the GSA City Pair Program, or by some other arrangement are required to possess 12 months of continuous service equivalent to the service sought by DOD. In applying this requirement, the following guidance will be used by DOD authorities:</P>
              <P>(i) “12 months” refers to the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the request for DOD approval.</P>
              <P>(ii) “Continuous” service means the carrier must have performed revenue-generating services of the nature for which DOD approval is sought, as an FAA part 121, 125, 127, or 135 (14 CFR 121, 125, 127, or 135) air carrier (or foreign CAA equivalent if appropriate) on a recurring, substantially uninterrupted basis. The services must have occurred with such frequency and regularity as to clearly demonstrate the carrier's ability to perform and support sustained, safe, reliable, and regular services of the type DOD is seeking. Weekly flight activity is normally considered continuous, while sporadic or seasonal operations (if such operations are the only operations conducted by the carrier) may not suffice to establish a carrier's ability to perform and support services in the sustained, safe, reliable, and regular manner required by DOD. The ability of a carrier to perform services of the type sought by DOD may be called into question if there have been lengthy periods of time during the qualifying period in which the carrier has not operated such services. Consequently, any cessation, or nonperformance of the type of service for which approval is sought may, if it exceeds 30 days in length during the qualifying period and depending on the underlying factual circumstances, necessitate “restarting” the 12-month continuous service period needed to obtain DOD approval.</P>

              <P>(iii) “Equivalent to the services sought by DOD” means service offered to qualify for DOD approval must be substantially equivalent to the type of service sought by DOD. The prior experience must be equivalent in difficulty and complexity with regard to the distances flown, weather systems encountered, international and national procedures, the same or similar aircraft, schedule demands, aircrew experience, number of passengers handled, frequency of operations, and management required. There is not a set formula for determining whether a particular type of service qualifies. The performance of cargo services is not considered to be “substantially equivalent” to the performance of passenger services, and may not be used to meet the 12 continuous months requirement for passenger services. However, when a carrier already providing cargo services to DOD applies to carry passengers, the CARB may consider the carrier's cargo performance and experience in assessing whether a carrier is qualified to carry passengers on a specific type or category of aircraft, over certain routes or stage lengths, or under differing air traffic control, weather, or other conditions. The following examples are illustrative and not intended to reflect or predict CARB action in any given case:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>Coyote Air has operated commercial passenger commuter operations in the U.S. for a number of years flying a variety of twin-engine turboprop aircraft. They have also been a DOD-approved cargo carrier, providing international cargo services using DC-10 freighter aircraft. Coyote Air purchases a passenger version DC-10, and seeks DOD approval to provide international passenger service for DOD. The CARB may decide that although Coyote Air has provided passenger services for 12 continuous months, those services are not substantially equivalent to those being sought by DOD. While the carrier may have considerable operational experience with the DC-10, its commuter passenger operations are not substantially equivalent to the service now proposed—international passenger services on large jet aircraft.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>

                <P>Acme Air has been a DOD-approved cargo carrier for several years, operating domestic and international missions with MD-11 freighter aircraft. At the same time, Acme has been performing commercial international passenger services with B-757 <PRTPAGE P="121"/>aircraft. Acme Air purchases a MD-11 passenger aircraft and applies to perform passenger services for DOD using the MD-11. Assuming Acme has performed B-757 passenger service for 12 continuous months immediately preceding its application, the CARB may consider these passenger services substantially equivalent to those proposed since both involve the operation of large multi-engine aircraft in an international environment. The CARB may also consider Acme's operational history with its MD-11 freighter aircraft in determining whether the carrier is competent to provide MD-11 passenger service in the same environment.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(iv) Once approved by DOD, an air carrier's failure to maintain continuous operations of the type for which approval has been granted may, at the discretion of the CARB, be grounds for nonuse or suspension under this part, rendering the carrier ineligible for DOD business during the nonuse or suspension period. Any cessation or nonperformance of the type of service for which approval has been obtained may, if it exceeds 30 days in length and depending on the circumstances, provide the basis for the CARB to take appropriate action.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—air carrier management.</E> Management has clearly defined safety as the number one company priority, and safety is never sacrificed to satisfy passenger concern, convenience, or cost. Policies, procedures, and goals that enhance the CAA's minimum operations and maintenance standards have been established and implemented. A cooperative response to CAA inspections, critiques, or comments is demonstrated. Proper support infrastructure, including facilities, equipment, parts, and qualified personnel, is provided at the certificate holder's primary facility and en route stations. Personnel with aviation credentials and experience fill key management positions. An internal quality audit program or other method capable of identifying in-house deficiencies and measuring the company's compliance with their stated policies and standards has been implemented. Audit results are analyzed in order to determine the cause, not just the symptom, of any deficiency. The result of sound fiscal policy is evident throughout the company. Foreign code-sharing air carrier partners are audited at least every two years using DOD-approved criteria and any findings resolved. Comprehensive disaster response plans and, where applicable, family support plans, must be in place and exercised on a regular basis.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—operations</E>—(i) <E T="03">Flight safety.</E> Established policies that promote flight safety. These policies are infused among all aircrew and operational personnel who translate the policies into practice. New or revised safety-related data are promptly disseminated to affected personnel who understand that deviation from any established safety policy is unacceptable. An audit system that detects unsafe practices is in place and a feedback structure informs management of safety policy results including possible safety problems. Management ensures that corrective actions resolve every unsafe condition.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Flight operations.</E> Established flight operations policies and procedures are up-to-date, reflect the current scope of operations, and are clearly defined to aviation department employees. These adhered-to procedures are further supported by a flow of current, management-generated safety and operational communications. Managers are in touch with mission requirements, supervise crew selection, and ensure the risk associated with all flight operations is reduced to the lowest acceptable level. Flight crews are free from undue management pressure and are comfortable with exercising their professional judgment during flight activities, even if such actions do not support the flight schedule. Effective lines of communication permit feedback from line crews to operations managers. Personnel records are maintained and reflect such data as experience, qualifications, and medical status.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Flight crew hiring.</E> Established procedures ensure that applicants are carefully screened, including a review of the individual's health and suitability to perform flight crew duties. Consideration is given to the applicant's total aviation background, appropriate experience, and the individual's potential to perform safely. Freedom from alcohol abuse and illegal drugs is required. If new-hire cockpit <PRTPAGE P="122"/>crewmembers do not meet industry standards for experience and qualification, then increased training and management attention to properly qualify these personnel are required.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Aircrew training.</E> Training, including recurrent training, which develops and refines skills designed to eliminate mishaps and improve safety, is essential to a quality operation. Crew coordination training that facilitates full cockpit crews training and full crew interaction using standardized procedures and including the principles of Crew Resource Management (CRM) is required. Programs involving the use of simulators or other devices that can provide realistic training scenarios are desired. Captain and First Officer training objectives cultivate similar levels of proficiency. Appropriate emergency procedures training (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> evacuation procedures) is provided to flight deck and flight attendant personnel as a total crew whenever possible; such training focuses on cockpit and cabin crews functioning as a coordinated team during emergencies. Crew training—be it pilot, engineer, or flight attendant—is appropriate to the level of risk and circumstances anticipated for the trainee. Training programs have the flexibility to incorporate and resolve recurring problem areas associated with day-to-day flight operations. Aeromedical crews must also be trained in handling the specific needs of the categories of patients normally accepted for transportation on the equipment to be used. Trainers are highly skilled in both subject matter and training techniques. Training received is documented, and that documentation is maintained in a current status.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Captain upgrade training.</E> A selection and training process that considers proven experience, decision making, crew resource management, and response to unusual situations, including stress and pressure, is required. Also important is emphasis on captain responsibility and authority.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Aircrew scheduling.</E> A closely monitored system that evaluates operational risks, experience levels of crewmembers, and ensures the proper pairing of aircrews on all flights is required. New captains are scheduled with highly experienced first officers, and new or low-time first officers are scheduled with experienced captains. Except for aircraft new to the company, captains and first officers assigned to DOD charter passenger missions possess at least 250 hours combined experience in the type aircraft being operated. The scheduling system involves an established flight duty time program for aircrews, including flight attendants, carefully managed so as to ensure proper crew rest and considers quality-of-life factors. Attention is given to the stress on aircrews during strikes, mergers, or periods of labor-management difficulties.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">In-flight performance.</E> Aircrews, including flight attendants and flight medical personnel, are fit for flight duties and trained to handle normal, abnormal, and emergency situations. They demonstrate crew discipline and a knowledge of aviation rules; use company-developed standardized procedures; adhere to checklists; and emphasize safety, including security considerations, throughout all preflight, in-flight, and postflight operations. Qualified company personnel evaluate aircrews and analyze results; known performance deficiencies are eliminated. Evaluations ensure aircrews demonstrate aircraft proficiency in accordance with company established standards. Flight crews are able to determine an aircraft's maintenance condition prior to flight and use standardized methods to accurately report aircraft deficiencies to the maintenance activity.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Operational control/support.</E> Effective mission control includes communications with aircrews and the capability to respond to irregularities or difficulties. Clear written procedures for mission preparation and flight following aircraft and aircrews are provided. There is access to weather, flight planning, and aircraft maintenance data. There are personnel available who are knowledgeable in aircraft performance and mission requirements and that can correctly respond to emergency situations. There is close interface between operations and maintenance, ensuring a mutual awareness of aircraft operational and maintenance status. Procedures to notify <PRTPAGE P="123"/>DOD in case of an accident or serious incident have been established. Flight crews involved in such accidents or incidents report the situation to company personnel who, in turn, have procedures to evaluate the flight crew's capability to continue the mission. Aircraft involved in accidents or incidents are inspected in accordance with Civil Aviation Regulations and a determination made as to whether or not the aircraft is safe for continued operations.</P>
              <P>(ix) <E T="03">DOD charter procedures.</E> Detailed procedures addressing military charter requirements are expected. The level of risk associated with DOD charter missions does not exceed the risks inherent in the carrier's non-DOD daily flight operations. Complete route planning and airport analyses are accomplished, and actual passenger and cargo weights are used in computing aircraft weight and balance.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—maintenance.</E> Maintenance supervisors ensure all personnel understand that in spite of scheduling pressure, peer pressure, supervisory pressure, or other factors, the airplane must be airworthy prior to flight. Passenger and employee safety is a paramount management concern. Quality, completeness, and integrity of work are trademarks of the maintenance manager and maintenance department. Nonconformance to established maintenance practices is not tolerated. Management ensures that contracted maintenance, including repair and overhaul facilities, is performed by maintenance organizations acceptable to the CAA.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Maintenance personnel.</E> Air carriers are expected to hire and train the number of employees required to safely maintain the company aircraft and support the scope of the maintenance operations both at home station (the company's primary facility) and at en route locations. These personnel ensure that all maintenance tasks, including required inspections and airworthiness directives, are performed; that maintenance actions are properly documented; and that the discrepancies identified between inspections are corrected. Mechanics are fit for duty, properly certificated, the company verifies certification, and these personnel possess the knowledge and the necessary aircraft-specific experience to accomplish the maintenance tasks. Noncertified and inexperienced personnel received proper supervision. Freedom from alcohol abuse and illegal drugs is required.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Quality assurance.</E> A system that continuously analyzes the performance and effectiveness of maintenance activities and maintenance inspection programs is required. This system evaluates such functions as reliability reports, audits, component tear-down reports, inspection procedures and results, tool calibration program, real-time aircraft maintenance actions, warranty programs, and other maintenance functions. The extent of this program is directly related to the air carrier's size and scope of operation. The cause of any recurring discrepancy or negative trend is researched and eliminated. Action is taken to prevent recurrence of these discrepancies and preventive actions are monitored to ensure effectiveness. The results of preventive actions are provided to appropriate maintenance technicians.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Maintenance inspection activity.</E> A process to ensure required aircraft inspections are completed and the results properly documented is required. Also required is a system to evaluate contract vendors, suppliers, and their products. Inspection personnel are identified, trained (initial and recurrent), and provided guidance regarding inspector responsibility and authority. The inspection activity is normally a separate entity within the maintenance department.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Maintenance training.</E> Training is conducted commensurate with the size and type of maintenance function being performed. Continuing education and progressive experience are provided for all maintenance personnel. Orientation, familiarization, on-the-job, and appropriate recurrent training for all full and part-time personnel are expected. The use of such training aids as mockups, simulators, and computer-based training enhances maintenance training efforts and is desired. Training documentation is required; it is current, complete, well maintained, and <PRTPAGE P="124"/>correctly identifies any special authorization such as inspection and airworthiness release. Trainers are fully qualified in the subject manner.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Maintenance control.</E> A method to control maintenance activities and track aircraft status is required. Qualified personnel monitor maintenance preplanning, ensure completion of maintenance actions, and track deferred discrepancies. Deferred maintenance actions are identified to supervisory personnel and corrected in accordance with the criteria provided by the manufacturer or regulatory agency. Constant and effective communications between maintenance and flight operations ensure an exchange of critical information.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Aircraft maintenance program.</E> Aircraft are properly certified and maintained in a manner that ensures they are airworthy and safe. The program includes the use of manufacturer's and CAA information, as well as company policies and procedures. Airworthiness directives are complied with in the prescribed time frame, and service bulletins are evaluated for applicable action. Approved reliability programs are proactive, providing management with visibly on the effectiveness of the maintenance program; attention is given to initial component and older aircraft inspection intervals and to deferred maintenance actions. Special tools and equipment are calibrated.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Maintenance records.</E> Maintenance actions are well documented and provide a complete record of maintenance accomplished and, for repetitive actions, maintenance required. Such records as aircraft log books and maintenance documentation are legible, dated, clean, readily identifiable, and maintained in an orderly fashion. Inspection compliance, airworthiness release, and maintenance release records, etc., are completed and signed by approved personnel.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Aircraft appearance.</E> Aircraft exteriors, including all visible surfaces and components, are clean and well maintained. Interiors are also clean and orderly. Required safety equipment and systems are available and operable.</P>
              <P>(ix) <E T="03">Fueling and servicing.</E> Aircraft fuel is free from contamination, and company fuel facilities (farms) are inspected and results documented. Procedures and instructions pertaining to servicing, handling, and storing fuel and oil meet established safety standards. Procedures for monitoring and verifying vendor servicing practices are included in this program.</P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Maintenance manuals.</E> Company policy manuals and manufacturer's maintenance manuals are current, available, clear, complete, and adhered to by maintenance personnel. These manuals provide maintenance personnel with standardized procedures for maintaining company aircraft. Management policies, lines of authority, and company maintenance procedures are documented in company manuals and kept in a current status.</P>
              <P>(xi) <E T="03">Maintenance facilities.</E> Well maintained, clean maintenance facilities, adequate for the level of aircraft repair authorized in the company's CAA certificate are expected. Safety equipment is available in hangars, shops, etc., and is serviceable. Shipping, receiving, and stores areas are likewise clean and orderly. Parts are correctly packaged, tagged, segregated, and shelf life properly monitored.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—security.</E> Company personnel receive training in security responsibilities and practice applicable procedures during ground and in-flight operations. Compliance with provisions of the appropriate standard security program, established by the Transportation Security Administration or foreign equivalent, is required for all DOD missions.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—specific equipment requirements.</E> Air carriers satisfy DOD equipment and other requirements as specified in DOD agreements.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—oversight of commuter or foreign air carriers in code-sharing agreements.</E> Air carriers awarded a route under the Passenger Standing Route Order (PSRO) program, the GSA City Pair Program, or other DOD program, that includes performance of a portion of the route by a commuter or foreign air carrier with which it has a code-sharing arrangement, must have a formal procedure in place to periodically review and assess the code-sharing air carrier's safety, operations, and maintenance <PRTPAGE P="125"/>programs. The extent of such reviews and assessments must be consistent with, and related to, the code-sharing air carrier's safety history. These procedures must also provide for actual inspections of the foreign code-sharing air carrier if the above reviews and assessments indicate questionable safety practices.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Quality and safety requirements—aeromedical transport requirements.</E> (i) The degree of oversight is as determined by the CARB or higher authority. When an inspection is conducted, DOD medical personnel may also participate to assess the ability to provide the patient care and any specialty care required by DOD. The CARB's review will be limited solely to issues related to flight safety.</P>
              <P>(ii) Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs) used in the provision of medical services or treatment on board aircraft are tested for non-interference with aircraft systems and the results documented to show compliance with 14 CFR 91.21 or other applicable CAA regulations. If there are no CAA regulations, actual use/inflight testing of the same or similar model PED prior to use with DOD patients is the minimum requirement.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 861.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section establishes procedures to be used by the DOD when, in accordance with references in§ 861.1(a) and (b):</P>
              <P>(1) An air carrier is subject to review or other action by the DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board, or CARB;</P>
              <P>(2) A warning, suspension, temporary nonuse, or reinstatement action is considered or taken against a carrier by the CARB; or</P>
              <P>(3) An issue involving an air carrier is referred by the CARB to higher authority for appropriate action.</P>
              <P>(b) These procedures apply to air carriers seeking to provide or already providing air transportation services to DOD. It also applies to U.S. or foreign air carriers providing operational support services to DOD which, on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority, require some level of oversight by DOD.</P>
              <P>(c) An air carrier's sole remedy in the case of a suspension decision by the CARB is the appellate process under this part.</P>
              <P>(d) Quality and safety issues relating to air carriers used, or proposing to be used, by DOD, per reference (b) must be referred to the CARB for appropriate disposition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">CARB responsibilities.</E> As detailed in the reference in § 861.1(b), the CARB provides a multifunctional review of the efforts of the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office and is the first level decision authority in DOD on quality and safety issues relating to air carriers. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: the review and approval or disapproval of air carriers seeking initial approval to provide air transportation service to DOD; the review and approval or disapproval of air carriers in the program that do not meet DOD quality and safety requirements; the review and approval or disapproval of air carriers in the program seeking to provide a class of service different from that which they are currently approved; taking action to suspend, reinstate, or place into temporary nonuse or extended temporary nonuse, DOD approved carriers; taking action, on an as needed basis, to review, suspend, reinstate, or place into temporary nonuse or extended temporary nonuse, an air carrier providing operational support services to DOD; and, referring with recommendations, issues requiring resolution or other action by higher authority.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">CARB administrative procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Membership.</E> The CARB will consist of four voting members appointed by USCINCTRANS from USTRANSCOM and its component commands. These members and their alternates will be general officers or their civilian equivalent, with experience in the operations, maintenance, transportation, or air safety fields. A Chairman and alternate will be designated. Nonvoting CARB members will be appointed as necessary by USCINCTRANS. A non-voting recorder will also be appointed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Decisions.</E> Decisions of the CARB will be taken by a majority vote of the voting members present, with a minimum of three voting members (or their alternates) required to constitute <PRTPAGE P="126"/>a quorum. In the event of a tie, the Chair of the CARB will decide the issue.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Meetings of the CARB.</E> The CARB may meet either in person or by some electronic means. It will be convened by either USCINCTRANS or the Chair of the CARB. The meeting date, time, and site of the CARB will be determined at the time of the decision to convene the CARB. Minutes of CARB meetings will be taken by the recorder, summarized, and preserved with all other records relating to the CARB meeting. The recorder will ensure the air carrier and appropriate DOD and federal agencies are notified of the CARB's decision(s) and reasons therefore. In the event of a fatal accident, the CARB shall convene as soon as possible but not later than 72 hours after notification by the Chair.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">CARB operating procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Placing an air carrier into temporary nonuse.</E> (i) In case of a fatal aircraft accident or for other good cause, two or more voting members of the CARB may jointly make an immediate determination whether to place the air carrier involved into a temporary nonuse status pending suspension proceedings. Prior notice to the air carrier is not required.</P>
              <P>(ii) The carrier shall be promptly notified of the temporary nonuse determination and the basis therefore.</P>
              <P>(iii) Temporary nonuse status terminates automatically if suspension proceedings are not commenced, as set out in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, within 30 days of inception unless the CARB and air carrier mutually agree to extend the temporary nonuse status.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Suspension of an air carrier.</E> (i) On a recommendation of the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office or any individual voting member of the CARB, the CARB shall consider whether or not to suspend a DOD approved air carrier.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the CARB determines that suspension may be appropriate, it shall notify the air carrier that suspension action is under consideration and of the basis for such consideration. The air carrier will be offered a hearing within 15 days of the date of the notice, or other such period as granted by the CARB, at which the air carrier may be present and may offer evidence. The hearings shall be as informal as practicable, consistent with administrative due process. Formal rules of evidence do not apply.</P>
              <P>(iii) The types of evidence which may be considered includes, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) Information and analysis provided by the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office.</P>
              <P>(B) Information submitted by the air carrier.</P>
              <P>(C) Information relating to action that may have been taken by the air carrier to:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Correct the specific deficiencies that led the CARB to consider suspension; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Preclude recurring similar deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(D) Other matters the CARB deems relevant.</P>
              <P>(iv) The CARB's decisions on the reception or exclusion of evidence shall be final.</P>
              <P>(v) Air carriers shall have the burden of proving their suitability to safely perform DOD air transportation and/or operational support services by clear and convincing evidence.</P>
              <P>(vi) After the conclusion of such hearing, or if no hearing is requested and attended by the air carrier within the time specified by the CARB, the CARB shall consider the matter and make a final decision whether or not to suspend the air carrier or to impose such lesser sanctions as appropriate. The air carrier will be notified of the CARB's decision.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reinstatement.</E> (i) The CARB may consider reinstating a suspended carrier on either CARB motion or carrier motion, unless such carrier has become ineligible in the interim.</P>
              <P>(ii) The carrier has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that reinstatement is warranted. The air carrier must satisfy the CARB that the deficiencies, which led to suspension, have been corrected and that action has been implemented to preclude the recurrence of similar deficiencies.</P>

              <P>(iii) Air carrier evidence in support of reinstatement will be provided in a timely manner to the CARB for its review. The CARB may independently <PRTPAGE P="127"/>corroborate the carrier-provided evidence and may, at its option, convene a hearing and request the participation of the air carrier.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Appeal of CARB decisions.</E> (i) An air carrier placed in suspension by the CARB may administratively appeal this action to USCINCTRANS. An appeal, if any, must be filed in writing, with the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Office, and postmarked within 15 workdays of receipt of notice of the CARB's suspension decision. In the sole discretion of USCINCTRANS, and for good cause shown, the suspension may be stayed pending action on the appeal.</P>
              <P>(ii) Air carriers shall not be entitled to a de novo hearing or personal presentation before the appellate authority.</P>
              <P>(iii) The decision of the appellate authority is final and is not subject to further administrative review or appeal.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Referral of issues to higher authorities.</E> The approval or disapproval of an air carrier for use by DOD, the placing of approved carriers into temporary nonuse status, and the suspension and reinstatement of approved carriers, are all decisions which must be made by the CARB. Other matters may be referred by the CARB to USCINCTRANS for appropriate action, with or without recommendations by the CARB. The CARB will forward for decision, through USCINCTRANS to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&amp;L)), all air carrier use/nonuse recommendations involving foreign air carriers other than those providing charter transportation or operational support service to the Department of Defense.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 861.6</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>DOD review of foreign air carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Foreign air carriers providing or seeking to provide services to DOD shall be subject to review and, if appropriate, approval by DOD. Application of the criteria and requirements of this part and the degree of oversight to be exercised by DOD, if any, over a foreign air carrier depends upon the type of services performed and, in some instances, by the quality of oversight exercised by the foreign air carrier's CAA. The scope and frequency of the review of any given foreign air carrier under this part will be at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Foreign air carriers seeking to provide or providing air transportation services under a contract or Military Air Transportation Agreement with DOD, or pursuant to another arrangement entered into by, or on behalf of, DOD.</E> Foreign air carriers seeking to provide or providing air transportation services under a contract or Military Air Transportation Agreement with DOD, must meet all requirements of § 861.4, and be approved by the CARB in accordance with § 861.5. This includes foreign air carriers seeking to provide, or providing, airlift services to DOD personnel pursuant to an arrangement entered into by another federal agency, state agency, foreign government, international organization, or other entity or person on behalf of, or for the benefit of, DOD, regardless of whether DOD pays for the airlift services provided. For purposes of establishing the degree of oversight and review to be conducted under the DOD Commercial Air Transportation Quality and Safety Review Program, such foreign air carriers are considered the same as U.S. carriers. In addition, they must have an operating certificate issued by the appropriate CAA using regulations which are the substantial equivalent of those found in the U.S. FARs, and must maintain such certification throughout the term of the contract or agreement. The CAA responsible for exercising oversight of the foreign air carrier must meet ICAO standards as determined by ICAO, or the FAA under the FAA's International Aviation Safety Assessment Program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Foreign air carriers providing passenger services under the GSA City Pair Program.</E> Foreign air carriers performing any portion of a route awarded to a U.S. air carrier under the GSA City Pair Program pursuant to a code-sharing agreement with that U.S. air carrier, are generally not subject to DOD survey and approval under §§ 861.4 and 861.5. However, DOD will periodically review the performance of such foreign carriers. This review may consist of recurring performance evaluations, periodic examination of the U.S. <PRTPAGE P="128"/>code-sharing carrier's operational reviews and assessments of the foreign carrier and, where appropriate and agreed to by the air carriers concerned and DOD, on-site surveys of the foreign air carrier. Such carriers must also meet the 12 months prior experience requirement of § 861.4(e)(1). The CARB or higher authority may prescribe additional review requirements. Should circumstances warrant, use of these air carriers by DOD passengers on official business may be restricted or prohibited as necessary to assure the highest levels of passenger safety.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other foreign air carriers carrying individually ticketed DOD passengers on official business.</E> Foreign air carriers carrying individually ticketed DOD passengers on official business are not subject to DOD survey and approval under §§ 861.4 and 861.5. However, the DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Division may periodically review the performance of such carriers. Reviews may include voluntary on-site surveys as directed by the CARB or higher authority. In the event questions relating to the safety and continued use of the carrier arise, the matter may be referred to the CARB for appropriate action.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Foreign air carriers from countries in which the CAA is not in compliance with ICAO standards.</E> Unless otherwise authorized, use by DOD personnel on official business of foreign air carriers from countries in which the CAA is not in compliance with ICAO standards is prohibited except for the last leg into and the first leg out of the U.S. on such carriers. This includes foreign air carriers performing any portion of a route awarded to a U.S. air carrier under the GSA City Pair Program pursuant to a code-sharing agreement with that U.S. air carrier.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">On-site surveys.</E> The scope of the on-site survey of a foreign air carrier will be at the discretion of the CARB. In the event a foreign air carrier denies a request made under this part to conduct an on-site survey, the CARB will consider all available information and make a use/nonuse recommendation to DOD. If placed in nonuse status by DOD, such air carriers will not be used unless, in accordance with the reference in § 861.1 (b), in the judgment of the appropriate Combatant Commander, no acceptable alternative to using the carrier exists and the travel is mission essential.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Foreign carriers providing operational support services to DOD.</E> Such carriers are subject to DOD oversight, on a case-by-case basis, to the extent directed by the CARB or higher authority.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disclosure of voluntarily provided safety-related information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In accordance with paragraph (h) of the reference in § 861.1 (a), DOD may withhold from public disclosure safety-related information voluntarily provided to DOD by an air carrier for the purposes of this part if DOD determines that—</P>
              <P>(1) The disclosure of the information would, in the future, inhibit an air carrier from voluntarily providing such information to DOD or another Federal agency for the purposes of this part or for other air safety purposes; and</P>
              <P>(2) The receipt of such information generally enhances the fulfillment of responsibilities under this part or other air safety responsibilities involving DOD or another Federal agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Processing requests for disclosure of voluntarily provided safety-related information.</E> Requests for public disclosure will be administratively processed in accordance with 32 CFR part 806, Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Disclosure of voluntarily provided safety-related information to other agencies.</E> The Department of Defense may, at its discretion, disclose voluntarily provided safety-related information submitted under this part by an air carrier, to other agencies with safety responsibilities. The DOD will provide such information to another agency only upon receipt of adequate assurances that it will protect the information from public disclosure, and that it will not release such information unless specifically authorized.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This subpart sets up procedures for correction of military records to remedy error or injustice. It tells how to apply for correction of military records and how the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR, or the Board) considers applications. It defines the Board's authority to act on applications. It directs collecting and maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1034 and 1552. System of Records notice F035 SAFCB A, Military Records Processed by the Air Force Correction Board, applies.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Setup of the Board.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The AFBCMR operates within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force according to 10 U.S.C. 1552. The Board consists of civilians in the executive part of the Department of the Air Force who are appointed and serve at the pleasure of the Secretary of the Air Force. Three members constitute a quorum of the Board.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Board responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Considering applications.</E> The Board considers all individual applications properly brought before it. In appropriate cases, it directs correction of military records to remove an error or injustice, or recommends such correction.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Recommending action.</E> When an applicant alleges reprisal under the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. 1034, the Board may recommend to the Secretary of the Air Force that disciplinary or administrative action be taken against those responsible for the reprisal.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Deciding cases.</E> The Board normally decides cases on the evidence of the record. It is not an investigative body. However, the Board may, in its discretion, hold a hearing or call for <PRTPAGE P="130"/>additional evidence or opinions in any case.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Board actions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Board information sources.</E> The applicant has the burden of providing sufficient evidence of material error or injustice. However, the Board:</P>
                <P>(1) May get additional information and advisory opinions on an application from any Air Force organization or official.</P>
                <P>(2) May ask the applicant to furnish additional information regarding matters before the Board.</P>
                <P>(b) Applicants will be given an opportunity to review and comment on advisory opinions and additional information obtained by the Board. They will also be provided with a copy of correspondence to or from the Air Force Review Boards Agency with an entity outside the Air Force Review Boards Agency in accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1556.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Consideration by the Board.</E> A panel consisting of at least three board members considers each application. One panel member serves as its chair. The panel's actions and decisions constitute the actions and decisions of the Board.</P>
                <P>(d) The panel may decide the case in executive session or authorize a hearing. When a hearing is authorized, the procedures in § 865.4(f), of this part, apply.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Board deliberations.</E> Normally only members of the Board and Board staff will be present during deliberations. The panel chair may permit observers for training purposes or otherwise in furtherance of the functions of the Board.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Board hearings.</E> The Board in its sole discretion determines whether to grant a hearing. Applicants do not have a right to a hearing before the Board.</P>

                <P>(1) The Executive Director will notify the applicant or counsel, if any, of the time and place of the hearing. Written notice will be mailed 30 days in advance of the hearing unless the notice period is waived by the applicant. The applicant will respond not later than 15 days before the hearing date, accepting or declining the offer of a hearing and, if accepting, provide information pertaining to counsel and witnesses. The Board will decide the case in executive <PRTPAGE P="132"/>session if the applicant declines the hearing or fails to appear.</P>
                <P>(2) When granted a hearing, the applicant may appear before the Board with or without counsel and may present witnesses. It is the applicant's responsibility to notify witnesses, arrange for their attendance at the hearing, and pay any associated costs.</P>
                <P>(3) The panel chair conducts the hearing, maintains order, and ensures the applicant receives a full and fair opportunity to be heard. Formal rules of evidence do not apply, but the panel observes reasonable bounds of competency, relevancy, and materiality. Witnesses other than the applicant will not be present except when testifying. Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation. A recorder will record the proceedings verbatim. The chair will normally limit hearings to 2 hours but may allow more time if necessary to ensure a full and fair hearing.</P>

                <P>(4) Additional provisions apply to cases processed under 10 U.S.C. 1034. See DoDD 7050.06, <E T="03">Military Whistleblower Protection</E> <SU>2</SU>

                <P>(g) The Board will not deny or recommend denial of an application on the sole ground that the issue already has been decided by the Secretary of the Air Force or the President of the United States in another proceeding.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Board decisions.</E> The panel's majority vote constitutes the action of the Board. The Board will make determinations on the following issues in writing:</P>
                <P>(1) Whether the provisions of the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act apply to the application. This determination is needed only when the applicant invokes the protection of the Act, or when the question of its applicability is otherwise raised by the evidence.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether the application was timely filed and, if not, whether the applicant has demonstrated that it would be in the interest of justice to excuse the untimely filing. When the Board determines that an application is not timely, and does not excuse its untimeliness, the application will be denied on that basis.</P>
                <P>(3) Whether the applicant has exhausted all available and effective administrative remedies. If the applicant has not, the application will be denied on that basis.</P>
                <P>(4) Whether the applicant has demonstrated the existence of a material error or injustice that can be remedied effectively through correction of the applicant's military record and, if so, what corrections are needed to provide full and effective relief.</P>
                <P>(5) In Military Whistleblowers Protection Act cases only, whether to recommend to the Secretary of the Air Force that disciplinary or administrative action be taken against any Air Force official whom the Board finds to have committed an act of reprisal against the applicant. Any determination on this issue will not be made a part of the Board's record of proceedings and will not be given to the applicant, but will be provided directly to the Secretary of the Air Force under separate cover (Sec 865.2b, of this part).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Record of proceedings.</E> The Board staff will prepare a record of proceedings following deliberations which will include:</P>
                <P>(1) The name and vote of each Board member.</P>
                <P>(2) The application.</P>

                <P>(7) The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Board.</P>
                <P>(8) Minority reports, if any.</P>

                <P>(j) <E T="03">Minority reports.</E> A dissenting panel member may prepare a minority report which may address any aspect of the case.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Separate communications.</E> The Board may send comments or recommendations to the Secretary of the Air Force as to administrative or disciplinary action against individuals found to have committed acts of reprisal prohibited by the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act and on other <PRTPAGE P="133"/>matters arising from an application not directly related to the requested correction of military records. Such comments and recommendations will be separately communicated and will not be included in the record of proceedings or given to the applicant or counsel.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Final action by the Board.</E> The Board acts for the Secretary of the Air Force and its decision is final when it:</P>
                <P>(1) Denies any application (except under 10 U.S.C. 1034).</P>
                <P>(2) Grants any application in whole or part when the relief was recommended by the official preparing the advisory opinion, was unanimously agreed to by the panel, and does not affect an appointment or promotion requiring confirmation by the Senate, and does not affect a matter for which the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her delegee has withheld decision authority or required notification before final decision.</P>
                <P>(3) The Board sends the record of proceedings on all other applications to the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her designee for final decision.</P>
                <P>(m) The Board may identify DoD or Air Force policies, instructions, guidance or practices that are leading to, or likely to lead to unsound business decisions, unfair results, waste of government funds or public criticism. The Board will forward such observations directly to the appropriate offices of the Secretariat and/or Air Staff for review and evaluation. Such observations will not be included in the record of proceedings.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Decision of the Secretary of the Air Force.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Secretary may direct such action as he or she deems appropriate on each case, including returning the case to the Board for further consideration. Cases returned to the Board for further reconsideration will be accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons for such action. If the Secretary does not accept the Board's recommendation, the Secretary's decision will be in writing and will include a brief statement of the grounds for his/her final decision.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions in cases under the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act.</E> The Secretary will issue decisions on such cases within 180 days after receipt of the case and will, unless the full relief requested is granted, inform applicants of their right to request review of the decision by the Secretary of Defense (SecDef). Applicants will also be informed:</P>
                <P>(1) Of the name and address of the official to whom the request for review must be submitted.</P>
                <P>(2) That the request for review must be submitted within 90 days after receipt of the decision by the Secretary of the Air Force.</P>
                <P>(3) That the request for review must be in writing and include the applicant's name, address, and telephone number; a copy of the application to the AFBCMR and the final decision of the Secretary of the Air Force; and a statement of the specific reasons the applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the Secretary of the Air Force.</P>
                <P>(4) That the request must be based on the Board record; requests for review based on factual allegations or evidence not previously presented to the Board will not be considered under this paragraph but may be the basis for reconsideration by the Board under § 865.6.</P>
                <P>(c) In cases under § 865.5(b) of this part which involve additional issues not cognizable under that paragraph, the additional issues may be considered separately by the Board under § 865.3 and § 865.4 of this part. The special time limit in § 865.5 (b) does not apply to the decision concerning these additional issues.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Decisions in high profile or sensitive cases.</E> Prior to taking final action on a BCMR application that has generated, or is likely to generate, significant public or Congressional interest, the Secretarial designee will provide the case record of proceedings through Secretarial channels to OSAF so that the Secretary can determine whether to decide the case personally or take other action the Secretary deems appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reconsideration of applications.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The Board may reconsider an application if the applicant submits newly discovered relevant evidence <PRTPAGE P="134"/>that was not reasonably available when the application was previously considered. The Executive Director or Team Chiefs will screen each request for reconsideration to determine whether it contains new evidence. New arguments about, or analysis of, evidence already considered, and additional statements which are cumulative to those already in the record of proceedings will not be considered new evidence.</P>
                <P>(b) If the request contains new evidence, the Executive Director or his/her designee will refer it to a panel of the Board for a decision. The Board will decide the relevance and weight of any new evidence, whether it was reasonably available to the applicant when the application was previously considered, and whether it was submitted in a timely manner. The Board may deny reconsideration if the request does not meet the criteria for reconsideration. Otherwise the Board will reconsider the application and decide the case either on timeliness or merit as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) If the request does not contain new evidence, the Executive Director or his/her designee will return it to the applicant without referral to the Board.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Action by the Executive Director.</E> The Executive Director or his/her designee will inform the applicant or counsel, if any, of the final decision on the application. If any requested relief was denied, the Executive Director will advise the applicant of reconsideration procedures and, for cases processed under the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, review by the SecDef. The Executive Director will send decisions requiring corrective action to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, for necessary action.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Settlement of claims.</E> The Air Force is authorized, under 10 U.S.C. 1552, to pay claims for amounts due to applicants as a result of correction of military records.</P>
                <P>(1) The Executive Director will furnish the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) with AFBCMR decisions potentially affecting monetary entitlement or benefits. DFAS will treat such decisions as claims for payment by or on behalf of the applicant.</P>
                <P>(2) DFAS settles claims on the basis of the corrected military record. Computation of the amount due, if any, is a function of DFAS. Applicants may be required to furnish additional information to DFAS to establish their status as proper parties to the claim and to aid in deciding amounts due.</P>
                <P>(3) Earnings received from civilian employment during any period for which active duty pay and allowances are payable will be deducted from the settlement. Amounts found due will be offset by the amount of any existing indebtedness to the government in compliance with the Debt Collection Act of 1982 or successor statutes.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Public access to decisions.</E> After deletion of personal information, AFBCMR decisions will be made available for review and copying at an electronic public reading room.</P>

                <P>(1) All available military records pertinent to an application.</P>
                <P>(2) An advisory opinion concerning an application. The advisory opinion will include an analysis of the facts of the case and of the applicant's contentions, a statement of whether or not the requested relief can be done administratively, and a recommendation on the timeliness and merit of the request. Regardless of the recommendation, the advisory opinion will include instructions on specific corrective action to be taken if the Board grants the application.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Access to records.</E> Applicants will have access to all records considered by the Board, except those classified or privileged.

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of expenses.</E> The Air Force has no authority to pay expenses of any kind incurred by or on behalf of an applicant in connection with a correction of military records under 10 U.S.C. 1034 or 1552.</P>

                <P>The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for the overall operation of the Discharge Review program within the Department of the Air Force. The following delegation of authority have been made:</P>
                <P>(a) To the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower, Reserve Affairs and Installations) to act for the Secretary of the Air Force in all discharge review actions subject to review by the Secretary as specified in § 865.113 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) To the Director, Air Force Personnel Council, for operation of all phases of the discharge review function and authority to take action in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force in all discharge review actions except those specified in § 865.113 of this subpart.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 865.105</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Jurisdiction and authority.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The DRB has jurisdiction and authority in cases of former military personnel who, at the time of their separation from the Service, were members of the US Army Aviation components (Aviation Section, Signal Corps; Air Service; Air Corps; or Air Forces) prior to September 17, 1947, or the US Air Force. The DRB does not have jurisdiction and authority concerning personnel of other armed services who at the time of their separation, were assigned to duty with the Army Air Forces or the US Air Force.</P>
                <P>(a) The DRB's review is based on the former member's available military records, issues submitted by the former member, or his counsel and on any other evidence that is presented to the DRB. The DRB determines whether the type of discharge or dismissal the former member received is equitable and proper; if not, the DRB instructs the USAF Manpower and Personnel Center (AFMPC) to change the discharge reason or to issue a new character of discharge according to the DRB's findings.</P>
                <P>(b) The DRB is not authorized to revoke any discharge, to reinstate any person who has been separated from the military service, or to recall any person to active duty.</P>
                <P>(c) The DRB, on its own motion, may review a case that appears likely to result in a decision favorable to the former military member, without the member's knowledge or presence. In this case, if the decision is:</P>
                <P>(1) Favorable, the DRB directs AFMPC to notify the former member accordingly at the member's last known address.</P>
                <P>(2) Unfavorable, the DRB returns the case to the files without any record of formal action; the DRB then reconsiders the case without prejudice in accordance with normal procedures.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 865.106</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Application for review.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Applications shall be submitted to the Air Force DRB on DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or Dismissal from the Armed Forces of the United States (OMB Approval No. 0704-0004) with such other statements, affidavits, or documentation as desired. It is to the applicant's advantage to submit such documents with the application or within 60 days thereafter in order to permit a thorough screening of the case. The DD Form 293 is available at most DOD installations and regional offices of the Veterans Administration, or by writing to: DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Timing.</E> A motion or request for review must be made within 15 years after the date of discharge or dismissal.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicant's responsibilities.</E> An applicant may request a change in the character of or reason for discharge (or both).</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Character of discharge.</E> DD Form 293 provides an applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in character of discharge (for example, General Discharge to Honorable Discharge; Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge to General or Honorable Discharge). Only a person separated on or after 1 October 1982 while in an entry level status may request a change from other than an honorable discharge to Entry Level Separation. A request for review from an applicant who does not have an Honorable Discharge will be treated as a request for a change to an Honorable Discharge unless the applicant requests a specific change to another character of discharge.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Reason for discharge.</E> DD Form 293 provides an applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in the reason for discharge. If an applicant does not request a specific change in the reason for discharge, the DRB will presume that the request for review does not involve a request for change in the reason for discharge. Under its responsibility to examine the propriety and equity of an applicant's discharge, the DRB will change the reason for discharge if such a change is warranted.</P>

                <P>(3) The applicant must ensure that issues submitted to the DRB are consistent with the request for change in discharge set forth in “Board Action Requested” of the DD Form 293. If an ambiguity is created by a difference between an applicant's issue and the requested action, the DRB will respond <PRTPAGE P="138"/>to the issue in the context of the action requested in “Board Action Requested.” In the case of a Personal Appearance hearing, the DRB will attempt to resolve the ambiguity.</P>
                <P>(d) If the member is deceased or mentally incompetent, the spouse, next-of-kin, or legal representative may, as agent for the member, submit the application for the review along with proof of the member's death or mental incompetency.</P>
                <P>(e) Applicants forward their requests for review to the USAF Manpower and Personnel Center-mailing address: AFMPC/MPCDOA1, Randolph AFB TX 78150. AFMPC will obtain all available military records of the former members from the National Personnel Records Center.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Withdrawal of application.</E> An applicant shall be permitted to withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the scheduled review.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Submission of issues on DD Form 293.</E> Issues must be provided to the DRB on DD Form 293 before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation and should be submitted in accordance with the guidelines of this subpart for submission of issues.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Issues must be clear and specific.</E> An issue must be stated clearly and specifically in order to enable the DRB to understand the nature of the issue and its relationship to the applicant's discharge.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Separate listing of issues.</E> Each issue submitted by an applicant should be listed separately. Submission of a separate statement for each issue provides the best means of ensuring that the full import of the issue is conveyed to the DRB.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of DD Form 293.</E> DD Form 293 provides applicants with a standard format for submitting issues to the DRB, and its use:</P>
                <P>(i) Provides a means for an applicant to set forth clearly and specifically those matters that, in the opinion of the applicant, provide a basis for changing the discharge;</P>
                <P>(ii) Assists the DRB in focusing on those matters considered to be important by an applicant;</P>
                <P>(iii) Assists the DRB in distinguishing between a matter submitted by an applicant in the expectation that it will be treated as a decisional issue under § 865.112, and those matters submitted simply as background or supporting materials;</P>
                <P>(iv) Provides the applicant with greater rights in the event that the applicant later submits a complaint under § 865.121 of this subpart concerning the decisional document.</P>
                <P>(v) Reduces the potential for disagreement as to the content of an applicant's issue.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Incorporation by reference.</E> If the applicant makes an additional written submission, such as a brief, in support of the application, the applicant may incorporate by reference specific issues set forth in the written submission in accordance with the guidance on DD Form 293. The reference shall be specific enough for the DRB to identify clearly the matter being submitted as an issue. At a minimum, it shall identify the page, paragraph, and sentence incorporated. Because it is to the applicant's benefit to bring such issues to the DRB's attention as early as possible in the review, applicants who submit a brief are strongly urged to set forth all issues as a separate item at the beginning of the brief. If it reasonably appears that the applicant inadvertently has failed expressly to incorporate an issue which the applicant clearly identifies as an issue to be addressed by the DRB, the DRB shall respond to such an issue in accordance with §§ 865.111 and 865.112 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Effective date of the new DD Form 293.</E> With respect to applications received before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect at the time of submission. With respect to applications received on or after November 27, 1982, if the applicant submits an obsolete DD Form 293, the application will be returned with a copy of the revised DD Form 293 for reaccomplishment. The DRB will only respond to the issues submitted on the new form in accordance with 32 CFR part 70, 47 FR 37770, August 26, 1982 and this subpart.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Relationship of issues to character of or reason for discharge.</E> If the application applies to both character of and reason for discharge, the applicant is <PRTPAGE P="139"/>encouraged, but not required, to identify the issue as applying to the character of or reason for discharge (or both). Unless the issue is directed at the reason for discharge expressly or by necessary implication, the DRB will presume that it applies solely to the character of discharge.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Relationship of issues to the standards for discharge review.</E> The DRB reviews discharges on the basis of issues of propriety and equity. The standards used by the DRB are set forth in § 865.120 of this subpart. The applicant is encouraged to review those standards before submitting any issue upon which the applicant believes a change in discharge should be based. The applicant is also encouraged, but not required, to identify an issue as pertaining to the propriety or the equity of the discharge. This will assist the DRB in assessing the relationship of the issue to propriety or equity under § 865.112(d) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Citation of matter from decisions.</E> The primary function of the DRB involves the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis. Applicants are not required to cite prior decisions as the basis for a change in discharge. If the applicant wishes to bring the DRB's attention to a prior decision as background or illustrative material, the citation should be placed in a brief or other supporting documents. If, however, it is the applicant's intention to submit an issue that sets forth specific principles and facts from a specific cited decision, the following requirements apply with respect to applications received on or after November 27, 1982.</P>
                <P>(1) The issue must be set forth or expressly incorporated in the “Applicant's Issue” portion of DD Form 293.</P>
                <P>(2) If an applicant's issue cites a prior decision (of the DRB, another Board, an agency, or a court), the applicant shall describe the specific principles and facts that are contained in the prior decision and explain the relevance of cited matter to the applicant's case.</P>
                <P>(3) To insure timely consideration of principles cited from unpublished opinions (including decisions maintained by the Armed Forces Discharge Review Board/Correction Board Reading Room), the applicant must provide the DRB with copies of such decisions or of the relevant portion of treatise, manual, or similar source in which the principles were discussed. At the applicant's request, such materials will be returned.</P>
                <P>(4) If the applicant fails to comply with the requirements above, the decisional document shall note the defect, and shall respond to the issue without regard to the citation.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Identification by the DRB of issues submitted by an applicant.</E> The applicant's issues shall be identified in accordance with this section after a review of all materials and information is made.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Issues on DD Form 293.</E> The DRB shall consider all items submitted as issues by an applicant on DD Form 293 (or incorporated therein) in accordance with this part. With respect to applications submitted before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider all issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect at the time of the submission.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Amendment of issues.</E> The DRB shall not request or instruct an applicant to amend or withdraw any matter submitted by the applicant. Any amendment or withdrawal of an issue by an applicant shall be confirmed in writing by the applicant. This provision does not:</P>
                <P>(i) Limit by DRB's authority to question an applicant as to the meaning of such matter;</P>
                <P>(ii) Preclude the DRB from developing decisional issues based upon such questions:</P>
                <P>(iii) Prevent the applicant from amending or withdrawing such matter any time before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation; or</P>
                <P>(iv) Prevent the DRB from presenting an applicant with a list of proposed decisional issues and written information concerning the right of the applicant to add to, amend, or withdraw the applicant's submission. The written information will state that the applicant's decision to take such action (or decline to do so) will not be used against the applicant in the consideration of the case.</P>

                <P>(3) Additional Issues Identified During a Hearing. The following additional <PRTPAGE P="140"/>procedure shall be used during a hearing in order to promote the DRB's understanding of an applicant's presentation. If before closing the hearing for deliberation, the DRB believes that an applicant has presented an issue not listed on DD Form 293, the FRB may so inform the applicant, and the applicant may submit the issue in writing or add additional written issues at that time. This does not preclude the DRB from developing its own decisional issues.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Notification of possible bar to benefits.</E> Written notification shall be made to each applicant whose record indicates a reason for discharge that bars receipt of benefits under 38 U.S.C. 3103(a). This notification will advise the applicant that separate action by the Board for Correction of Military Records or the Veterans Administration may confer eligibility for VA benefits. Regarding the bar to benefits based upon the 180 days consecutive unauthorized absence, the following applies:</P>
                <P>(1) Such absence must have been included as part of the basis for the applicant's discharge under other than honorable conditions.</P>
                <P>(2) Such absence is computed without regard to the applicant's normal or adjusted expiration of term of service.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 865.107</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>DRB composition and meeting location.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The DRB consists of five members, with the senior line officer acting as the presiding officer. The presiding officer convenes, recesses and adjourns the Board.</P>
                <P>(b) In addition to holding hearings in Washington, DC, the DRB, as a convenience to applicants, periodically conducts hearings at selected locations throughout the Continental United States. Reviews are conducted at locations central to those areas with the greatest number of applicants. A continuing review and appraisal is conducted to ensure the selected hearing locations are responsive to a majority of applicants. Administrative details and responsibilities for Regional Boards are outlined in § 865.124.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 865.108</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Availability of records and documents.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Before applying for discharge review, potential applicants or their designated resentatives may, and are encouraged to obtain copies of their military personnel records by submitting a General Services Administration Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) 9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, Mo 63132; thus avoiding any lengthy delays in the processing of the application (DD Form 293) and the scheduling of reviews.</P>
                <P>(1) Once the application for discharge review (DD Form 293) is submitted, an applicant's military records are forwarded to the DRB where they cannot be reproduced. Submission of a request for an applicant's military records, including a request under the Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act after the DD Form 293 has been submitted, shall result automatically in the termporary suspension of processing of the application for discharge review until the requested records are sent to an appropriate location for copying, are copied, and returned to the headquarters of the DRB. Processing of the application shall then be resumed at whatever stage of the discharge review process is practicable.</P>
                <P>(2) Applicants and their designated representatives also may examine their military personnel records at the site of their scheduled review before the hearing. The DRB shall notify applicants and their designated representatives of the dates the records are available for examination in their standard scheduling information.</P>
                <P>(b) The DRB is not authorized to provide copies of documents that are under the cognizance of another government department, office, or activity. Applications for such information must be made by the applicant to the cognizant authority. The DRB shall advise the applicant of the mailing address of the government department, office, or activity to which the request should be submitted.</P>

                <P>(c) If the official records relevant to the discharge review are not available at the agency having custody of the <PRTPAGE P="141"/>records, the applicant shall be so notified and requested to provide such information and documents as may be desired in support of the request for discharge review. A period of not less than 30 days shall be allowed for such documents to be submitted. At the expiration of this period, the review may be conducted with information available to the DRB.</P>
                <P>(d) The DRB may take steps to obtain additional evidence that is relevant to the discharge under consideration beyond that found in the official military records or submitted by the applicant, if a review of available evidence suggests that it would be incomplete without the additional information, or when the applicant presents testimony or documents that require additional information to evaluate properly. Such information shall be made available to the applicant, upon request, with appropriate modifications regarding classified material.</P>
                <P>(1) In any case heard on the request of an applicant, the DRB shall provide the applicant and counsel or representative, if any, at a reasonable time before initiating the decision process, a notice of the availability of all regulations and documents to be considered in the discharge review, except for documents in the official personnel or medical records and any documents submitted by the applicant. The DRB shall also notify the applicant or counsel or representative (i) of the right to examine such documents or to be provided with copies of documents upon request; (ii) of the date by which such request must be received; and (iii) of the opportunity to respond within a reasonable period of time to be set be the DRB.</P>
                <P>(2) When necessary to acquaint the applicant with the substance of a classified document, the classifying authority, on the request of the DRB, shall prepare a summary of or an extract from the document, deleting all reference to source of information and other matters, the disclosure of which, in the opinion of the classifying authority, would be detrimental to the national security interest of the United States. Should preparation of such summary be deemed impracticable by the classifying authority, information from the classified source shall not be considered by the DRB in its review of the case.</P>

                <P>(e) Current Air Force numbered publications may be obtained from the Chief, Central Base Administration at any major Air Force installation or by writing:

                <P>(a) The applicant is entitled, by law, to appear in person at his or her request before the DRB in open session and to be represented by counsel of his or her own selection. The applicant also may present such witnesses as he or she may desire.</P>
                <P>(b) There are two types of reviews. They are:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Record Review.</E> A review of the application, available service records, and additional documents (if any) submitted by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> A personal appearance before the DRB by the applicant with or without counsel, or by the counsel only.</P>
                <P>(c) The Government does not compensate or pay the expenses of the applicant, applicant's witnesses, or counsel.</P>
                <P>(d) A summary of the available military records of the applicant is prepared for use by the DRB in the review process. A copy of the summary is available to the applicant and/or his or her counsel, upon request.</P>
                <P>(e) When an applicant has requested a personal appearance and/or representation by counsel on the DD Form 293, the DRB sends written notice of the hearing time and place to the applicant and designated counsel. Evidence of such notification will be placed in the applicant's record.</P>

                <P>(f) Personal appearance hearings shall be conducted with recognition of the rights of the individual to privacy. Accordingly, presence at hearings of individuals other than those whose presence is required will be limited to persons authorized by the presiding officer and/or expressly requested by the <PRTPAGE P="142"/>applicant, subject to reasonable limitations based upon available space.</P>
                <P>(g) Formal rules of evidence shall not be applied in DRB proceedings. The presiding officer shall rule on matters of procedure and shall ensure that reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality are maintained in the taking of evidence and presentation of witnesses. Applicants and witnesses may present evidence to the DRB panel either in person or by affidavit or through counsel. If an applicant or witness testifies under oath or affirmation, he or she is subject to questioning by Board members.</P>
                <P>(h) There is a presumption of regularity in the conduct of governmental affairs. This presumption can be applied in any review unless there is substantial credible evidence to rebut the presumption.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Failure to appear at a hearing or respond to scheduling notice.</E> (1) Except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force, further opportunity for a personal appearance hearing shall not be made available in the following circumstances to an applicant who has requested a hearing.</P>
                <P>(i) When the applicant and/or a designated counsel or representative has been sent a letter containing the date and location of a proposed hearing and fails to make a timely response; or</P>
                <P>(ii) When the applicant and/or a designated representative, after being notified by letter of the time and place of the hearing, fails to appear at the appointed time, either in person or by representative, without having made a prior, timely request for a postponement or withdrawal.</P>
                <P>(2) In such cases, the applicant shall be deemed to have waived his/her right to a hearing, and the DRB shall complete its review of the discharge. Further request for a hearing shall not be granted unless the applicant can demonstrate that the failure to appear or respond was due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Continuance and postponements.</E> (1) A continuance of a discharge review hearing may be authorized by the presiding officer of the Board concerned, provided that such continuance is of a reasonable duration and is essential to achieving a full and fair hearing. Where a proposal for continuance is indefinite, the pending application shall be returned to the applicant with the option to resubmit when the case is fully ready for review.</P>
                <P>(2) Postponements of scheduled reviews normally shall not be permitted other than for demonstrated good and sufficient reason set forth by the applicant in a timely manner, or for the convenience of the government.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Reconsideration.</E> A discharge review shall not be subject to reconsideration except:</P>
                <P>(1) Where the only previous consideration of the case was on the motion of the DRB;</P>
                <P>(2) When the original discharge review did not involve a personal appearance hearing and a personal appearance is now desired, and the provisions of § 865.109(j) do not apply;</P>
                <P>(3) Where changes in discharge policy are announced subsequent to an earlier review of an applicant's discharge, and the new policy is made expressly retroactive;</P>
                <P>(4) Where the DRB determines that policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration, provided that such changes in policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded an applicant in such proceeding;</P>
                <P>(5) Where an individual is to be represented by a counsel/representative, and was not so represented in any previous consideration of the case.</P>
                <P>(6) Where the case was not previously considered under the uniform standards published pursuant to Pub. L. 95-126 and application is made for such consideration within 15 years after the date of discharge; or</P>

                <P>(7) On the basis of presentation of new, substantial, relevant evidence not available to the applicant at the time of the original review. The decision as to whether evidence offered by an applicant in support of a request for reconsideration is in fact new, substantial, relevant, and was not available to the applicant at the time of the original review will be based on a comparison of such evidence with the evidence <PRTPAGE P="143"/>considered in the previous discharge review. If this comparison shows that the evidence submitted would have had a probable effect on matters concerning the propriety or equity of the discharge, the request for reconsideration shall be granted.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Decision process.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The DRB shall meet in plenary session to review discharges and exercise its discretion on a case-by-case basis in applying the standards set forth in this regulation.</P>
                <P>(b) The presiding officer is responsible for the conduct of the discharge review. The presiding officer shall convene, recess, and adjourn the DRB as appropriate, and shall maintain an atmosphere of dignity and decorum at all times.</P>
                <P>(c) Each board member shall act under oath or affirmation requiring careful, objective consideration of the application. They shall consider all relevant material and competent information presented to them by the applicant. In addition, they shall consider all available military records, together with such other records as may be in the files and relevant to the issues before the DRB.</P>
                <P>(d) The DRB shall identify and address issues after a review of the following material obtained and presented in accordance with this subpart and 32 CFR part 70: available official military records, documentary evidence submitted by or on behalf of the applicant, presentation of testimony by or on behalf of the applicant, oral or written arguments presented by or on behalf of the applicant, and any other relevant evidence.</P>
                <P>(e) Application of Standards:</P>
                <P>(1) When the DRB determines that an applicant's discharge was improper, the DRB will determine which reason for discharge should have been assigned based upon the facts and circumstances properly before the discharge authority in view of the regulations governing reasons for discharge at the time the applicant was discharged.</P>
                <P>(2) When the board determines that an applicant's discharge was inequitable, any change will be based on the evaluation of the applicant's overall record of service and relevant regulations.</P>
                <P>(f) Voting shall be conducted in closed session, a majority of the five members' votes constituting the DRB's decision.</P>
                <P>(g) Details of closed session deliberations of a DRB are privileged information and shall not be divulged.</P>
                <P>(h) A formal minority opinion may be submitted in instances of disagreement between members of a board. The opinion must cite findings, conclusions and reasons which are the basis for the opinion. The complete case with the majority and minority recommendations will be submitted to the Director, Air Force Personnel Council.</P>
                <P>(i) The DRB may request advisory opinions from staff offices of the Air Force. These opinions are advisory in nature and are not binding on the DRB in its decision making process.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 865.111</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Response to items submitted as issues by the applicant.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If an issue submitted by an applicant contains two or more clearly separate issues, the DRB should respond to each issue under the guidance of this section as if it had been set forth separately by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(b) If an applicant uses a “building block” approach (that is, setting forth a series of conclusions on issues that lead to a single conclusion purportedly warranting a change in the applicant's discharge), normally there should be a separate response to each issue.</P>
                <P>(c) This section does not preclude the DRB from making a single response to multiple issues when such action would enhance the clarity of the decisional document, but such response must reflect an adequate response to each separate issue.</P>
                <P>(d) An item submitted as an issue by an applicant in accordance with this regulation shall be addressed as a decisional issue under § 865.112 of this subpart in the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) When the DRB decides that a change in discharge should be granted, and the DRB bases its decision in whole or in part on the applicant's issue; or</P>

                <P>(2) When the DRB does not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, and the decision is <PRTPAGE P="144"/>based in whole or in part on the DRB's disagreement with the merits of an issue submitted by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(e) If the applicant receives the full change in discharge requested (or a more favorable change), that fact shall be noted and the basis shall be addressed as a decisional issue even if that basis is not addressed as an issue by the applicant. No further response is required to other issues submitted by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(f) If the applicant does not receive the full change in discharge requested with respect to either the character of or reason for discharge (or both), the DRB shall address the items submitted by the applicant unless one of the following responses is applicable:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Duplicate issues.</E> The DRB may state that there is a full response to the issue submitted by the applicant under a specified decisional issue. This respose may be used only when one issue clearly duplicates another or the issue clearly requires discussion in conjunction with another issue.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Citations without principles and facts.</E> The DRB may state that any issue, which consists of a citation of a previous decision without setting forth any principles and facts from the decision that the applicant states are relevant to the applicant's case, does not comply with the requirements of § 865.106(g)(1) of this part.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Unclear issues.</E> The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because the meaning of the item is unclear. An issue is unclear if it cannot be understood by a reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the materials considered under § 865.110(d) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonspecific issues.</E> The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because it is not specific. A submission is considered not specific if a reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the materials considered under § 865.110(d), cannot determine the relationship between the applicant's submission and the particular circumstances of the case. This response may be used only if the submission is expressed in such general terms that no other response is applicable. For example, if the DRB disagrees with the applicant as to the relevance of matters set forth in the submission, the DRB normally will set forth the nature of the disagreement under the guidance in § 865.112 of this subpart with respect to decisional issues, or it will reject the applicant's position on the basis of § 865.111(f)(1) or § 865.111(f)(2). If the applicant's submission is so general that none of those provisions is applicable, then the DRB may state that it cannot respond because the item is not specific.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Decisional issues.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The decisional document shall discuss the issues that provide a basis for the decision whether there should be a change in the character of or reason for discharge. In order to enhance clarity, the DRB should not address matters other than issues relied upon in the decision or raised by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Partial Change.</E> When the decision changes a discharge but does not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, the decisional document shall address both the issues upon which change is granted and the issues upon which the DRB denies the full change requested.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Relationship of Issue to Character of or Reason for Discharge.</E> Generally, the decisional document should specify whether a decisional issue applies to the character of or reason for discharge (or both), but it is not required to do so.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Relationship of an Issue to Propriety or Equity.</E> (1) If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to both propriety and equity, the DRB will consider it under both standards.</P>
                <P>(2) If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to the propriety of the discharge (for example, by citing a propriety standard or otherwise claiming that a change in discharge is required as a matter of law), the DRB shall consider the issue solely as a matter of propriety. Except as provided in § 865.112(d)(4), the DRB is not required to consider such an issue under the equity standards.</P>

                <P>(3) If the applicant's issue contends that the DRB is required as a matter of <PRTPAGE P="145"/>law to follow a prior decision by setting forth an issue of propriety from the prior decision and decribing its relationship to the applicant's case, the issue shall be considered under the propriety standards and addressed under § 865.112(e) or § 865.112(f).</P>
                <P>(4) If the applicant's issue sets forth principles of equity contained in a prior DRB decision, describes the relationship to the applicant's case, and contends that the DRB is required as a matter of law to follow the prior case, the decisional document shall note that the DRB is not bound by its discretionary decisions in prior cases under the standards in § 865.120 of this subpart. However, the principles cited by the applicant, and the description of the relationship of the principles to the applicant's case, shall be considered under the equity standards and addressed under § 865.112(h) or § 865.112(i).</P>
                <P>(5) If the applicant's issue cannot be identified as a matter of propriety or equity, the DRB shall address it as an issue of equity.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Change of discharge: Issues of propriety.</E> If a change in the discharge is warranted under the propriety standards the decisional document shall state that conclusion and list the errors or expressly retroactive changes in policy that provide a basis for the conclusion. The decisional document shall cite the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the error or change in policy to the applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not granting the full change shall be addressed.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Denial of the full change requested: Issues of propriety.</E> If the decision rejects the applicant's position on an issue of propriety, or if it is otherwise decided on the basis of an issue of propriety that the full change in discharge requested by the applicant is not warranted, the decisional document shall note that conclusion. The decisional document shall list reasons for its conclusion on each issue of propriety under the following guidance:</P>
                <P>(1) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a part, statute, constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other source of law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of law and the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the source of law to the particular circumstances in the case.</P>
                <P>(2) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, including a factor required by applicable Air Force regulations to be considered for determination of the character of and reason for the applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each such event or circumstance.</P>
                <P>(i) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a citation is not required.</P>
                <P>(ii) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional document shall set forth the conflicting evidence, and explain why the information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for rejecting such information, the decisional document shall explain why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.</P>
                <P>(3) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an issue of propriety, the following guidance applies in addition to the guidance in § 842.112(f) (1) and (2).</P>

                <P>(i) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant).<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the applicant's case.</P>
                <P>(iii) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by stating that the applicant's issue of propriety is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change in discharge, and by providing an explanation for this position. When the applicant indicates that the issue is to be considered in conjunction with one or more other specified issues, the explanation will address all such specified issues.</P>
                <P>(iv) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.</P>
                <P>(v) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge must be changed because of an alleged error in a record associated with the discharge, and the record has not been corrected by the organization with primary responsibility for corrective action, respond that it will presume the validity of the record in the absence of such corrective action. If the organization empowered to correct the record is within the Department of the Air Force, the DRB should provide the applicant with a brief description of the procedures for requesting correction of the record. If the DRB on its own motion cites this issue as a decisional issue on the basis of equity, it shall address the issue as such.</P>
                <P>(vi) When an applicant's issue contains a general allegation that a certain course of action violated his or her constitutional rights, respond in appropriate cases by noting that the action was consistent with statutory or regulatory authority, and by citing the presumption of constitutionality that attaches to statutes and regulations. If, on the other hand, the applicant makes a specific challenge to the constitutionality of the action by challenging the application of a statute or regulation is a particular set of circumstances, it is not sufficient to respond solely by citing the presumption of constitutionality of the statute or regulation when the applicant is not challenging the constitutionality of the statute or regulation. Instead, the response must address the specific circumstances of the case.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Denial of the full change in discharge requested when propriety is not at issue.</E> If the applicant has not submitted an issue of propriety and the DRB has not otherwise relied upon an issue of propriety to change the discharge, the decisional document shall contain a statement to that effect. The DRB is not required to provide any further discussion as to the propriety of the discharge.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Change of discharge: Issues of equity.</E> If the DRB concludes that a change in the discharge is warranted under equity standards the decisional document shall list each issue of equity upon which this conclusion is based. The DRB shall cite the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the issue to the applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not giving the full change requested shall be discussed.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Denial of the full change requested: Issues of equity.</E> If the DRB rejects the applicant's position on an issue of equity, or if the decision otherwise provides less than the full change in discharge requested by the applicant, the decisional document shall note that conclusion. The DRB shall list reasons for its conclusions on each issue of equity in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(1) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a part, statute, constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other source of law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of law and the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the source of law to the exercise of discretion on the issue of equity in the applicant's case.</P>

                <P>(2) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, including a factor required by applicable Air Force regulations to be considered for determination of the character of and reason for the applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each such event or circumstance.<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a citation is not required.</P>
                <P>(ii) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional document shall set forth the conflicting evidence, and explain why the information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for rejecting such information, the decisional document shall explain why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.</P>
                <P>(3) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an issue of equity, the following guidance applies in addition to the guidance in § 865.112(i) (1) and (2):</P>
                <P>(i) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant).</P>
                <P>(ii) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the applicant's case.</P>
                <P>(iii) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by explaining why the applicant's issue is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change in discharge as a matter of equity. When the applicant indicates that the issue is to be considered in conjunction with other specified issues, the explanation will address all such issues.</P>
                <P>(iv) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.</P>
                <P>(v) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge should be changed as a matter of equity because of an alleged error in a record associated with the discharge, and the record has not been corrected by the organization with primary responsibility for corrective action, the DRB may respond that it will presume the validity of the record in the absence of such corrective action. However, the DRB will consider whether it should exercise its equitable powers to change the discharge on the basis of the alleged error. If it declines to do so, the DRB shall explain why the applicant's position did not provide a sufficient basis for the change in the discharge requested by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(4) When the DRB concludes that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors, the DRB must set forth reasons such as the seriousness of the offense, specific circumstances surrounding the offense, number of offenses, lack of mitigating circumstances, or similar factors. The DRB is not required, however, to explain why it relied on any such factors unless the applicability or weight of such factors are expressly raised as an issue by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(5) If the applicant has not submitted any issues and the DRB has not otherwise relied upon an issue of equity for a change in discharge, the decisional document shall contain a statement to that effect, and shall note that the major factors upon which the discharge was based are set forth in the service record portion of the decisional document.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Recommendations by the Director of the Personnel Council and Secretarial Review Authority.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Director of the Personnel Council may forward cases for consideration by the Secretarial Reviewing Authority (SRA) under rules established by the Secretary of the Air Force.</P>

                <P>(b) The following categories of dicharge review requests are subject to <PRTPAGE P="148"/>the review of the Secretary of the Air Force or the Secretary's designee.</P>
                <P>(1) Cases in which a minority of the DRB panel requests their submitted opinions be forwarded for consideration (refer to § 865.110(h)).</P>
                <P>(2) Cases when required in order to provide information to the Secretary on specific aspects of the discharge review function which are of interest to the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(3) Any case which the Director, Air Force Personnel Council believes is of significant interest to the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(c) The Secretarial Reviewing Authority is the Secretary of the Air Force or the official to whom he has delegated this authority. The SRA may review the types of cases described above before issuance of the final notification of a decision. Those cases forwarded for review by the SRA shall be considered under the standards set forth in § 865.121 and DOD Directive 1332.28.</P>
                <P>(d) There is no requirement that the Director of the Personnel Council submit a recommendation when a case is forwarded to the SRA. If a recommendation is submitted, however, it should be in accordance with the guidelines described below.</P>
                <P>(e) Format for Recommendation. If a recommendation is provided, it shall contain the Director's views whether there should be a change in the character of or reason for discharge (or both). If the Director recommends such a change, the particular change to be made shall be specified. The recommendation shall set forth the Director's position on decisional issues submitted by the applicant in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Adoption of the DRB's Decisional document. The recommendation may state that the Director has adopted the decisional document prepared by the majority. The Director shall ensure that the decisional document meets the requirements of this regulation.</P>
                <P>(2) Adoption of the Specific Statements From the Majority.

                <P>(i) A list of the issues on which the SRA's decision is based. Each such decisional issue shall be addressed by the SRA. This includes reasons for rejecting the conclusion of the DRB or the Director with respect to decisional issues which, if resolved in the applicant's favor, would have resulted in change to the discharge more favorable to the applicant than that afforded by the SRA's decision.</P>
                <P>(ii) The SRA's response to items submitted as issues by the applicant will be in accordance with § 865.111 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Response to Rebuttal.</E> (i) If the SRA grants the full change in discharge requested by the applicant (or a more favorable change), that fact shall be noted, the decisional document shall be addressed accordingly, and no further response to the rebuttal is required.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the SRA does not grant the full change in discharge requested by the applicant (or a more favorable change), the addendum shall list each issue in rebuttal submitted by an applicant and shall set forth the response of the SRA under the following:</P>
                <P>(A) If the SRA rejects an issue in rebuttal, the SRA may respond in accordance with the principles in § 865.112 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(B) If the matter adopted by the SRA provides a basis for the SRA's rejection of the rebuttal material, the SRA may note that fact and cite the specific matter adopted that responds to the issue in rebuttal.</P>
                <P>(C) If the matter submitted by the applicant does not meet the requirements for rebuttal material in paragraph (g) of this section, that fact shall be noted.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Discharge review standards.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Objective of review.</E> The objective of a discharge review is to examine the propriety and equity of the applicant's discharge and to effect changes, if necessary. The standards of review and the underlying factors which aid in determining whether the standards are met shall be historically consistent with criteria for determining honorable service. No factors shall be established which require automatic change or denial of a change in a discharge. Neither the DRB nor the Secretary of the Air Force shall be bound by any methodology of weighing of the factors in reaching a determination. In each case, the DRB or Secretary of the Air Force shall give full, fair, and impartial consideration to all applicable factors prior to reaching a decision. An applicant may not receive a less favorable discharge than that issued at the time of separation. This does not preclude correction of clerical errors.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Propriety.</E> A discharge shall be deemed to be proper unless in the course of discharge review, it is determined that:</P>
                <P>(1) There exists an error of fact, law, procedures, or discretion associated with the discharge at the time of issuance; and that the rights of the applicant were prejudiced thereby (such error shall constitute prejudicial error, if there is substantial doubt that the discharge would have remained the same if the error had not been made); or</P>
                <P>(2) A change in policy by the Air Force made expressly retroactive to the type of discharge under consideration, requires a change in the discharge.</P>
                <P>(c) When a record associated with the discharge at the time of issuance involves a matter in which the primary responsibility for corrective action rests with another organization (for example, another Board, agency, or court), the DRB will recognize an error only to the extent that the error has been corrected by the organization with primary responsibility for correcting the record.</P>
                <P>(d) The primary function of the DRB is to exercise its discretion on issues of equity by reviewing the individual merits of each application on a case-by-case basis. Prior decisions in which the DRB exercised its discretion to change a discharge based on issues of equity (including the factors cited in such decisions or the weight given to factors in such decisions) do not blind the DRB in its review of subsequent cases because no two cases present the same issues of equity.</P>

                <P>(e) The following applies to applicants who received less than fully honorable administrative discharges because of their civilian misconduct while in an inactive reserve component and who were discharged or had their discharge reviewed on or after April 20, 1971: the DRB shall either recharacterize the discharge to honorable without any additional proceedings or additional proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Court's Order of December 3, 1981, in Wood v. Secretary of Defense to determine whether proper grounds exist for the issuance of a less <PRTPAGE P="153"/>than honorable discharge, taking into account that:</P>
                <P>(1) An Under Other Than Honorable (formerly Undesirable) Discharge for an inactive reservist can only be based upon civilian misconduct found to have affected directly the performance of military duties;</P>
                <P>(2) A General Discharge for an inactive reservist can only be based upon civilian misconduct found to have had an adverse impact on the overall effectiveness of the military, including military morale and efficiency.</P>
                <P>(f) The following applies to applicants who received less than fully honorable administrative discharges (between June 21, 1971 and March 2, 1982) because evidence developed by or as a direct result of complusory urinalysis testing was introduced in the discharge proceedings. Applicants who believe they are members of the above category will so indicate this by writing “CATEGORY W” in block 7 of their DD Form 293. AFMPC/MPCDOA1 will expedite processing these applications to the designated “CATEGORY W” reviewer. For class members the designated reviewer shall either recharacterize the discharge to honorable without any additional proceedings or complete a review to determine whether proper ground exists for the issuance of a less than honorable discharge. If the applicant is determined not to be a class member, the application is returned to normal review procedure channels. If new administrative proceedings are initiated, the former service member must be notified of:</P>
                <P>(1) The basis of separation other than drug abuse or use or possession of drugs based upon compelled urinalysis that was specified in the commander's report and upon which the Air Force now seeks to base a less than honorable discharge.</P>
                <P>(2) The full complement of procedural protections that are required by current regulations.</P>
                <P>(3) Name, address and telephone number of an Area Defense Counsel with whom the former service member has a right to consult, and</P>
                <P>(4) The right to participate in the new proceedings to be conducted at the Air Force base nearest the former service member's current address, or to elect to maintain his or her present character of discharge.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Equity.</E> A discharge shall be deemed to be equitable unless:</P>
                <P>(1) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that the policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) Current policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded an applicant in such proceedings; and</P>
                <P>(ii) There is substantial doubt that the applicant would have received the same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures had been available to the applicant at the time of the discharge proceedings under consideration.</P>
                <P>(2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with standards of discipline in the Air Force; or</P>
                <P>(3) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that a change is warranted based upon consideration of the applicant's military record and other evidence presented to the DRB viewed in conjunction with the factors listed in this section and the regulations under which the applicant was discharged, even though the discharge was determined to have been otherwise equitable and proper at the time of issuance. Areas of consideration include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Quality of Service, as evidenced by factors such as:</P>
                <P>(A) Service History, including date of enlistment, period of enlistment, highest rank achieved, conduct or efficiency ratings (numerical or narrative).</P>
                <P>(B) Awards and decorations.</P>
                <P>(C) Letters of commendation or reprimand.</P>
                <P>(D) Combat service.</P>
                <P>(E) Wounds received in action.</P>
                <P>(F) Record of promotions and demotions.</P>
                <P>(G) Level of responsibility at which the applicant served.</P>

                <P>(H) Other acts of merit that may not have resulted in a formal recognition through an award or commendation.<PRTPAGE P="154"/>
                </P>
                <P>(I) Length of service during the period which is the subject of the discharge review.</P>
                <P>(J) Prior military service and type of discharge received or outstanding post-service conduct to the extent that such matters provide a basis for a more thorough understanding of the performance of the applicant during the period of service which is the subject of the discharge review.</P>
                <P>(K) Convictions by court-martial.</P>
                <P>(L) Record of non-judicial punishment.</P>
                <P>(M) Convictions by civil authorities while a member of the Air Force, reflected in the discharge proceedings or otherwise noted in military records.</P>
                <P>(N) Record of periods of unauthorized absence.</P>
                <P>(O) Records relating to a discharge in lieu of court-martial.</P>
                <P>(ii) Capability to Serve, as evidenced by factors such as:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Issuing CILs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The issuing authority makes sure that the proper CIL form is issued, particularly if the service member has had service in both the Army and Air Force. The assignment status as of September 26, 1947 determines if the person was in the Army or Air Force at the time of discharge or release from active duty. Separations that took place on or before September 25, 1947 are considered Army separations. Those that took place on or after September 26, 1947 are considered Air Force separations, unless the records clearly show the person actually served as a member of the Army during the period of service for which the CIL is requested. Individuals indicated in § 887.3 may be issued CILs prepared on one of the following forms:</P>
              <P>(a) DD Form 303AF, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Discharge, is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of discharge from the Air Force.</P>
              <P>(b) DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement, is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of retirement from the Air Force (issued only to service members).</P>
              <P>(c) AF Form 386, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Discharge (AUS), is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of discharge from the Army.</P>
              <P>(d) AF Form 681, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Certificate of Service (AUS), is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of service, or like form, issued on release from extended active duty (EAD) in the Army.</P>
              <P>(e) AF Form 682, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Certificate of Service (USAF), is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of service, or like form, issued on release from EAD in the Air Force.</P>

                <P>The Air Force Academy conducts a precandidate evaluation program as an initial step in the admissions process and as an aid to Members of Congress in screening their applicants for nomination.</P>
                <P>(a) Applicants normally are sent a precandidate packet, including USAFA Form 149, Precandidate Questionnaire, with a request for the applicant to provide academic, athletic, leadership, and medical information.</P>
                <P>(b) The Academy evaluates the precandidate information and provides an analysis to appropriate congressional offices. Such information gives the nominating authorities an indication of the applicant's potential to qualify for admission and the applicant's self-reported medical status; it does not, however, reflect the applicant's final admission status. It is intended only to aid in selecting the best-qualified applicants for nomination.</P>
                <P>(c) Applicants whose evaluation indicates they are fully qualified will be notified and advised to seek a nomination. Individuals whose evaluations reflect areas needing improvement are informed and encouraged to submit additional test scores or information in an effort to meet the qualifying levels.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Charging of appointees.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Appointment of candidates is according to § 901.18. Selecting of the charged cadets from the nominees for each vacancy is accomplished as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Principal nominee, numbered-alternate method.</E> Principal, if meeting the admission criteria, is appointed and charged. Otherwise the 1st alternate, if meeting the admission criteria, is appointed and charged or the next succeeding numbered alternate who meets the admission criteria is appointed and charged. In instances where a candidate received two principal nominations from two Congressional sources, the principal normally is charged to the Member of Congress submitting the principal nomination first.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Principal nominee, competitive-alternate method.</E> Principal, if meeting the admission criteria, is appointed and charged. All alternates are ranked according to merit. If the principal does not meet admission criteria, the highest ranking alternate is appointed and charged.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Competitive nominee method.</E> The group of competitive nominees are evaluated, ranked according to merit, and the highest-ranked nominee, if meeting the admission criteria, is appointed and charged.<PRTPAGE P="170"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Multiple Congressional nominations.</E> For candidates receiving numerous nominations, normally the candidate is charged to the congressional source. If the candidate is nominated by several congressional sources, the candidate normally is charged to the slate of the congressional member where the candidate ranks the highest, unless the candidate is the principal nominee or a numbered alternate.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Other sources of nomination.</E> All other candidates not nominated by congressional, Vice-Presidential, or U.S. Possessions who are appointed are charged to that nominating source (Presidential, AFJROTC, AFROTC, CODDV, Medal of Honor, etc.).</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Qualified alternates.</E> To bring the Cadet Wing up to strength, the qualified alternate appointed according to § 901.19 is charged to the Secretary of the Air Force as a qualified alternate. Those candidates having congressional, Vice-Presidential, or U.S. Possessions nominations appear as a qualified alternate for that nominating source.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Multiple congressional and other sources of nominations.</E> For appointees who have multiple nominations, USAFA/RRS determines the appointment category to which they are assigned. Normally a cadet with both congressional and non-congressional nominations is assigned to a congressional authority. Designation of “charged” cadets (those filling a Vice-Presidential, congressional, or U.S. Possessions quota) also is accomplished by USAFA/RRS according to § 901.18. USAFA/RRS notifies HQ USAF/DPPA of these assignments which are audited and verified by HQ USAF/DPPA. The Vice Presidential and nominating authorities in Congress and U.S. Possessions are notified of their charged appointees and other nominees who win appointments by HQ USAF/DPPA.</P>

                <P>(c) When both sides are ready for arraignment, or when the Court determines that both sides have had adequate opportunities to prepare for arraignment, the Court shall read the charges to the accused, explain them (if necessary), and, after the reading or stating of each charge in Court, ask the accused whether he pleads “guilty” or “not guilty”. The Court shall enter in the record of the case the plea made to each charge.</P>
                <P>(d) The accused may plead “guilty” to any or all of the charges against him, except that the Court may in its discretion refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and may not accept a plea without first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge.</P>
                <P>(e) The accused may plead “not guilty” to any or all of the charges against him. The Court shall enter a plea of not guilty if the answer of the accused to any charge is such that it does not clearly amount to a plea of guilty or not guilty.</P>
                <P>(f) The accused may, at any stage of the trial, with the consent of the Court, change a plea of not guilty to one of guilty. The Court shall then proceed as if the accused had originally pleaded guilty.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part implements the Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) and provides procedures for environmental impact analysis both within the United States and abroad. Because the authority for, and rules governing, each aspect of the EIAP differ depending on whether the action takes place in the United States or outside the United States, this part provides largely separate procedures for each type of action. Consequently, the main body of this part deals primarily with environmental impact analysis under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (Public Law 91-190, 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 4321 through 4347), while the primary procedures for environmental impact analysis of actions outside the United States in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, are contained in §§ 989.37 and 989.38.</P>
              <P>(b) The procedures in this part are essential to achieve and maintain compliance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508, referred to as the “CEQ Regulations”). Further requirements are contained in Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 4715.1, Environmental Security, Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4715.9, Environmental Planning and Analysis, DoDD 5000.1, Defense Acquisition, and Department of Defense Regulation 5000.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and Major Automated Information System Acquisition Programs. <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> To comply with NEPA and complete the EIAP, the CEQ Regulations and this part must be used together.</P>

              </FTNT>

              <P>(c) Air Force activities abroad will comply with this part, E. O. 12114, and 32 CFR part 187 (DoDD 6050.7, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions, March 31, <PRTPAGE P="193"/>1979). To comply with E.O. 12114 and complete the EIAP, the Executive Order, 32 CFR part 187, and this part must be used together.</P>

              <P>Air Force personnel will:</P>
              <P>(a) Consider and document environmental effects of proposed Air Force actions through AF Forms 813, EAs, FONSIs, EISs, RODs, and documents prepared according to E.O. 12114.</P>
              <P>(b) Evaluate proposed actions for possible CATEX from environmental impact analysis (appendix B).</P>
              <P>(c) Make environmental documents, comments, and responses, including those of other federal agencies, state, Tribal, and local governments, and the public, part of the record available for review and use at all levels of decisionmaking.</P>
              <P>(d) Review the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIAP when evaluating the proposal prior to decisionmaking.</P>
              <P>(e) Ensure that alternatives to be considered by the decisionmaker are both reasonable and within the range of alternatives analyzed in the environmental documents.</P>
              <P>(f) Pursue the objective of furthering foreign policy and national security interests while at the same time considering important environmental factors.</P>
              <P>(g) Consider the environmental effects of actions that affect the global commons.</P>

              <P>(h) Determine whether any foreign government should be informed of the <PRTPAGE P="197"/>availability of environmental documents. Formal arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters and communications with foreign governments concerning environmental agreements will be coordinated with the Department of State by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations (SAF/IEI) through the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations &amp; Environment). This coordination requirement does not apply to informal working-level communications and arrangements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Organizational relationships.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The host EPF manages the EIAP using an interdisciplinary team approach. This is especially important for tenant-proposed actions, because the host command is responsible for the EIAP for actions related to the host command's installations.</P>
              <P>(b) The host command prepares environmental documents internally or directs the host base to prepare the environmental documents. Environmental document preparation may be by contract (requiring the tenant to fund the EIAP), by the tenant unit, or by the host. Regardless of the preparation method, the host command will ensure the required environmental analysis is accomplished before a decision is made on the proposal and an action is undertaken. Support agreements should provide specific procedures to ensure host oversight of tenant compliance, tenant funding or reimbursement of host EIAP costs, and tenant compliance with the EIAP regardless of the tenant not being an Air Force organization.</P>
              <P>(c) For aircraft beddown and unit realignment actions, program elements are identified in the Program Objective Memorandum. Subsequent Program Change Requests must include AF Form 813.</P>
              <P>(d) To ensure timely initiation of the EIAP, SAF/AQ forwards information copies of all Mission Need Statements and System Operational Requirements Documents to SAF/IEI, HQ USAF/A7CI (or NGB/A7CV), the Air Force Medical Operations Agency, Aerospace Medicine Office (AFMOA/SG), and the affected MAJCOM EPFs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests from Non-Air Force agencies or entities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Non-Air Force agencies or entities may request the Air Force to undertake an action, such as issuing a permit or outleasing Air Force property, that may primarily benefit the requester or an agency other than the Air Force. The EPF and other Air Force staff elements must identify such requests and coordinate with the proponent of the non-Air Force proposal, as well as with concerned state, Tribal, and local governments.</P>
              <P>(b) Air Force decisions on such proposals must take into consideration the potential environmental impacts of the applicant's proposed activity (as described in an Air Force environmental document), insofar as the proposed action involves Air Force property or programs, or requires Air Force approval.</P>

              <P>(c) The Air Force may require the requester to prepare, at the requester's expense, an analysis of environmental impacts (40 CFR 1506.5), or the requester may be required to pay for an EA or EIS to be prepared by a contractor selected and supervised by the Air Force. The EPF may permit requesters to submit draft EAs for their proposed actions, except for actions described in § 989.16(a) and (b), or for actions the EPF has reason to believe will ultimately require an EIS. For EISs, the EPF has the responsibility to prepare the environmental document, <PRTPAGE P="198"/>although responsibility for funding remains with the requester. The fact that the requester has prepared environmental documents at its own expense does not commit the Air Force to allow or undertake the proposed action or its alternatives. The requester is not entitled to any preference over other potential parties with whom the Air Force might contract or make similar arrangements.</P>
              <P>(d) In no event is the requester who prepares or funds an environmental analysis entitled to reimbursement from the Air Force. When requesters prepare environmental documents outside the Air Force, the Air Force must independently evaluate and approve the scope and content of the environmental analyses before using the analyses to fulfill EIAP requirements. Any outside environmental analysis must evaluate reasonable alternatives as defined in § 989.8.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Analysis of alternatives.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Air Force must analyze reasonable alternatives to the proposed action and the “no action” alternative in all EAs and EISs, as fully as the proposed action alternative.</P>
              <P>(b) “Reasonable” alternatives are those that meet the underlying purpose and need for the proposed action and that would cause a reasonable person to inquire further before choosing a particular course of action. Reasonable alternatives are not limited to those directly within the power of the Air Force to implement. They may involve another government agency or military service to assist in the project or even to become the lead agency. The Air Force must also consider reasonable alternatives raised during the scoping process (see § 989.18) or suggested by others, as well as combinations of alternatives. The Air Force need not analyze highly speculative alternatives, such as those requiring a major, unlikely change in law or governmental policy. If the Air Force identifies a large number of reasonable alternatives, it may limit alternatives selected for detailed environmental analysis to a reasonable range or to a reasonable number of examples covering the full spectrum of alternatives.</P>
              <P>(c) The Air Force may expressly eliminate alternatives from detailed analysis, based on reasonable selection standards (for example, operational, technical, or environmental standards suitable to a particular project). In consultation with the EPF, the appropriate Air Force organization may develop written selection standards to firmly establish what is a “reasonable” alternative for a particular project, but they must not so narrowly define these standards that they unnecessarily limit consideration to the proposal initially favored by proponents. This discussion of reasonable alternatives applies equally to EAs and EISs.</P>
              <P>(d) Except in those rare instances where excused by law, the Air Force must always consider and assess the environmental impacts of the “no action” alternative. “No action” may mean either that current management practice will not change or that the proposed action will not take place. If no action would result in other predictable actions, those actions should be discussed within the no action alternative section. The discussion of the no action alternative and the other alternatives should be comparable in detail to that of the proposed action.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Lead and cooperating agency (40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6).</E> When the Air Force is a cooperating agency in the preparation of an EIS, the Air Force reviews and approves principal environmental documents within the EIAP as if they were prepared by the Air Force. The Air Force executes a ROD for its program decisions that are based on an EIS for which the Air Force is a cooperating agency. The Air Force may also be a lead or cooperating agency on an EA using similar procedures, but the MAJCOM EPC retains approval authority unless otherwise directed by HQ USAF. Before invoking provisions of 40 CFR 1501.5(e), the lowest authority level possible resolves disputes concerning which agency is the lead agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Adoption of EA or EIS.</E> The Air Force, even though not a cooperating agency, may adopt an EA or EIS prepared by another entity where the proposed action is substantially the same <PRTPAGE P="199"/>as the action described in the EA or EIS. In this case, the EA or EIS must be recirculated as a final EA or EIS but the Air Force must independently review the EA or EIS and determine that it is current and that it satisfies the requirements of this part. The Air Force then prepares its own FONSI or ROD, as the case may be. In the situation where the proposed action is not substantially the same as that described in the EA or the EIS, the Air Force may adopt the EA or EIS, or a portion thereof, by circulating the EA or EIS as a draft and then preparing the final EA or EIS.</P>

              <P>(a) CATEXs define those categories of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have potential for significant effect on the environment and do not, therefore, require further environmental analysis in an EA or an EIS. The list of Air Force-approved CATEXs is in appendix B. Supplements to this part may not add CATEXs or expand the scope of the CATEXs in appendix B.</P>
              <P>(b) Characteristics of categories of actions that usually do not require either an EIS or an EA (in the absence of extraordinary circumstances) include:</P>
              <P>(1) Minimal adverse effect on environmental quality.</P>
              <P>(2) No significant change to existing environmental conditions.</P>
              <P>(3) No significant cumulative environmental impact.</P>

              <P>(5) Similarity to actions previously assessed and found to have no significant environmental impacts.</P>
              <P>(c) CATEXs apply to actions in the United States and abroad. General exemptions specific to actions abroad are in 32 CFR part 187. The EPF or other decision-maker forwards requests for additional exemption determinations for actions abroad to HQ USAF/A7CI with a justification letter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Environmental assessment.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) When a proposed action is one not usually requiring an EIS but is not categorically excluded, the EPF supports the proponent in preparing an EA (40 <PRTPAGE P="200"/>CFR 1508.9). Every EA must lead to either a FONSI, a decision to prepare an EIS, or no action on the proposal.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever a proposed action usually requires an EIS, the EPF responsible for the EIAP may prepare an EA to definitively determine if an EIS is required based on the analysis of environmental impacts. Alternatively, the EPF may choose to bypass the EA and proceed with preparation of an EIS.</P>
              <P>(c) An EA is a written analysis that:</P>
              <P>(1) Provides analysis sufficient to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI.</P>
              <P>(2) Aids the Air Force in complying with the NEPA when no EIS is required.</P>
              <P>(d) The length of an EA should be as short and concise as possible, while matching the magnitude of the proposal. An EA briefly discusses the need for the proposed action, reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, the affected environment, the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives (including the “no action” alternative), and a listing of agencies and persons consulted during preparation. The EA should not contain long descriptions or lengthy, detailed data. Rather, incorporate by reference background data to support the concise discussion of the proposal and relevant issues.</P>
              <P>(e) The format for the EA may be the same as the EIS. The alternatives section of an EA and an EIS are similar and should follow the alternatives analysis guidance outlined in § 989.8.</P>
              <P>(f) The EPF should design the EA to facilitate rapidly transforming the document into an EIS if the environmental analysis reveals a significant impact.</P>
              <P>(g) As a finding contained in the draft FONSI, a Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA) must be submitted (five hard copies and an electronic version) to the MAJCOM EPF when the alternative selected could be located in wetlands or floodplains, and must discuss why no other practicable alternative exists to avoid impacts. See AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management.</P>
              <P>(h) EAs and accompanying FONSIs that require the Air Force to make Clean Air Act General Conformity Determinations shall be submitted (five hard copies and an electronic version) through the MAJCOM EPF to HQ USAF/A7CI for SAF/IEE coordination. SAF/IEE signs all General Conformity Determinations; SAF/IEI will sign the companion FONSIs after coordination with SAF/IEE, when requested by the MAJCOM (see § 989.30).</P>
              <P>(i) In cases potentially involving a high degree of controversy or Air Force-wide concern, the MAJCOM, after consultation with HQ USAF/A7CI, may request HQ USAF ESOHC review and approval of an EA, or HQ USAF may direct the MAJCOM to forward an EA (five hard copies and an electronic version) for HQ USAF ESOHC review and approval.</P>
              <P>(j) As a minimum, the following EAs require MAJCOM approval because they involve topics of special importance or interest. Unless directed otherwise by HQ USAF/A7CI, the installation EPF must forward the following types of EAs to the MAJCOM EPF, along with an unsigned draft FONSI: (MAJCOMs can require other EAs to receive MAJCOM approval in addition to those types specified here.)</P>
              <P>(1) All EAs on non-Air Force proposals that require an Air Force decision, such as use of Air Force property for highways, space ports, and joint-use proposals.</P>
              <P>(2) EAs where mitigation to insignificance is accomplished in lieu of initiating an EIS (§ 989.22(c)).</P>
              <P>(k) A few examples of actions that normally require preparation of an EA (except as indicated in the CATEX list) include:</P>
              <P>(1) Public land withdrawals of less than 5,000 acres.</P>
              <P>(2) Minor mission realignments and aircraft beddowns.</P>
              <P>(3) New building construction on base within developed areas.</P>
              <P>(4) Minor modifications to Military Operating Areas (MOAs), air-to-ground weapons ranges, and military training routes.</P>

              <P>(l) The Air Force will involve other federal agencies, state, Tribal, and local governments, and the public in the preparation of EAs (40 CFR 1501.4(b) and 1506.6). The extent of involvement usually coincides with the <PRTPAGE P="201"/>magnitude and complexity of the proposed action and its potential environmental effect on the area. For proposed actions described in § 989.15(e)(2), use either the scoping process described in § 989.18 or the public notice process in § 989.24.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Finding of no significant impact.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The FONSI (40 CFR 1508.13) briefly describes why an action would not have a significant effect on the environment and thus will not be the subject of an EIS. The FONSI must summarize the EA or, preferably, have it attached and incorporated by reference, and must note any other environmental documents related to the action.</P>
              <P>(b) If the EA is not incorporated by reference, the FONSI must include:</P>
              <P>(1) Name of the action.</P>
              <P>(2) Brief description of the action (including alternatives considered and the chosen alternative).</P>
              <P>(3) Brief discussion of anticipated environmental effects.</P>
              <P>(4) Conclusions leading to the FONSI.</P>
              <P>(5) All mitigation actions that will be adopted with implementation of the proposal (see § 989.22).</P>
              <P>(c) Keep FONSIs as brief as possible. Only rarely should FONSIs exceed two typewritten pages. Stand-alone FONSIs without an attached EA may be longer.</P>
              <P>(d) For actions of regional or local interest, disseminate the FONSI according to § 989.24. The MAJCOM and NGB are responsible for release of FONSIs to regional offices of Federal agencies, the state single point of contact (SPOC), and state agencies concurrent with local release by the installations.</P>
              <P>(e) The EPF must make the EA and unsigned FONSI available to the affected public and provide the EA and unsigned FONSI to organizations and individuals requesting them and to whomever the proponent or the EPF has reason to believe is interested in the action, unless disclosure is precluded for security classification reasons. Draft EAs and unsigned draft FONSIs will be clearly identified as drafts and distributed via cover letter which will explain their purpose and need. The EPF provides a copy of the documents without cost to organizations and individuals requesting them. The FONSI transmittal date (date of letter of transmittal) to the state SPOC or other equivalent agency is the official notification date.</P>
              <P>(1) Before the FONSI is signed and the action is implemented, the EPF should allow sufficient time to receive comments from the public. The time period will reflect the magnitude of the proposed action and its potential for controversy. The greater the magnitude of the proposed action or its potential for controversy, the longer the time that must be allowed for public review. Mandatory review periods for certain defined actions are contained in § 989.15(e)(2). These are not all inclusive but merely specific examples. In every case where an EA and FONSI are prepared, the proponent and EPF must determine how much time will be allowed for public review. In all cases, other than classified actions, a public review period should be the norm unless clearly unnecessary due to the lack of potential controversy.</P>
              <P>(2) In the following circumstances, the EA and unsigned FONSI are made available for public review for at least 30 days before FONSI approval and implementing the action (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)):</P>
              <P>(i) When the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one that usually requires preparation of an EIS (see § 989.16).</P>
              <P>(ii) If it is an unusual case, a new kind of action, or a precedent-setting case in terms of its potential environmental impacts.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the proposed action would be located in a floodplain or wetland.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the action is mitigated to insignificance in the FONSI, in lieu of an EIS (§ 989.22(c)).</P>
              <P>(v) If the proposed action is a change to airspace use or designation.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the proposed action would have a disproportionately high and adverse environmental effect on minority populations and low-income populations.</P>

              <P>(f) As a general rule, the same organizational level that prepares the EA also reviews and recommends the FONSI for approval by the EPC. MAJCOMs may decide the level of EA <PRTPAGE P="202"/>approval and FONSI signature, except as provided in § 989.14(g), (h), (i), and (j).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scoping.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After publication of the NOI for an EIS, the EPF must initiate the public scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7) to determine the scope of issues to be addressed and to help identify significant environmental issues to be analyzed in depth. Methods of scoping range from soliciting written comments to conducting public scoping meetings (see 40 CFR 1501.7 and 1506.6(e)). The scoping process is an iterative, pro-active process of communicating with individual citizens, neighborhood, community, and local leaders, public interest groups, congressional delegations, state, Tribal, and local governments, and federal agencies. The scoping process must start prior to official public scoping meetings and continue through to preparation of the draft EIS. The purpose of this process is to de-emphasize insignificant issues and focus the scope of the environmental analysis on significant issues (40 CFR 1500.4(g)). Additionally, scoping allows early and more meaningful participation by the public. The result of scoping is that the proponent and EPF determine the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts to be considered in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25). The EPF must send scripts for scoping meetings to HQ USAF/A7CI (or ANGRC/CEV) no later than 30 days before the first scoping meeting. Scoping meeting plans are similar in content to public hearing plans (see appendix C). Public scoping meetings should generally be held at locations not on the installation.</P>

              <P>(b) Where it is anticipated the proposed action and its alternatives will have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations or low-income populations, special efforts <PRTPAGE P="203"/>shall be made to reach these populations. This might include special informational meetings or notices in minority and low-income areas concerning the regular scoping process.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Preliminary draft.</E> The EPF supports the proponent in preparation of a preliminary draft EIS (PDEIS) (40 CFR 1502.9) based on the scope of issues decided on during the scoping process. The format of the EIS must be in accordance with the format recommended in the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10 and 1502.11). The CEQ regulations indicate that EISs normally contain fewer than 150 pages (300 pages for proposals of unusual complexity). The EPF provides a sufficient number of copies of the PDEIS to HQ USAF/A7CI for HQ USAF ESOHC security and policy review in each member's area of responsibility and to AFCEE/TDB for technical review.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of draft EIS.</E> After the HQ USAF ESOHC review, the EPF assists the appropriate Air Force organization in making any necessary revisions to the PDEIS and forwards it to HQ USAF/A7CI as a draft EIS to ensure completion of all security and policy reviews and to certify releasability. Once the draft EIS is approved, HQ USAF/A7CI notifies the EPF to print sufficient copies of the draft EIS for distribution to congressional delegations and interested agencies at least 7 calendar days prior to publication of the Notice of Availability (NOA) in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> After congressional distribution, the EPF sends the draft EIS to all others on the distribution list. HQ USAF/A7CI then files the document with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and provides a copy to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Public review of draft EIS (40 CFR 1502.19 and 1506.6):</E> (1) The public comment period for the draft EIS is at least 45 days starting from the publication date of the NOA of the draft EIS in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> USEPA publishes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> NOAs of EISs filed during the preceding week. This public comment period may be extended by the EPF. If the draft EIS is unusually long, the EPF may distribute a summary to the public with an attached list of locations (such as public libraries) where the entire draft EIS may be reviewed. The EPF must distribute the full draft EIS to certain entities, for example, agencies with jurisdiction by law or agencies with special expertise in evaluating the environmental impacts, and anyone else requesting the entire draft EIS (40 CFR 1502.19 and 1506.6).</P>

              <P>(2) The EPF sponsors public hearings on the draft EIS according to the procedures in appendix C to this part. Hearings take place no sooner than 15 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication of the NOA and at least 15 days before the end of the comment period. Scheduling hearings toward the end of the comment period is encouraged to allow the public to obtain and more thoroughly review the draft EIS. The EPF must provide hearing scripts to HQ USAF/A7CI (or ANGRC/CEV) no later than 30 days prior to the first public hearing. Public hearings should generally be held at off-base locations. Submit requests to deviate from procedures in appendix C to this part to HQ USAF/A7CI for SAF/IEI approval.</P>
              <P>(3) Where analyses indicate that a proposed action will potentially have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations or low-income populations, the EPF should make special efforts to ensure that these potentially impacted populations are brought into the review process.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Response to comments (40 CFR 1503.4).</E> The EPF must incorporate in the Final EIS its responses to comments on the Draft EIS by modifying the text and referring in the appendix to where the comment is addressed or providing a written explanation in the comments section, or both. The EPF may group comments of a similar nature together to allow a common response and may also respond to individuals separately.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Seeking additional comments.</E> The EPF may, at any time during the EIS process, seek additional public comments, such as when there has been a <PRTPAGE P="204"/>significant change in circumstances, development of significant new information of a relevant nature, or where there is substantial environmental controversy concerning the proposed action. Significant new information leading to public controversy regarding the scope after the scoping process is such a changed circumstance. An additional public comment period may also be necessary after the publication of the draft EIS due to public controversy or changes made as the result of previous public comments. Such periods when additional public comments are sought shall last for at least 30 days.</P>

              <P>(a) If changes in the draft EIS are minor or limited to factual corrections and responses to comments, the proponent and EPF may, with the prior approval of HQ USAF/A7CI and SAF/IEI, prepare a document containing only comments on the Draft EIS, Air Force responses, and errata sheets of changes staffed to the HQ USAF ESOHC for coordination. However, the EPF must submit the Draft EIS and all of the above documents, with a new cover sheet indicating that it is a final EIS (40 CFR 1503.4(c)), to HQ USAF/A7CI for filing with the EPA (40 CFR 1506.9). If more extensive modifications are required, the EPF must prepare a preliminary final EIS incorporating these modifications for coordination within the Air Force. Regardless of which procedure is followed, the final EIS must be processed in the same way as the draft EIS, including receipt of copies of the EIS by SAF/LLP, except that the public need not be invited to comment during the 30-day post-filing waiting period. The Final EIS should be furnished to every person, organization, or agency that made substantive comments on the Draft EIS or requested a copy. Although the EPF is not required to respond to public comments received during this period, comments received must be considered in determining final decisions such as identifying the preferred alternative, appropriate mitigations, or if a supplemental analysis is required.</P>
              <P>(b) The EPF processes all necessary supplements to EISs (40 CFR 1502.9) in the same way as the original Draft and Final EIS, except that a new scoping process is not required.</P>
              <P>(c) If major steps to advance the proposal have not occurred within 5 years from the date of the Final EIS approval, reevaluation of the documentation should be accomplished to ensure its continued validity.</P>

              <P>(a) The proponent and the EPF prepare a draft ROD, formally staff it through the MAJCOM EPC, to HQ USAF/A7CI for verification of adequacy, and forwards it to either SAF/IEI or SAF/AQR, as the case may be, for approval and designation of the signator. A ROD (40 CFR 1505.2) is a concise public document stating what an agency's decision is on a specific action. The ROD may be integrated into any other document required to implement the agency's decision. A decision on a course of action may not be made until the later of the following dates:</P>
              <P>(1) 90 days after publication of the DEIS; or</P>

              <P>(2) 30 days after publication of the NOA of the Final EIS in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The Air Force must announce the ROD to the affected public as specified in § 989.24, except for classified portions. The ROD should be concise and should explain the conclusion, the reason for the selection, and the alternatives considered. The ROD must identify the course of action, whether it is the proposed action or an alternative, that is considered environmentally preferable regardless of whether it is the alternative selected for implementation. The ROD should summarize all the major factors the agency weighed in making its decision, including essential considerations of national policy.</P>

              <P>(c) The ROD must state whether the selected alternative employs all practicable means to avoid, minimize, or <PRTPAGE P="205"/>mitigate environmental impacts and, if not, explain why not.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mitigation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When preparing EIAP documents, indicate clearly whether mitigation measures (40 CFR 1508.20) must be implemented for the alternative selected. If using Best Management Practices (BMPs), identify the specific BMPs being used and include those BMPs in the mitigation plan. Discuss mitigation measures in terms of “will” and “would” when such measures have already been incorporated into the proposal. Use terms like “may” and “could” when proposing or suggesting mitigation measures. Both the public and the Air Force community need to know what commitments are being considered and selected, and who will be responsible for implementing, funding, and monitoring the mitigation measures.</P>
              <P>(b) The proponent funds and implements mitigation measures in the mitigation plan that is approved by the decision-maker. Where possible and appropriate because of amount, the proponent should include the cost of mitigation as a line item in the budget for a proposed project. The proponent must ensure compliance with mitigation requirements, monitoring their effectiveness, and must keep the EPF informed of the mitigation status. The EPF reports its status, through the MAJCOM, to HQ USAF/A7CI when requested. Upon request, the EPF must also provide the results of relevant mitigation monitoring to the public.</P>
              <P>(c) The proponent may “mitigate to insignificance” potentially significant environmental impacts found during preparation of an EA, in lieu of preparing an EIS. The FONSI for the EA must include these mitigation measures. Such mitigations are legally binding and must be carried out as the proponent implements the project. If, for any reason, the project proponent later abandons or revises in environmentally adverse ways the mitigation commitments made in the FONSI, the proponent must prepare a supplemental EIAP document before continuing the project. If potentially significant environmental impacts would result from any project revisions, the proponent must prepare an EIS.</P>
              <P>(d) For each FONSI or ROD containing mitigation measures, the proponent prepares a plan specifically identifying each mitigation, discussing how the proponent will execute the mitigations, identifying who will fund and implement the mitigations, and stating when the proponent will complete the mitigation. The mitigation plan will be forwarded, through the MAJCOM EPF to HQ USAF/A7CI for review within 90 days from the date of signature of the FONSI or ROD.</P>

              <P>(c) For actions of local concern, the list of possible notification methods in 40 CFR 1506.6(b)(3) is only illustrative. The EPF may use other equally effective means of notification as a substitute for any of the methods listed. Because many Air Force actions are of limited interest to persons or organizations outside the Air Force, the EPF <PRTPAGE P="206"/>may limit local notification to the SPOC, local government representatives, and local news media. For all actions covered under § 989.15(e)(2), and for all EIS notices, the public affairs office must purchase with EPF funds an advertisement in a prominent section of the local newspaper(s) of general circulation (not “legal” newspapers or “legal section” of general newspapers).</P>
              <P>(d) For the purpose of EIAP, the EPF begins the time period of local notification when it sends written notification to the state SPOC or other equivalent agency (date of letter of notification).</P>

              <P>Base closure or realignment may entail special requirements for environmental analysis. The permanent base closure and realignment law, 10 U.S.C. 2687, requires a report to the Congress when an installation where at least 300 DoD civilian personnel are authorized to be employed is closed, or when a realignment reduces such an installation by at least 50 percent or 1,000 of such personnel, whichever is less. In addition, other base closure laws may be in effect during particular periods. Such nonpermanent closure laws frequently contain provisions limiting the extent of environmental analysis required for actions taken under them. Such provisions may also add requirements for studies not necessarily required by NEPA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Classified actions (40 CFR 1507.3(c)).</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Classification of an action for national defense or foreign policy purposes does not relieve the requirement of complying with NEPA. In classified matters, the Air Force must prepare and make available normal NEPA environmental analysis documents to aid in the decision-making process; however, Air Force staff must prepare, safeguard, and disseminate these documents according to established procedures for protecting classified documents. If an EIAP document must be classified, the Air Force may modify or eliminate associated requirements for public notice (including publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>) or public involvement in the EIAP. However, the Air Force should obtain comments on classified proposed actions or classified aspects of generally unclassified actions, from public agencies having jurisdiction by law or special expertise, to the extent that such review and comment is consistent with security requirements. Where feasible, the EPF may need to help appropriate personnel from those agencies obtain necessary security clearances to gain access to documents so they can comment on scoping or review the documents.</P>
              <P>(b) Where the proposed action is classified and unavailable to the public, the Air Force may keep the entire NEPA process classified and protected under the applicable procedures for the classification level pertinent to the particular information. At times (for example, during weapons system development and base closures and realignments), certain but not all aspects of NEPA documents may later be declassified. In those cases, the EPF should organize the EIAP documents, to the extent practicable, in a way that keeps the most sensitive classified information (which is not expected to be released at any early date) in a separate annex that can remain classified; the rest of the EIAP documents, when declassified, will then be comprehensible as a unit and suitable for release to the public. Thus, the documents will reflect, as much as possible, the nature of the action and its environmental impacts, as well as Air Force compliance with NEPA requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) Where the proposed action is not classified, but certain aspects of it need to be protected by security classification, the EPF should tailor the EIAP for a proposed action to permit as normal a level of public involvement as possible, but also fully protect the classified part of the action and environmental analysis. In some instances, the EPF can do this by keeping the classified sections of the EIAP documents in a separate, classified annex.</P>

              <P>(d) For § 989.26(b) actions, an NOI or NOA will not be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> until the proposed action is declassified. For § 989.26(c) actions, the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> will run an unclassified NOA which will advise <PRTPAGE P="207"/>the public that at some time in the future the Air Force may or will publicly release a declassified document.</P>
              <P>(e) The EPF similarly protects classified aspects of FONSIs, RODs, or other environmental documents that are part of the EIAP for a proposed action, such as by preparing separate classified annexes to unclassified documents, as necessary.</P>
              <P>(f) Whenever a proponent believes that EIAP documents should be kept classified, the EPF must make a report of the matter to SAF/IEI, including proposed modifications of the normal EIAP to protect classified information. The EPF may make such submissions at whatever level of security classification is needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues. SAF/IEI, with support from SAF/GC and other staff elements as necessary, makes final decisions on EIAP procedures for classified actions.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal Aviation Administration.</E> The DoD and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlines various airspace responsibilities. For purposes of compliance with NEPA, the DoD is the “lead agency” for all proposals initiated by DoD, with the FAA acting as the “cooperating agency.” Where airspace proposals initiated by the FAA affect military use, the roles are reversed. The proponent's action officers (civil engineering and local airspace management) must ensure that the FAA is fully integrated into the airspace proposal and related EIAP from the very beginning and that the action officers review the FAA's responsibilities as a cooperating agency. The proponent's airspace manager develops the preliminary airspace proposal per appropriate FAA handbooks and the FAA-DoD MOU. The preliminary airspace proposal is the basis for initial dialogue between DoD and the FAA on the proposed action. A close working relationship between DoD and the FAA, through the FAA regional Air Force representative, greatly facilitates the airspace proposal process and helps resolve many NEPA issues during the EIAP.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A.3.1. General Information</HD>
              <P>A3.1.1. The Office of the Judge Advocate General, through the Air Force Legal Services Agency/Trial Judiciary Division (AFLSA/JAJT) and its field organization, is responsible for conducting public hearings and assuring verbatim transcripts are accomplished.</P>
              <P>A3.1.2. The EPF, with proponent, AFLSA/JAJT, and Public Affairs support, establishes the date and location, arranges for hiring the court reporter, funds temporary duty costs for the hearing officer, makes logistical arrangements (for example, publishing notices, arranging for press coverage, obtaining tables and chairs, etc.).</P>
              <P>A3.1.3. The procedures outlined below have proven themselves through many prior applications. However, there may be rare instances when circumstances warrant conducting public hearings under a different format, e.g., public/town meeting, information booths, third party moderator, etc. In these cases, forward a request with justification to deviate from these procedures to HQ USAF/A7CI for SAF/IEE approval.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A3.2. Notice of Hearing (40 CFR 1506.6)</HD>
              <P>A3.2.1. Public Affairs officers:</P>
              <P>A3.2.1.1. Announce public hearings and assemble a mailing list of individuals to be invited.</P>
              <P>A3.2.1.2. Distribute announcements of a hearing to all interested individuals and agencies, including the print and electronic media.</P>
              <P>A3.2.1.3. Place a newspaper display advertisement announcing the time and place of the hearing as well as other pertinent particulars.</P>
              <P>A3.2.1.4. Distribute the notice in a timely manner so it will reach recipients or be published at least 15 days before the hearing date. Distribute notices fewer than 15 days before the hearing date when you have substantial justification and if the justification for a shortened notice period appears in the notice.</P>
              <P>A3.2.1.5. Develop and distribute news release.</P>

              <P>A3.2.2. If an action has effects of national concern, publish notices in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and mail notices to national organizations that have an interest in the matter.</P>

              <P>A3.2.2.1. Because of the longer lead time required by the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> send out notices for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to arrive at HQ USAF/A7CI no later than 30 days before the hearing date.</P>
              <P>A3.2.3. The notice should include:</P>

              <P>A3.2.3.4. A suggestion that speakers submit (in writing or by return call) their intention to participate, with an indication of which environmental impact (or impacts) they wish to address.</P>
              <P>A3.2.3.5. Any limitation on the length of oral statements.</P>
              <P>A3.2.3.6. A suggestion that speakers submit statements of considerable length in writing.</P>
              <P>A3.2.3.7. A summary of the proposed action.</P>
              <P>A3.2.3.8. The location where the draft EIS and any appendices are available for examination.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A.3.3. Availability of the Draft EIS to the Public</HD>
              <P>The EPF makes copies of the Draft EIS available to the public at an Air Force installation and other reasonably accessible place in the vicinity of the proposed action and public hearing (e.g., public library).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A3.4. Place of the Hearing</HD>
              <P>The EPF arranges to hold the hearing at a time and place and in an area readily accessible to military and civilian organizations and individuals interested in the proposed action. Generally, the EPF should arrange to hold the hearing in an off-base civilian facility, which is more accessible to the public.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A3.5. Hearing Officer</HD>

              <P>A3.5.1. The AFLOA/JAJT selects a hearing officer to preside over hearings. The hearing officer does not need to have personal knowledge of the project, other than familiarity with the Draft EIS. In no event should the hearing officer be a judge advocate from the proponent or subordinate command, be assigned to the same installation with which the hearing is concerned, or have participated personally in the development of the project, or have rendered legal advice or assistance with respect to it (or be expected to <PRTPAGE P="215"/>do so in the future). The principal qualification of the hearing officer should be the ability to conduct a hearing as an impartial participant.</P>
              <P>A3.5.2. The primary duties of the hearing officer are to make sure that the hearing is orderly, is recorded, and that interested parties have a reasonable opportunity to speak. The presiding officer should direct the speakers' attention to the purpose of the hearing, which is to consider the environmental impacts of the proposed project. Speakers should have a time limit to ensure maximum public input to the decision-maker.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A3.6. Record of the Hearing</HD>
              <P>The EIS preparation team must make sure a verbatim transcribed record of the hearing is prepared, including all stated positions, all questions, and all responses. The EIS preparation team should append all written submissions that parties provide to the hearing officer during the hearing to the record as attachments. The EIS preparation team should also append a list of persons who spoke at the hearing and submitted written comments and a list of the organizations or interests they represent with addresses. The EIS preparation team must make sure a verbatim transcript of the hearing is provided to the EPF for inclusion as an appendix to the Final EIS. The officer should also ensure that all persons who request a copy of the transcript get a copy when it is completed. Copying charges are determined according to 40 CFR 1506.6(f).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A3.7. Hearing Format</HD>
              <P>Use the format outlined below as a general guideline for conducting a hearing. Hearing officers should tailor the format to meet the hearing objectives. These objectives provide information to the public, record opinions of interested persons on environmental impacts of the proposed action, and set out alternatives for improving the EIS and for later consideration.</P>
              <P>A3.7.1. Record of Attendees. The hearing officer should make a list of all persons who wish to speak at the hearing to help the hearing officer in calling on these individuals, to ensure an accurate transcript of the hearing, and to enable the officer to send a copy of the Final EIS (40 CFR 1502.19) to any person, organization, or agency that provided substantive comments at the hearing. The hearing officer should assign assistants to the entrance of the hearing room to provide cards on which individuals can voluntarily write their names, addresses, telephone numbers, organizations they represent, and titles; whether they desire to make a statement at the hearing; and what environmental area(s) they wish to address. The hearing officer can then use the cards to call on individuals who desire to make statements. However, the hearing officer will not deny entry to the hearing or the right to speak to people who decline to submit this information on cards.</P>
              <P>A3.7.2. Introductory Remarks. The hearing officer should first introduce himself or herself and the EIS preparation team. Then the hearing officer should make a brief statement on the purpose of the hearing and give the general ground rules on how it will be conducted. This is the proper time to welcome any dignitaries who are present. The hearing officer should explain that he or she does not make any recommendation or decision on whether the proposed project should be continued, modified, or abandoned or how the EIS should be prepared.</P>
              <P>A3.7.3. Explanation of the Proposed Action. The Air Force EIS preparation team representative should next explain the proposed action, the alternatives, the potential environmental consequences, and the EIAP.</P>
              <P>A3.7.4. Questions by Attendees. After the EIS team representative explains the proposed action, alternatives, and consequences, the hearing officer should give attendees a chance to ask questions to clarify points they may not have understood. The EIS preparation team may have to reply in writing, at a later date, to some of the questions. While the Air Force EIS preparation team should be as responsive as possible in answering questions about the proposal, they should not become involved in debate with questioners over the merits of the proposed action. Cross-examination of speakers, either those of the Air Force or the public, is not the purpose of an informal hearing. If necessary, the hearing officer may limit questioning or conduct portions of the hearing to ensure proper lines of inquiry. However, the hearing officer should include all questions in the hearing record.</P>
              <P>A3.7.5. Statement of Attendees. The hearing officer must give the persons attending the hearing a chance to present oral or written statements. The hearing officer should be sure the recorder has the name and address of each person who submits an oral or written statement. The officer should also permit the attendees to submit written statements within a reasonable time, usually two weeks, following the hearing. The officer should allot a reasonable length of time at the hearing for receiving oral statements. The officer may waive any announced time limit at his or her discretion. The hearing officer may allow those who have not previously indicated a desire to speak to identify themselves and be recognized only after those who have previously indicated their intentions to speak have spoken.</P>

              <P>A3.7.6. Ending or Extending a Hearing. The hearing officer has the power to end the hearing if the hearing becomes disorderly, if the speakers become repetitive, or for other <PRTPAGE P="216"/>good cause. In any such case, the hearing officer must make a statement for the record on the reasons for terminating the hearing. The hearing officer may also extend the hearing beyond the originally announced date and time. The officer should announce the extension to a later date or time during the hearing and prior to the hearing if possible.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A3.8. Adjourning the Hearing</HD>

              <P>After all persons have had a chance to speak, when the hearing has culled a representative view of public opinion, or when the time set for the hearing and any reasonable extension of time has ended, the hearing officer adjourns the hearing. In certain circumstances (for example, if the hearing officer believes it is likely that some participants will introduce new and relevant information), the hearing officer may justify scheduling an additional, separate hearing session. If the hearing officer makes the decision to hold another hearing while presiding over the original hearing he or she should announce that another public hearing will be scheduled or is under consideration. The officer gives notice of a decision to continue these hearings in essentially the same way he or she announced the original hearing, time permitting. The Public Affairs officer provides the required public notices and directs notices to interested parties in coordination with the hearing officer. Because of lead-time constraints, SAF/IEE may waive <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice requirements or advertisements in local publications. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer should inform the attendees of the deadline (usually 2 weeks) to submit additional written remarks in the hearing record. The officer should also notify attendees of the deadline for the commenting period of the Draft EIS.</P>

              <P>(a) The operation of a POV on a DLA activity constitutes a conditional privilege extended by the Head of the activity. The Heads of DLA primary level field activities (PLFA's) have the authority to supplement this regulation to implement additional controls and restraints warranted by existing conditions at a PLFA. For example, commanders of depots and supply centers may impose searches of vehicles as warranted to reduce pilferage, and protect Government interests.<PRTPAGE P="225"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) POV's permanently registered for operation on a DLA activity will be identified by use of one of the decals prescribed in this part 1288 (appendices A and B).</P>
              <P>(c) The DLA vehicle decal will be valid for a period of 3 years from the year and month of issue.</P>
              <P>(d) Activities will use DLA Form 1454, Vehicle Registration/Driver Record, as the basic vehicle registration and driver record.</P>
              <P>(e) DLA tenant activities will comply with host installation policies and procedures for registering POV's.</P>

              <P>(a) DoD Instruction 6055.4 requires that all traffic violations occurring on DoD installations be referred to the appropriate United States Magistrate, or State or local system magistrate, in the interest of impartial judicial determination and effective law enforcement. Exceptions will be made only for those rare violations in which military discipline is the paramount consideration, or where the Federal court system having jurisdiction has notified the PLFA commander it will not accept certain offenses for disposition.</P>
              <P>(b) Generally, the Federal Magistrate System applies state traffic laws and appropriate Federal laws to all personnel while on Federal property (section 13, title 18 U.S.C., Assimilative Crimes Act).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">The U.S. Magistrate Court Provides DLA</E> with:</P>
              <P>(1) The means to process and dispose of certain categories of minor offenses by mail. Under this system, U.S. Magistrate and District Courts will, by local court rule, preset fines for the bulk of petty violations (Federal or Assimilated) and permit persons charged with such violations, who do not contest the charge nor wish to have a court hearing, to pay their fines by using mail-in, preaddressed, postage paid envelopes furnished to them with the violation notice.</P>
              <P>(2) Efficient, minimal commitment of judicial and clerical time by using uniform procedures which centralize the collection of fines, the scheduling of mandatory hearings or hearings where violators request them, and the keeping of violator records.</P>
              <P>(3) A simple but sure method of accounting for fines collected and tickets issued.</P>
              <P>(4) Impartial enforcement of minor offense laws.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Court Appearances</E>—(1) <E T="03">Mandatory Appearances.</E> (i) As required by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, each District Court will determine, by local court rule, those offenses requiring mandatory appearance of violators. PLFA Counsels will coordinate with local magistrates or district courts and secure a court approved list of offenses requiring mandatory appearance of violators before the local U.S. Magistrate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Mandatory appearance offense categories normally include:</P>
              <P>(A) Indictable offenses.</P>
              <P>(B) Offenses resulting in accidents.</P>
              <P>(C) Operation of motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or a narcotic or habit producing or other mind altering drug, or permitting another person who is under the influence of intoxicating alcohol, or a narcotic or habit producing or mind altering drug to operate a motor vehicle owned by the defendant or in his/her custody or control.</P>
              <P>(D) Reckless driving or speeding.</P>
              <P>(2) Voluntary Appearances—(i) <E T="03">Requested by violators at the time DD Form 1805 is issued.</E> (A) Personnel issuing DD Form 1805 will refer violator for hearings before U.S. Magistrates in each instance where a hearing is requested by the violator.</P>
              <P>(B) Command security officers will provide security force personnel with necessary information to facilitate scheduling violators to appear before U.S. Magistrates. Box B of the DD Form 1805 will be marked by the issuing official for each violator requesting a hearing. Additionally procedures set forth in appendix A will be accomplished by the official issuing violation notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Requested by violators by mail.</E> (A) Voluntary appearance procedures are also available for violators who are not present at the time a DD Form 1805 is issued (i.e., parking violations) or who subsequently decide to voluntarily appear before a U.S. Magistrate rather than pay the fine indicated in the DD Form 1805.</P>
              <P>(B) Violators who use the mail-in procedure to voluntarily appear before a U.S. Magistrate must follow the instructions in Box B of the DD Form 1805 (violator copy). The violator will be notified by the clerk of the District Court of the time and place to appear for the scheduled hearing.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1290.9</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Forms and reports.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General information on preparation and issue of DD Form 1805.</E> (1) The U.S. Magistrate system is based on use of a four-ply ticket designed to provide legal notice to violators and records required by the court, law enforcement authorities, and, if appropriate, the state motor vehicle departments. The DD Form 1805 is printed on chemically <PRTPAGE P="230"/>carbonized paper and prenumbered in series for accounting control. Heads of DLA primary level field activities are responsible for maintaining accountability for each ticket issued and stocks on hand.</P>
              <P>(2) DLA field activity Counsels will coordinate with the U.S. Magistrate of the judicial district in which the activity is located and maintain the information listed below:</P>
              <P>(i) List of petty offenses for which mail-in procedure is authorized and the amount of the fine for each specific offense. The District Court address will be prestamped on the violator's copy of the DD Form 1805 by the applicable issuing authority.</P>
              <P>(ii) List of minor offenses requiring mandatory appearance of the violator before the magistrate. The name and location of the magistrate before whom violators will appear. Schedule will be coordinated with nearest Military Service activity and appearance will be conducted jointly whenever possible.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Issue procedures for DD Form 1805.</E> (1) Information entered on the DD Form 1805 is dependent upon two considerations:</P>
              <P>(i) The type of violation, i.e., parking, (such as blocking a fire lane) moving traffic violation, or nontraffic offenses.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether the offense cited requires the mandatory appearance of the violator before a U.S. Magistrate.</P>
              <P>(2) Preparation and disposition of DD Form 1805:</P>
              <P>(i) See illustration in appendix B for petty offenses where the mail-in fine procedures are authorized.</P>
              <P>(A) The amount of the fine for a specific offense must be recorded in the lower right corner of the DD Form 1805. This amount will always be predetermined by the U.S. Magistrate and provided to on duty enforcement personnel by the activity security officer or equivalent authority. When violation notices are issued for an offense (e.g., parking violation) and the offender is absent, all entries concerning the violator will be left blank.</P>
              <P>(B) Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator or placed on the vehicle of the violator.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security Officer will forward copies one and two, by letter of transmittal, to the appropriate U.S. District Court.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Copy three will be filed at the Security Office or equivalent issuing authority. DLA Form 1454, Vehicle Registration/Driver Record, will be annotated with each traffic offense.</P>
              <P>(ii) When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mail-in type violations, the appropriate supervisor will be provided an information copy of DLA Form 635, Security/Criminal Incident Report, denoting the date, time, place, and type of violation, and the amount of fine assessed.</P>
              <P>(iii) Heads of DLA primary level field activities or their representative will not accept or otherwise collect any fines or keep records of fines paid or not paid. They also will take no action concerning nonpayment delinquencies except where warrants are subsequently issued for the violator concerned by the appropriate court authorities.</P>
              <P>(iv) See illustrations in appendices C and D for minor offenses requiring the mandatory appearance of violators before the U.S. Magistrate:</P>
              <P>(A) Mail-in fine procedures will not apply in mandatory appearance cases. The law enforcement authority issuing a violation notice for an offense requiring mandatory appearance of the violator, will place a check mark in “Box A”, DD Form 1805. The name and location of the U.S. Magistrate before whom the violator must appear will be inserted on the line below “United States District Court” as shown in appendix C. The date and time of the initial appearance will be entered in the space provided in “Box A”. It is the violator's responsibility to verify the date, time, and place of required court appearances.</P>
              <P>(B) Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security Officer will forward <PRTPAGE P="231"/>copies one and two, by transmittal as soon as possible, to the magistrate before whom the violator is scheduled to appear.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Copy three will be filed in the office of the Security Officer or equivalent issuing authority.</P>
              <P>(C) When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mandatory appearance type offenses, the individual's supervisor will be provided an information copy of DLA Form 635, denoting the date, time, place, and type of violation, and the date the violator is scheduled to appear before the U.S. Magistrate.</P>
              <P>(v) Additional information governing preparation of DD Form 1805 is provided as appendix A.</P>

            <P>When the Director orders a registrant for examination, it shall be the duty of the registrant to report for and submit to examination at the time and place ordered unless the order has been canceled. If the time when the registrant is ordered to report for examination is postponed, it shall be the continuing duty of the registrant to report for and submit to examination at such time and place as he may be reordered. Regardless of the time when, or the circumstances under which a registrant fails to report for examination when it is his duty to do so, it shall thereafter be his continuing duty from day to day to report for and submit to examination at the place specified in the order to report for examination.</P>

            <P>(a) The Director of Selective Service shall from time to time establish a random selection sequence for induction by a drawing to be conducted in the place and on a date the Director shall fix. The random selection method shall use 365 days, or when appropriate, 366 days to represent the birthdays (month and day only) of all registrants who, during the specified calendar year(s) attain their 18th year of birth. The drawing, commencing with the first day selected, and continuing until all 365 days or, when appropriate 366 days are drawn, shall be accomplished impartially. The random sequence number thus determined for any registrant shall apply to him so long as he remains subject to induction for military training and service by random selection.</P>
            <P>(b) The date of birth of the registrant that appears on his Selective Service Registration Record on the day before the lottery is conducted to establish his random selection sequence will be conclusive as to his date of birth in all matters pertaining to his relations with the Selective Service System.</P>

Orders shall be issued in such numbers and at such times as will assure that such call or requisition is filled. The names contained in the Selective Service System data base on a given day will constitute the valid list of registrants from which induction orders can be issued on that day.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Order to report for induction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Immediately upon determining which persons are to be ordered for induction, the Director of Selective Service shall issue to each person selected an Order to Report for Induction. The order will be sent to the current address most recently provided by the registrant to the Selective Service System. The date specified to report for induction shall be at least 10 days after the date on which the Order to Report for Induction is issued. The filing of a claim for reclassification in accord with § 1633.2 of this chapter delays the date the registrant is required to report for induction until not earlier than the tenth day after the claim is determined to have been abandoned or is finally determined is finally determined in accord with the provisions of this chapter. A claim is finally determined when the registrant does not have the right to appeal the last classification action with respect to the claim or he fails to exercise his right to appeal.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person who has been ordered for induction who is distant from the address to which the order was sent must either report at the time and place specified in the order, or voluntarily submit himself for induction processing at another MEPS on or before the day that he was required to report in accordance with his induction order.</P>
            <P>(c) The Director of Selective Service may direct the cancellation of any Order to Report for Induction at any time.</P>
            <P>(d) Any Order to Report for Induction issued by the Director of Selective Service to a registrant who is an alien, who has not resided in the United States for one year will be void. Such order will be deemed only to be an order to produce evidence of his status. When an alien registrant has been within the United States for two or more periods (including periods before his registration) and the total of such periods equals one year, he shall be deemed to have resided in the United States for one year. In computing the length of such periods, any portion of one day shall be counted as a day. Upon establishing a one year residency, the alien registrant will be assigned to the age selection group corresponding to his age.</P>

The period of postponement shall not exceed 60 days from the date of the induction order. When necessary, the Director may grant one further postponement, but the total postponement shall not exceed 90 days from the reporting date on the induction order.</P>

            <P>(i) Until the time of his graduation therefrom; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Until he attains the twentieth anniversary of his birth; or</P>

            <P>(iv) Until he ceases satisfactorily to pursue such course of instruction, whichever is the earliest.</P>
            <P>(2) Any registrant who, while satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning, is ordered to report for induction shall, upon the presentation of appropriate facts in the manner prescribed by the Director of Selective Service, have his induction postponed:</P>
            <P>(i) Until the end of the semester or term, or in the case of his last academic year, the end of the academic year; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Until he ceases to satisfactorily pursue such course of instruction, whichever is the earlier.</P>
            <P>(3) A postponement authorized by this subsection may be terminated by the Director of Selective Service for cause upon no less than 10 days notice to the registrant.</P>
            <P>(d) The Director of Selective Service may authorize a delay of induction for any registrant whose date of induction conflicts with a religious holiday historically observed by a recognized church, religious sect or religious organization of which he is a member. Any registrant so delayed shall report for induction on the next business day following the religious holiday.</P>
            <P>(e) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(f) The Director of Selective Service may authorize a postponement of induction to a registrant when:</P>
            <P>(1) The registrant qualifies and is scheduled for a State or National examination in a profession or occupation which requires certification before being authorized to engage in the practice of that profession or occupation; or</P>
            <P>(2) The registrant has been accepted in the next succeeding class as a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy, or the U.S. Air Force Academy, or the U.S. Coast Guard Academy; or as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, or the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy; or</P>
            <P>(3) The registrant is a ROTC applicant who has been designated to participate in the next succeeding ROTC field training program prior to enrollment in the ROTC; or</P>
            <P>(4) The registrant has been accepted as a ROTC scholarship student in the next succeeding ROTC program at a college or university.</P>
            <P>(g) The Director of Selective Service shall issue to each registrant whose induction is postponed a written notice thereof.</P>
            <P>(h) No registrant whose induction has been postponed shall be inducted into the Armed Forces during the period of any such postponement. A postponement of induction shall not render invalid the Order to Report for Induction which has been issued to the registrant, but shall operate only to postpone the reporting date, and the registrant shall report on the new date scheduled without having issued to him a new Order to Report for Induction.</P>

            <P>(i) Any registrant receiving a postponement under the provisions of this section, shall, after the expiration of such postponement, be rescheduled to report for induction at the place to which he was originally ordered.<PRTPAGE P="253"/>
            </P>
            <P>(j) The initial determination of claims for all postponements is made by area office compensated personnel. After a denial of a claim for a student postponement, the registrant may request the local board to consider the claim. Such registrant shall be afforded an opportunity to appeal before the board in accord with the procedures of §§ 1648.4 and 1648.5.</P>

The Director may, before issuing an induction order to a registrant, appropriately classify him if the Secretary of Defense has certified him to be a member of an armed force or reserve component thereof.</P>
            <P>(b) The National Selective Service Appeal Board may in accord with part 1653 of this chapter classify a registrant into any class for which he is eligible.</P>
            <P>(c) A district appeal board may in accord with part 1651 of this chapter classify a registrant into any class for which he is eligible.</P>
            <P>(d) A local board may in accord with part 1648 of this chapter classify a registrant into Class 1-A-0, 1-0, 2-D, 3-A, or 4-D for which he is eligible.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Claim for other than Class 1-A.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any registrant who has received an order to report for induction may, prior to the day he is scheduled to report, submit to the Selective Service System a claim that he is eligible to be classified into any class other than Class 1-A. The registrant may assert a claim that he is eligible for more than one class other than Class 1-A. The registrant cannot subsequently file a claim with respect to a class for which he was eligible prior to the day he was originally scheduled to report. Information and documentation in support of claims for reclassification and postponement of induction shall be filed in accordance with instructions from the Selective Service System.</P>
            <P>(b) Any registrant who has received an order to report for induction that has not been canceled may, at any time before his induction, submit a claim that he is eligible to be classified into any class other than Class 1-A based upon events over which he has no control that occurred on or after the day he was originally scheduled to report for induction.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Claims will be filed with the area office supporting the local board of jurisdiction.</P>

            <P>(2) Claims will be considered by the local board identified in paragraph (c)(1) or its supporting area office as prescribed in this part.<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) The initial determination of claims for all administrative classifications are made by area office compensated personnel. After a denial of a claim for an administrative classification the registrant may request the local board to consider the claim.</P>
            <P>(e) The initial determination of a judgmental classification is made by a local board.</P>
            <P>(f) A registrant may request and shall be granted a personal appearance whenever a local or appeal board considers his claim for reclassification. Personal appearances will be held in accord with parts 1648, 1651 and 1653 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(g) A registrant who has filed a claim for classification in Class 1-A-O or Class 1-0 shall be scheduled for a personal appearance in accord with § 1648.4 before his claim is considered.</P>
            <P>(h) If granted, a deferment or exemption supersedes the original order to report for induction. When a deferment or exemption expires or ends, a new order to report for induction will be issued.</P>

            <P>(b) A registrant's objection may be founded on religious training and belief; it may be based on strictly religious beliefs, or on personal beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source or centent and occupy in the life of a registrant a place parallel to that filled by belief in a Supreme Being for those holding more traditionally religious views.</P>

            <P>A registrant shall be excluded from Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0:</P>
            <P>(a) Who asserts beliefs which are of a religious, moral or ethical nature, but who is found not to be sincere in his assertions; or</P>
            <P>(b) Whose stated objection to participation in war does not rest at all upon moral, ethical, or religious principle, but instead rests solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, expediency, or his own self-interest or well-being; or</P>
            <P>(c) Whose objection to participation in war is directed against a particular war rather than against war in any form (a selective objection). If a registrant objects to war in any form, but also believes in a theocratic, spiritual war between the forces of good and evil, he may not by reason of that belief alone be considered a selective conscientious objector.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Analysis of belief.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A registrant claiming conscientious objection is not required to be a <PRTPAGE P="264"/>member of a <E T="03">peace church</E> or any other church, religious organization, or religious sect to qualify for a 1-A-0 or 1-0 classification; nor is it necessary that he be affiliated with any particular group opposed to participation in war in any form.</P>

            <P>(b) The registrant who identifies his beliefs with those of a traditional church or religious organization must show that he basically adheres to beliefs of that church or religious organization whether or not he is actually affiliated with the institution whose teachings he claims as the basis of his conscientious objection. He need not adhere to <E T="03">all</E> beliefs of that church or religious organization.</P>
            <P>(c) A registrant whose beliefs are not religious in the traditional sense, but are based primarily on moral or ethical principle should hold such beliefs with the same strength or conviction as the belief in a Supreme Being is held by a person who is religious in the traditional sense. Beliefs may be mixed; they may be a combination of traditional religious beliefs and nontraditional religious, moral or ethical beliefs. The registrant's beliefs must play a significant role in his life but should be evaluated only insofar as they pertain to his stated objection to his participation in war.</P>
            <P>(d) Where the registrant is or has been a member of a church, religious organization, or religious sect, and where his claim of a conscientious objection is related to such membership, the board may properly inquire as to the registrant's membership, the religious teachings of the church, religious organization, or religious sect, and the registrant's religious activity, insofar as each relates to his objection to participation in war. The fact that the registrant may disagree with or not subscribe to some of the tenets of his church or religious sect does not necessarily discredit his claim.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) The history of the process by which the registrant acquired his beliefs, whether founded on religious, moral, or ethical principle is relevant to the determination whether his stated opposition to participation in war in any form is sincere.</P>
            <P>(2) The registrant must demonstrate that his religious, ethical, or moral convictions were acquired through training, study, contemplation, or other activity comparable to the processes by which traditional religious convictions are formulated. He must show that these religious, moral, or ethical convictions, once acquired, have directed his life in the way traditional religious convictions of equal strength, depth, and duration have directed the lives of those whose beliefs are clearly founded in traditional religious conviction.</P>
            <P>(f) The registrant need not use formal or traditional language in describing the religious, moral, or ethical nature of his beliefs. Board members are not free to reject beliefs because they find them incomprehensible or inconsistent with their own beliefs.</P>
            <P>(g) Conscientious objection to participation in war in any form, if based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, may not be deemed disqualifying simply because those beliefs may influence the registrant concerning the Nation's domestic or foreign policy.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Considerations relevant to granting or denying a claim for classification as a conscientious objector.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) After the registrant has submitted a claim for classification as a conscientious objector and his file is complete, a determination of his sincerity will be made based on:</P>
            <P>(1) All documents in the registrant's file folder; and</P>
            <P>(2) The oral statements of the registrant at his personal appearance(s) before the local and/or appeal board; and</P>
            <P>(3) The oral statements of the registrant's witnesses, if any, at his personal appearance(s) before the local board; and</P>

            <P>(4) The registrant's general demeanor during his personal appearance(s).<PRTPAGE P="265"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) The registrant's stated convictions should be a matter of conscience.</P>
            <P>(c) The board should be convinced that the registrant's personal history since the crystallization of his conscientious objection is not inconsistent with his claim and demonstrates that the registrant's objection is not solely a matter of expediency. A recent crystallization of beliefs does not in itself indicate expediency.</P>
            <P>(d) The information presented by the registrant should reflect a pattern of behavior in response to war and weapons which is consistent with his stated beliefs. Instances of violent acts or conviction for crimes of violence, or employment in the development or manufacturing of weapons of war, if the claim is based upon or supported by a life of nonviolence, may be indicative of inconsistent conduct.</P>
            <P>(e) The development of a registrant's opposition to war in any form may bear on his sincerity. If the registrant claims a recent crystallization of beliefs, his claim should be supported by evidence of a religious or educational experience, a traumatic event, an historical occasion, or some other special situation which explains when and how his objection to participation in war crystallized.</P>
            <P>(f) In the event that a registrant has previously worked in the development of or manufacturing of weapons of war or has served as a member of a military reserve unit, it should be determined whether such activity was prior to the stated crystallization of the registrant's conscientious objector beliefs. Inconsistent conduct prior to the actual crystallization of conscientious objector beliefs is not necessarily indicative of insincerity. But, inconsistent conduct subsequent to such crystallization may indicate that registrant's stated objection is not sincere.</P>
            <P>(g) A registrant's behavior during his personal appearance before a board may be relevant to the sincerity of his claim.</P>
            <P>(1) Evasive answers to questions by board members or the use of hostile, belligerent, or threatening words or actions, for example, may in proper circumstances be deemed inconsistent with a claim in which the registrant bases his objection on a belief in nonviolence.</P>
            <P>(2) Care should be exercised that nervous, frightened, or apprehensive behavior at the personal appearance is not misconstrued as a reflection of insincerity.</P>
            <P>(h) Oral response to questions posed by board members should be consistent with the written statements of the registrant and should generally substantiate the submitted information in the registrant's file folder; any inconsistent material should be explained by the registrant. It is important to recognize that the registrant need not be eloquent in his answers. But, a clear inconsistency between the registrant's oral remarks at his personal appearance and his written submission to the board may be adequate grounds, if not satisfactorily explained, for concluding that his claim is insincere.</P>
            <P>(i) The registrant may submit letters of reference and other supporting statements of friends, relatives and acquaintances to corroborate the sincerity of his claim, although such supplemental documentation is not essential to approval of his claim. A finding of insincerity based on these letters or supporting statements must be carefully explained in the board's decision, specific mention being made of the particular material relied upon for denial of classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0.</P>

            <P>The following are the types of decisions which may be made by a board when a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0 has been considered.</P>
            <P>(a) Decision to grant a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0, as requested, based on a determination that the truth or sincerity of the registrant's claim is not refuted by any information contained in the registrant's file or obtained during his personal appearance.</P>

            <P>(b) Decision to deny a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0 based on all information before the board, and a finding that such information fails to meet the tests specified in <PRTPAGE P="266"/>§ 1636.3 or 1636.4 of this part. If supported by information contained in the registrant's file or obtained during his personal appearance the board may find that the facts presented by the registrant in support of his claim are untrue.</P>

            <SUBJECT>The claim for classification in Class 3-A.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A claim for classification in Class 3-A must be made by the registrant in writing. Prior to the consideration of the claim, the registrant shall submit supporting documentation, such documents being placed in his file folder.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Basis for classification in Class 3-A.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In Class 3-A shall be placed any registrant:</P>
            <P>(1) Whose induction would result in extreme hardship to his wife when she alone is dependent upon him for support; or</P>
            <P>(2) Whose deferment is advisable because his child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon him for support; or</P>
            <P>(3) Whose deferment is advisable because his wife and child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) are dependent upon him for support.</P>
            <P>(b) In its consideration of a claim by a registrant for classification in Class 3-A, the board will first determine whether the registrant's wife, child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon the registrant for support. Support may be financial assistance, personal care or companionship. If financial assistance is the basis of support, the registrant's contribution must be a substantial portion of the necessities of the dependent. Under most circumstances 40 to 50% of the cost of the necessities may be considered substantial. If that determination is affirmative, the board will determine whether the registrant's induction would result in extreme hardship to his wife when she is the only dependent, or whether the registrant's deferment is advisable because his child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon him for support, or because his wife and his child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) are dependent upon him for support. A deferment is advisable whenever the registrant's induction would result in hardship to his dependents.</P>

            <P>(c) The registrant's classification shall be determined on the basis of the written information in his file, oral <PRTPAGE P="269"/>statements, if made by the registrant at his personal appearance before a board, and oral statements, if made by the registrant's witnesses at his personal appearances.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Ineligibility for Class 3-A.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A registrant is ineligible for Class 3-A when:</P>

            <P>(2) He acquired excessive financial obligations primarily to establish his dependency claim; or</P>

            <P>(4) There are other persons willing and able to assume the support of his dependents; or</P>
            <P>(5) The dependents would suffer only normal anguish of separation from the registrant if he is inducted; or</P>
            <P>(6) The hardship to a dependent is based solely on financial conditions and can be removed by payment and allowances which are payable by the United States to the dependents of persons who are serving in the Armed Forces; or</P>

            <P>(2) The term <E T="03">regular minister of religion</E> means one who as his customary vocation preaches and teaches the principles of religion of a church, a religious sect, or organization of which he is a member, without having been formally ordained as a minister of religion, and who is recognized by such church, sect, or organization as a regular minister.</P>

            <P>(b) If the registrant claims to be a duly ordained minister of religion, the board will:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine whether the registrant has been ordained, in accordance with the ceremonial ritual or discipline of a church, religious sect, or organization established on the basis of a community of faith and belief, doctrines and practices of religious character, to preach and teach the doctrines of such church, sect, or organization and to administer the rites and ceremonies thereof in public worship; and</P>
            <P>(2) Determine whether the registrant as his regular, customary, and bona fide vocation, preaches and teaches the principles of religion and administers the ordinances of public worship, as embodied in the creed or principles of the church, sect, or organization by which the registrant was ordained.</P>
            <P>(c) If the registrant claims to be a regular minister of religion, the board will:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine whether the registrant as his customary and regular calling or customary and regular full-time profession, preaches and teaches the principles of religion of a church, a religious sect, or organization of which he is a member, without having been formally ordained as a minister of religion; and</P>
            <P>(2) Determine whether the registrant is recognized by such church, sect, or organization as a regular minister.</P>
            <P>(d) If the board determines that the registrant is a regular minister of religion or duly ordained minister of religion he shall be classified in Class 4-D.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Evaluation of claim.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In evaluating a claim for classification in Class 4-D, the board will not consider:</P>
            <P>(1) The training or abilities of the registrant for duty as a minister; or</P>
            <P>(2) The motive or sincerity of the registrant in serving as a minister.</P>
            <P>(b) The board should be careful to ascertain the actual duties and functions of registrants seeking classification in Class 4-D, such classification being appropriate only for leaders of the various religious groups, not granted to members of such groups generally.</P>
            <P>(c) Preaching and teaching the principles of one's sect, if performed part-time or half-time, occasionally or irregularly, are insufficient to establish eligiblity for Class 4-D. These activities must be regularly performed and must comprise the registrant's regular calling or full-time profession. The mere fact of some secular employment on the part of a registrant requesting classification in Class 4-D does not in itself make him ineligible for that class.</P>
            <P>(d) The board should request the registrant to furnish any additional information that it believes will be of assistance in the consideration of the registrant's claim for classification in Class 4-D.</P>

            <P>(a) A quorum of the prescribed membership of a board shall be present during all personal appearances. Only those members of the board before whom the registrant appears shall classify him.</P>
            <P>(b) At any such appearance, the registrant may present evidence, including witnesses; discuss his classification; direct attention to any information in his file; and present such further information as he believes will assist the board in determing his proper classification. The information furnished should be as concise as possible.</P>
            <P>(c) The registrant may present the testimony of not more than three witnesses unless it is the judgment of the board that the testimony of additional witnesses is warranted. The registrant may summarize in writing, the oral information that he or his witnesses presented. Such summary shall be placed in the registrant's file.</P>
            <P>(d) A summary will be made of all oral testimony given by the registrant and his witnesses at his personal appearance and such summary shall be placed in the registrant's file.</P>
            <P>(e) If the registrant does not speak English adequately he may appear with a person to act as interpreter for him. The interpreter shall be sworn in accordance with § 1605.81(b). Such interpreter will not be deemed to be a witness unless he testifies in behalf of the registrant.</P>

            <P>(f) During the personal appearance only the registrant or his witnesses may address the board or respond to questions of the board and only the registrant and the board will be allowed to address questions to witnesses. A registrant may, however, be accompanied by an advisor of his choosing and may confer with the advisor before responding to an inquiry or statement by the board: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, those conferences do not substantially interfere with or unreasonably delay the orderly process of the personal appearance.</P>
            <P>(g) If, in the opinion of the board, the informal, administrative nature of the personal appearance is unduly disrupted by the presence of an advisor, the board chairman may require the advisor to leave the hearing room. In such case, the board chairman shall put a statement of reasons for his action in the registrant's file.</P>
            <P>(h) The making of verbatim transcripts, and the using of cameras or other recording devices are prohibited in proceedings before the board. This does not prevent the registrant or Selective Service from making a written summary of all testimony presented.</P>
            <P>(i) Proceedings before the local boards shall be open to the public only upon the request of or with the permission of the registrant. The board chairman may limit the number of persons attending the hearing in order to maintain order. If during the hearing the presence on nonparticipants in the proceeding becomes disruptive, the chairman may close the hearing.</P>

            <P>(1) Has appeared before the board; or</P>

            <P>(a) The local board of jurisdiction shall order any registrant who has been classified in Class 1-O or 1-O-S to perform alternative service at a time and place to be specified by the Director.</P>
            <P>(b) When the local board orders a registrant to perform alternative service, it shall be the duty of the registrant to report for and perform alternative service at the time and place ordered unless the order has been canceled. If the time when the registrant is ordered to report for alternative service is postponed, it shall be the continuing duty of the registrant to report for and perform alternative service at such time and place as he may be reordered. Regardless of the time when or the circumstances under which a registrant fails to report for and perform alternative service when it is his duty to do so, it shall thereafter be his continuing duty from day to day to report for and perform alternative service at the place specified in the order to report for and perform alternative service.</P>
            <P>(c) The Director may authorize a delay of reporting for alternative service for any registrant whose date of induction conflicts with a religious holiday historically observed by a recognized church, religious sect or religious organization of which he is a member. Any registrant so delayed shall report for alternative service on the next business day following the religious holiday.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) Any registrant who is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a high school or similar institution of learning and is issued an order to perform alternative service shall, upon presentation of appropriate facts in the manner prescribed by the Director of Selective Service, have his date to report to perform alternative service postponed:</P>
            <P>(i) Until the time of his graduation therefrom; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Until he attains the twentieth anniversary of his birth; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Until the end of his last academic year, even if he has attained the twentieth anniversary of his birth; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Until he ceases satisfactorily to pursue such course of instruction, whichever is the earliest.</P>
            <P>(2) Any registrant who, while satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university or similar institution of learning, is ordered to perform alternative service shall, upon the presentation of appropriate facts in the manner prescribed by the Director of Selective Service, have his date to report to perform alternative service.</P>
            <P>(i) Until the end of the semester or term, or in the case of his last academic year, the end of the academic year; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Until he ceases to satisfactorily pursue such course of instruction, whichever is the earlier.</P>
            <P>(e) After the order to perform alternative service has been issued, the Director may postpone for a specific time the date when such registrant is required to report in the following circumstances:</P>

            <P>(1) In the case of the death of a member of the registrant's immediate family, extreme emergency involving a member of the registrant's immediate family, serious illness or injury of the registrant, or other emergency beyond the registrant's control. The period of postponement shall not exceed 60 days <PRTPAGE P="280"/>from the date of the order to perform alternative service.

            <P>(f) The Director shall issue to each registrant whose reporting date to perform alternative service is postponed a written notice thereof.</P>
            <P>(g) A postponement of reporting date to perform alternative service shall not render invalid the order to report for alternative service which has been issued to the registrant, but shall operate only to postpone the reporting date, and the registrant shall report on the new date scheduled without having issued to him a new order to report for alternative service.</P>
            <P>(h) Any registrant receiving a postponement under the provisions of this section, shall, after the expiration of such postponement, be rescheduled to report for alternative service at the place to which he was originally ordered.</P>

If the elapsed time from date of placement to the date of Selective Service review exceeds 30 days, the ASW will receive creditable time from the date of placement regardless of the final determination of employer eligibility made by Selective Service.

            <P>(1) The job assignment violates the ASW's religious, moral or ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation in a war that led to his classification as a conscientious objector or violates § 1656.5(a) of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) Review of ASW job assignments will be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.</P>

            <P>(b) Whenever the ASW believes that his job assignment violates his religious, moral or ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation in war that led to his classification as a conscientious objector or is in violation of the provisions of this part he may request <PRTPAGE P="284"/>a reassignment by the ASOM, as provided for in § 1656.12.</P>
            <P>(c) The ASOM shall reassign the ASW if the ASOM concludes that the ASW's work assignment violates his religious, moral or ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation in war which led to his classification as a CO or is in violation of the provisions of this part.</P>

            <P>(e) It shall be the function of the District Appeal Board to determine whether or not an ASW's job assignment violates the ASW's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs of convictions as to participation in war which led to his classification as a conscientious objector or is in violation of the provisions § 1656.5(a) of this part. In making the former determination, the Review Board must be convinced by the ASW that if the ASW performed the job, his convictions as to participation in war would be violated in a similar way as if the ASW had participated in war.</P>
            <P>(f) The District Appeal Board may affirm the assignment or order the reassignment of the ASW in any matter considered by it.</P>

Such requests must include a statement of the nature of the emergency and the expected period of its duration.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Grounds for Postponement.</E> An ASW may, upon presentation of the appropriate facts in his request, be granted a postponement based on one or more of the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) The death of a member of his immediate family;</P>
            <P>(2) An extreme emergency involving a member of his immediate family;</P>
            <P>(3) His serious illness or injury; or</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Basis for Considering Request.</E> The ASW's eligibility for a postponement shall be determined by the office of jurisdiction based upon official documents and other written information contained in his file. Oral statements made by the ASW or made by another person in support of the ASW shall be reduced to writing and placed in the ASW's file.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Duration of Postponement.</E> The initial postponement shall not exceed 60 days from the reporting date in the order.

            <P>(3) It is the responsibility of the ASW promptly to notify in writing the office <PRTPAGE P="285"/>that granted the postponement whenever the basis for which his postponement was granted ceases to exist.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Effect of Postponement.</E> A postponement of the reporting date in an order shall not render the order invalid, but shall only serve to postpone the date on which the ASW is to report. The ASW shall report at the expiration or termination of the postponement.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Religious Holiday.</E> The Director may authorize a delay of reporting under any of the orders specified for an ASW whose date to report conflicts with a religious holiday historically observed by a recognized church, religious sect or religious organization of which he is a member. Any ASW so delayed shall report on the next business day following the religious holiday.</P>

If the local board that ordered the ASW to report for Alternative Service determines he would be entitled to classification in Class 3-A, assuming that the ASW were eligible to file a claim for that class, further compliance with his order shall be suspended for a period not to exceed 365 days, as the local board specifies. Extensions of not more than 365 days each may be granted by the local board so long as the hardship continues until the ASW's liability for training and service under the Military Selective Service Act terminates.</P>
            <P>(b) An ASW may file a request for the suspension of his Order to Perform Alternative Service with the ASO. This request must be in writing, state as clearly as possible the basis for the request, and be signed and dated by the ASW. The ASW must continue working in his assigned job until his request for the suspension of his Order to Perform Alternative Service has been approved.</P>
            <P>(c) Local boards shall follow the procedures established in parts 1642 and 1648 of this chapter to the extent they are applicable in considering a request for the suspension of an Order to Perform Alternative Service.</P>

            <P>(2) The death of a registrant shall be deemed to have occurred while acting under orders issued by or under the authority of the Director of Selective Service if it results directly from an illness or injury suffered by the registrant while so acting and occurs prior to the completion of an emergency medical care, including hospitalization, occasioned by such illness or injury.</P>
            <P>(d) No such claim shall be paid unless it is presented within the period of one year from the date on which the expenses were incurred.</P>
            <P>(e) No such claim shall be allowed in case it is determined that the cause of injury, illness, or death was due to negligence or misconduct of the registrant.</P>
            <P>(f) Burial expenses shall not exceed the maximum prescribed in Section 11 of the Military Selective Service Act in any one case.</P>
            <P>(g) Payment of such claims when allowed shall be made only:</P>
            <P>(1) Directly to the person or facility with which the expenses were incurred; or</P>
            <P>(2) By reimbursement to the registrant, a relative of the registrant, or the legal representative of the registrant's estate, for original payment of such expenses.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1662.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fee schedule; waiver of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> mean those expenditures which the Selective Service System (SSS) actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of the rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
            <P>(2) The term <E T="03">search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. <E T="03">Search</E> should be distinguished from <E T="03">review</E> of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (a)(4) of this section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies may take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and <PRTPAGE P="290"/>otherwise to prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(5) The term <E T="03">‘commercial use’ request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for the use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a request properly belongs in this category the agency must determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover where there is reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the agency may seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
            <P>(6) The term <E T="03">educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(7) The term <E T="03">non-commercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a <E T="03">commercial</E> basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(8) The term <E T="03">representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of <E T="03">freelance</E> journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the agency may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; education and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and other requesters. The FOI Reform Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> A request for documents for commercial use will be assessed charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the record sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. The cost of searching for and reviewing records will be recovered even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records (see paragraph (c)(5) of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> Documents to requesters in this category will be provided for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.<PRTPAGE P="291"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Requesters who are representatives of the news media.</E> Documents will be provided to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> The agency will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Moreover, requests from record subjects for records about themselves filed in the agency's systems of records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment and collection of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Aggregated requests.</E> If the Records Manager reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Records Manager may aggregate any such requests accordingly.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">Fee payment.</E> The Records Manager may assume that a person requesting records pursuant to this part will pay the applicable fees, unless a request includes a limitation on fees to be paid or seeks a waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Unless applicable fees are paid, the agency may use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act (Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage payment.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> (A) The Records Manager may require advance payment of any fee estimated to exceed $250. The Records Manager may also require full payment in advance where a requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion.</P>
            <P>(B) If the Records Manager estimates that the fees will likely exceed $25, he will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Late charges.</E> The Records Manager may assess interest charges when fee payment is not made within 30 days of the date on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C.A.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees</E>—(i) <E T="03">Standards for determining waiver or reduction.</E> The Records Manager shall grant a waiver or reduction of fees chargeable under this section where it is determined that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Selective Service System and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The Records Manager shall also waive fees that are less than the average cost of collecting fees. In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest, the following factors may be considered:</P>
            <P>(A) The relation of the records to the operations or activities of the System;</P>
            <P>(B) The information value of the information to be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(C) Any contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure;</P>
            <P>(D) The significance of that contribution to the public understanding of the subject;</P>
            <P>(E) The nature of the requester's personal interest, if any, in the disclosure requested; and</P>
            <P>(F) Whether the disclosure would be primarily in the requester's commercial interest.</P>

            <P>(ii) Contents of request for waiver. The Records Manager will normally <PRTPAGE P="292"/>deny a request for a waiver of fees that does not include:</P>
            <P>(A) A clear statement of the requester's interest in the requested documents;</P>
            <P>(B) The use proposed for the documents and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use;</P>
            <P>(C) A statement of how the public will benefit from such use and from the release of the requested documents; and</P>
            <P>(D) If specialized use of the documents or information is contemplated, a statement of the requester's qualifications that are relevant to the specialized use.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Burden of proof.</E> In all cases the burden shall be on the requester to present evidence or information in support of a request for a waiver of fees.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Fees for nonproductive search.</E> Fees for record searches and review may be charged even if not responsive documents are located or if the request is denied, particularly if the requester insists upon a search after being informed that it is likely to be nonproductive or that any records found are likely to be exempt from disclosure. The Records Manager shall apply the standards set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section in determining whether to waive or reduce fees.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Rules for determining if an individual is the subject of a record.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Individuals desiring to know if a specific system of records maintained by the Selective Service System (SSS) contains a record pertaining to them should address their inquiries to the Selective Service System, ATTN: <PRTPAGE P="293"/>Records Manager, Public &amp; Intergovernmental Affairs, Arlington, VA 22209-2425. The written inquiry should contain a specific reference to the system of records maintained by Selective Service listed in the SSS Notices of Systems of Records or it should describe the type of record in sufficient detail to reasonably identify the system of records. Notice of SSS Systems of Records subject to the Privacy Act is in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and copies of the notices will be available upon request to the records manager. A compilation of such notices will also be made and published by the Office of Federal Register, in accord with section 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).</P>
            <P>(b) At a minimum, the request should also contain sufficient information to identify the requester in order to allow SSS to determine if there is a record pertaining to that individual in a particular system of records. In instances when the information is insufficient to insure that disclosure will be to the individual to whom the information pertains, in view of the sensitivity of the information, SSS reserves the right to ask the requester for additional identifying information.</P>
            <P>(c) Ordinarily the requester will be informed whether the named system of records contains a record pertaining to the requester within 10 days of receipt of such a request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal federal holidays). Such a response will also contain or reference the procedures which must be followed by the individual making the request in order to gain access to the record.</P>
            <P>(d) Whenever a response cannot be made within the 10 days, the records manager will inform the requester of the reason for the delay and the date by which a response may be anticipated.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for access.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Requirement for written requests. Individuals desiring to gain access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must submit their request in writing in accord with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) below.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Content of the request.</E> (i) The request for access to a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the records manager, at the address cited above, and shall name the system of records or contain a description of such system of records. The request should state that the request is pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. In the absence of specifying solely the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if the request may be processed under both the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act and the request specifies both or neither act, the procedures under the Privacy Act of 1974 will be employed. The individual will be advised that the procedures of the Privacy Act will be utilized, of the existence and the general effect of the Freedom of Information Act, and the difference between procedures under the two acts (e.g. fees, time limits, access). The request should contain necessary information to verify the identity of the requester (see § 1665.2(b)(2)(vi)). In addition, the requester should include any other information which may assist in the rapid identification of the record for which access is being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of employment, etc.) as well as any other identifying information contained in and required by SSS Notice of Systems of Records.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the request for access follows a prior request under § 1665.1, the same identifying information need not be included in the request for access if a reference is made to that prior correspondence, or a copy of the SSS response to that request is attached.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the individual specifically desires a copy of the record, the request should so specify.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">SSS action on request.</E> A request for access will ordinarily be answered within 10 days, except when the records manager determines that access cannot be afforded in that time, in which case the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay and an estimated date by which the request will be answered. Normally access will be granted within 30 days from the date the request was received by the Selective Service System. At a minimum, the answer to the request for access shall include the following:<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) A statement that there is a record as requested or a statement that there is not a record in the system of records maintained by SSS;</P>
            <P>(ii) A statement as to whether access will be granted only by providing copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In the event the requester is unable to meet the specified date and time, alternative arrangements may be made with the official specified in § 1665.2(b)(1);</P>
            <P>(iii) A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will be the sole means of granting access only when the records manager has determined that it would not unduly impede the requester's right of access;</P>
            <P>(iv) The amount of fees charged, if any (see § 1665.6) (Fees are applicable only to requests for copies);</P>
            <P>(v) The name, title, and telephone number of the SSS official having operational control over the record; and</P>
            <P>(vi) The documentation required by SSS to verify the identity of the requester. At a minimum, SSS's verification standards include the following:</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Current or former SSS employees.</E> Current or former SSS employees requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS may, in addition to the other requirements of this section, and at the sole discretion of the official having operational control over the record, have his or her identity verified by visual observation. If the current or former SSS employee cannot be so identified by the official having operational control over the records, identification documentation will be required. Employee identification cards, annuitant identification, drivers licenses, or the <E T="03">employee copy</E> of any official personnel document in the record are examples of acceptable identification validation.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Other than current or former SSS employees.</E> Individuals other than current or former SSS employees requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must produce identification documentation of the type described herein, prior to being granted access. The extent of the identification documentation required will depend on the type of record to be accessed. In most cases, identification verification will be accomplished by the presentation of two forms of identification. Any additional requirements are specified in the system notices published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4).</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Access granted by mail.</E> For records to be accessed by mail, the records manager shall, to the extent possible, establish identity by a comparison of signatures in situations where the data in the record is not so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual to whom they pertain. No identification documentation will be required for the disclosure to the requester of information required to be made available to the public by 5 U.S.C. 552. When in the opinion of the records manager the granting of access through the mail could reasonably be expected to result in harm or embarrassment if disclosed to a person other than the individual to whom the record pertains, a notarized statement of identity or some similar assurance of identity will be required.</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Unavailability of identification documentation.</E> If an individual is unable to produce adequate identification documentation the individual will be required to sign a statement asserting identity and acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to a record about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine of up to $5,000. In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the records sought to be accessed, the official having operational control over the records may require such further reasonable assurances as may be considered appropriate e.g., statements of other individuals who can attest to the identity of the requester. No verification of identity will be required of individuals seeking access to records which are otherwise available to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552, Freedom of Information Act.</P>
            <P>(E) <E T="03">Access by the parent of a minor, or legal guardian.</E> A parent of a minor, upon <E T="03">presenting suitable personal identification,</E> may access on behalf of the minor <E T="03">any record pertaining to the minor</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="295"/>maintained by SSS in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction. <E T="03">Absent a court order or consent,</E> a parent or legal guardian has no absolute right to have access to a record about a child. Minors are not precluded from exercising on their own behalf rights given to them by the Privacy Act.</P>
            <P>(F) <E T="03">Granting access when accompanied by another individual.</E> When an individual requesting access to his or her record in a system of records maintained by SSS wishes to be accompanied by another individual during the course of the examination of the record, the individual making the request shall submit to the official having operational control of the record, a signed statement authorizing that person access to the record.</P>
            <P>(G) <E T="03">Denial of access for inadequate identification documentation.</E> If the official having operational control over the records in a system of records maintained by SSS determines that an individual seeking access has not provided sufficient identification documentation to permit access, the official shall consult with the records manager prior to finally denying the individual access.</P>
            <P>(H) <E T="03">Review of decision to deny access.</E> Whenever the records manager determines, in accordance with the procedures herein, that access cannot be granted the response will also include a statement of the procedures to obtain a review of the decision to deny in accord with § 1665.5.</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (A) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. The mere fact that records in a system of records are frequently the subject of litigation does not bring those systems of records within the scope of this provision. This provision is not intended to preclude access by an individual to the records which are available to that individual under the other processes such as the Freedom of Information Act or the rules of civil procedure.</P>
            <P>(B) Within any system of records pertaining to possible violations of the Military Selective Service Act, the identity of or any information pertaining to any individual who provides information relating to a suspected violator will not be revealed to the suspected violator. This exemption is made under the provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests to amend records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement for written requests.</E> Individuals desiring to amend a record that pertains to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must submit their request in writing in accord with the procedures set forth herein. Records not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 will not be amended in accord with these provisions. However, individuals who believe that such records are inaccurate may bring this to the attention of SSS.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (1)(i) The requests to amend a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the records manager. Included in the request shall be the name of the system and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record in accordance with the provisions concerning access to records as set forth above, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and SSS will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.</P>

            <P>(ii) When the individual's identity has been previously verified pursuant to § 1665.2(b)(2)(vi), further verification of identity is not required as long as the communication does not suggest that a need for verification is present. If the individual's identity has not been previously verified, SSS may require identification validation as described in § 1665.2(b)(2)(vi). Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of a request to amend a record should <PRTPAGE P="296"/>contact the records manager at the address cited above.</P>
            <P>(iii) The exact portion of the record the individual seeks to have amended should be clearly indicated. If possible, the proposed alternative language should also be set forth, or at a minimum, the facts which the individual believes are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete should be set forth with such particularity as to permit SSS not only to understand the individual's basis for the request, but also to make an appropriate amendment to the record.</P>
            <P>(iv) The request must also set forth the reasons why the individual believes his record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. In order to avoid the retention by SSS of personal information merely to permit verification of records, the burden of persuading SSS to amend a record will be upon the individual. The individual must furnish sufficient facts to persuade the official in charge of the system of the inaccuracy, irrelevancy, timeliness or incompleteness of the record.</P>
            <P>(v) Incomplete or inaccurate requests will not be rejected categorically. The individual will be asked to clarify the request as needed.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">SSS action on the request.</E> To the extent possible, a decision, upon a request to amend a record will be made within 10 days, (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays). The response reflecting the decisions upon a request for amendment will include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The decision of the Selective Service System whether to grant in whole, or deny any part of the request to amend the record.</P>
            <P>(ii) The reasons for determination for any portion of the request which is denied.</P>
            <P>(iii) The name and address of the official with whom an appeal of the denial may be lodged.</P>
            <P>(iv) The name and address of the official designated to assist, as necessary and upon request of, the individual making the request in preparation of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(v) A description of the review of the appeal with SSS (see § 1665.5).</P>
            <P>(vi) A description of any other procedures which may be required of the individual in order to process the appeal.</P>
            <P>(3) If the nature of the request for the correction of the system of records precludes a decision within 10 days, the individual making the request will be informed within 10 days of the extended date for a decision. Such a decision will be issued as soon as it is reasonably possible, normally within 30 days from the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) unless unusual circumstances preclude completing action within that time. If the expected completion date for the decision indicated cannot be met, the individual will be advised of the delay of a revised date when the decision may be expected to be completed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Individuals wishing to request a review of the decision by SSS with regard to any initial request to access or amend a record in accord with the provisions of §§ 1665.2 and 1665.4, should submit the request for review in writing and, to the extent possible, include the information specified in § 1665.5(b). Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of their request for review should contact the records manager at the address provided herein.</P>

            <P>(b) The request for review should contain a brief description of the record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from SSS in which the request to access or to amend was denied and also the reasons why the requester believes that access should be granted or the disputed information amended. The request for review should make reference to the information furnished by the individual in support of his claim and the reasons as required by §§ 1665.2 and 1665.4 set forth by SSS in its decision denying access or amendment. Appeals filed without a complete statement by the requester setting forth the reasons for review will, of course, be processed. However, in order to make the appellate process as meaningful as possible, the requester's disagreement should be set forth in an understandable manner. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of personal information, SSS reserves the <PRTPAGE P="297"/>right to dispose of the material concerning the request to access or amend a record if no request for review in accord with this section is received by SSS within 180 days of the mailing by SSS of its decision upon an initial request. A request for review received after the 180 day period may, at the discretion of the records manager, be treated as an initial request to access or amend a record.</P>
            <P>(c) The request for review should be addressed to the Director of Selective Service.</P>

            <P>(d) The Director of Selective Service will inform the requester in writing of the decision on the request for review within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal federal holidays) from the date of receipt by SSS of the individual's request for review unless the Director extends the 20 days period for good cause. The extension and the reasons therefor will be sent by SSS to the requester within the initial 20 day period. Such extensions should not be routine and should not normally exceed an additional thirty days. If the decision does not grant in full the request for amendment, the notice of the decision will provide a description of the steps the individual may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision, a statement that the individual may file a concise statement with SSS setting forth the individual's reasons for his disagreement with the decision and the procedures for filing such a statement of disagreement. The Director of Selective Service has the authority to determine the <E T="03">conciseness</E> of the statement, taking into account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. Upon the filing of a proper, concise statement by the individual, any subsequent disclosure of the information in dispute will be clearly noted so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent, a copy of the concise statement furnished and a concise statement by SSS setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if SSS chooses to file such a statement. A notation of a dispute is required to be made only if an individual informs the agency of his disagreement with SSS's determination in accord with § 1665.5(a), (b) and (c). A copy of the individual's statement, and if it chooses, SSS's statement will be sent to any prior transferee of the disputed information who is listed on the accounting required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). If the reviewing official determines that the record should be amended in accord with the individual's request, SSS will promptly correct the record, advise the individual, and inform previous recipients if an accounting of the disclosure was made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). The notification of correction pertains to information actually disclosed.</P>

            <P>(a) This regulation provides procedures for the collection by administrative offset of a federal employee's salary without his/her consent to satisfy certain debts owed to the federal government. These regulations apply to all federal employees who owe debts to the Selective Service System and to current employees of the Selective Service System who owe debts to other federal agencies. This regulation does not apply when the employee consents to recovery from his/her current pay account.</P>
            <P>(b) This regulation does not apply to debts or claims arising under:</P>

            <P>(1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.;</E>

            </P>
            <P>(3) The tariff laws of the United States; or</P>
            <P>(4) Any case where a collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).</P>

            <P>(c) This regulation does not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's selection of coverage or a change in coverage under a federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
            </P>

            <P>(d) This regulation does not preclude the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection action where appropriate under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act 31 U.S.C. 3711 <E T="03">et seq.</E> 4 CFR parts 101 through 105 and 45 CFR part 1177.</P>
            <P>(e) This regulation does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774 or 32 U.S.C. 716 or in any way questioning the amount or validity of the debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office. This regulation does not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions applicable to the particular debt being collected.</P>

            <P>(f) Matters not addressed in these regulations should be reviewed in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards at 4 CFR 101.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

            <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1699.150, no qualified handicapped persons shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subject to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1699.150</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
            <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1699.150(a) would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making <PRTPAGE P="307"/>its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4141 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, at the time, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(4) Indicate the officials responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

            <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handcapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 14-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Communications.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aid where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
            <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>

            <P>(c) The agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. <PRTPAGE P="308"/>The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1699.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures established in 29 CFR part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).</P>
            <P>(c) Responsibility for implementation and operation of this section shall be vested in the Associate Director for Administration.</P>
            <P>(d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may extend this time period for good cause.</P>
            <P>(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>
            <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible and usable to handicapped persons.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preliminary information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Members of the public shall address all communications to the point of contact specified in § 1700.3 and clearly delineate the communication as a request under the FOIA. ODNI staff who receive a FOIA request shall expeditiously forward the request to the Director, Information Management Office (IMO). Requests and appeals (as well as referrals and consultations) received from FOIA requesters who owe outstanding fees for information services at this or other federal agencies will not be accepted and action on all pending requests shall be terminated in such circumstances.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1700.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requirements as to form and content.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Required information.</E> No particular form is required. A request must reasonably describe the record or records being sought and be submitted in accordance with this regulation. Documents must be described sufficiently to enable a staff member familiar with the subject to locate the documents with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and the subject matter of the record. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the records or type of records <PRTPAGE P="313"/>that you want, the more likely it will be that the IMO will be able to locate records responsive to your request. The IMO will provide you an opportunity to discuss your request with it so that you may modify your request to meet the requirements of this section. If after having been asked to do so you do not provide the IMO with information sufficient to enable it to locate responsive records your request will be closed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional information for fee determination.</E> A requester must provide sufficient personally identifying information to allow staff to determine the appropriate fee category and to contact the requester easily.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1700.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fees for records services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Search, review, and reproduction fees will be charged in accordance with the provisions below relating to schedule, limitations, and category of requester. Applicable fees will be due even if a subsequent search locates no responsive records or some or all of the responsive records must be denied under one or more of the exemptions of the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fee waiver requests.</E> Records will be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate when ODNI determines:</P>

            <P>(1) As a matter of administrative discretion, the interest of the United States Government would be served, <E T="03">or</E>
            </P>

            <P>(2) It is in the public interest to provide responsive records because the disclosure is likely to contribute <E T="03">significantly</E> to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the United States Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee waiver appeals.</E> Denials of requests for fee waivers or reductions may be appealed to the Director of the Intelligence Staff, or his functional equivalent, through the ODNI Chief FOIA Officer. A requester is encouraged to provide any explanation or argument as to how his or her request satisfies the requirements of this regulation and the Act. See § 1700.14 for further details on appeals.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for fee waiver requests and appeals.</E> Appeals should be resolved prior to the initiation of processing and the incurring of costs. However, fee waiver requests will be accepted at any time prior to an agency decision regarding the request, except when processing has been initiated, in which case the requester must agree to be responsible for costs in the event of an adverse administrative or judicial decision.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> If you make a FOIA request, it shall be considered a firm commitment by you to pay all applicable fees chargeable under this regulation, up to and including the amount of $25.00, unless you ask for a waiver of fees. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> The ODNI may require an advance payment of up to 100 percent of the estimated fees when projected fees exceed $250.00, not including charges associated with the first 100 pages of production and two hours of search (when applicable), or when the requester previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, for fees of any amount. ODNI will hold in abeyance for 45 days those requests where advance payment has been requested.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Schedule of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The schedule of fees for services performed in responding to requests for records is as follows:</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Application of schedule.</E> Personnel search time includes time expended in manual paper records searches, indices searches, review of computer search results for relevance, and personal computer system searches. In any event where the actual cost to ODNI of a particular item is less than the above schedule (e.g., a large production run of a document resulting in a cost less than $5.00 per hundred pages), then the actual lesser cost will be charged.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other services.</E> For all other types of output, production, or reproduction (e.g., photographs, maps, or published reports), ODNI will charge actual cost or amounts authorized by statute. Determinations of actual cost shall include the commercial cost of the media, the personnel time expended in making the item to be released, and an allocated cost of the equipment used in making the item, or, if the production is effected by a commercial service, then that charge shall be deemed the actual cost for purposes of this regulation.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Limitations on collection of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> No fees will be charged if the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than the fee itself. That cost includes the administrative costs to ODNI of billing, receiving, recording, and processing the fee for deposit to the Treasury Department and, as of the date of these regulations, is deemed to be $10.00.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Fee categories.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters for fee purposes: Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters, representatives of the news media requesters, and all other requesters. The categories are defined in § 1700.2 and applicable fees will be assessed as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Commercial use requesters: Charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating responsive records (if any);</P>
            <P>(2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters, and representatives of the news media requesters: Only charges for reproduction beyond the first 100 pages;</P>
            <P>(3) All other requesters: Charges which recover the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing responsive records (if any) beyond the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time which will be furnished without charge.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Associated requests.</E> If it appears a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert have requested portions of an apparently unitary request for the purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees, ODNI may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. Requests from multiple requesters will not be aggregated without clear evidence. ODNI will not aggregate multiple unrelated requests.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Requests meeting the requirements of § 1700.3 through § 1700.6 shall be accepted as formal requests and processed under the FOIA and this <PRTPAGE P="315"/>Part. A request will not be considered received until it reaches the IMO. Ordinarily upon its receipt a request will be date-stamped as received. It is this date that establishes when your request is received for administrative purposes, not any earlier date such as the date of the letter or its postmark date. For the quickest possible handling, both the request letter and the envelope should be marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Electronic Reading Room.</E> ODNI maintains an online FOIA Reading Room on the ODNI Web site which contains the information that the FOIA requires be routinely made available for public inspection and copying as well as other information determined to be of general public interest.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Confirming the existence of certain documents.</E> In processing a request, ODNI shall decline to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12,958 and its amending orders, reveals intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 403-1(i)(1), or would be an invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. In such circumstances, ODNI, in its final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> Whenever the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component determines to extend the time limits on that basis, ODNI will inform the requester in writing and advise the requester of the right to narrow the scope of his or her request or agree to an alternative timeframe for processing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> ODNI may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, including through limits based on the number of pages involved. ODNI may provide requesters in its slower track with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of its faster track.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Action on the request.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial action for access.</E> ODNI staff identified to search for records pursuant to a FOIA request shall search all relevant record systems within their cognizance as of the date the search is commenced. A staff member tasked to conduct a search shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine whether records exist;</P>
            <P>(2) Determine whether and to what extent any FOIA exemptions apply;</P>
            <P>(3) Make recommendations for withholding records or portions of records that originated in the staff member's organization and for which there is a legal basis for denial or make a recommendation in accordance with § 1700.7(c). In making recommendations, ODNI staff shall be guided by the procedures specified in § 1700.10 regarding confidential commercial information and § 1700.11 regarding third party information; and</P>
            <P>(4) Forward to the Director, IMO, all records responsive to the request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Referrals and consultations.</E> ODNI records containing information originated by other ODNI components shall be forwarded to those entities for action in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and returned. Records originated by other federal agencies or ODNI records containing other federal agency information shall be forwarded to such agencies for processing and direct response to the requester or for consultation and return to the ODNI. ODNI will notify the requester if it makes a referral for direct response.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Release of information.</E> When the Director, IMO (or Appeals Authority) makes a final determination to release records, the records will be forwarded to the requester in an appropriate format promptly upon compliance with any preliminary procedural requirements, including payment of fees. If any portion of a record is withheld initially or upon appeal, the Director, IMO (or Appeals Authority) will provide a written response that shall include, at a minimum:</P>

            <P>(1) The basis for the withholding, citing the specific statutory exemption or exemptions invoked under the FOIA with respect to each portion withheld, <PRTPAGE P="316"/>unless documents are withheld in accordance with § 1700.7(c);</P>
            <P>(2) When the withholding is based in whole or in part on a security classification, the explanation shall include a determination that the record meets the cited criteria and rationale of the governing Executive Order;</P>
            <P>(3) When the denial is based on 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), the statute relied upon; and</P>
            <P>(4) Notice to the requester of the right to judicial review.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees in general.</E> Fees collected under this part do not accrue to ODNI and shall be deposited immediately to the general account of the United States Treasury.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification of decision.</E> Upon completion of all required review and the receipt of accrued fees (or promise to pay such fees), ODNI will promptly inform the requester in writing of those records or portions of records that will be released and those that will be denied.</P>
            <P>(1) For documents to be released, ODNI will provide paper copies or documents on electronic media, if requested and available;</P>
            <P>(2) For documents not released or partially released, ODNI shall explain the reasons for any denial and give notice of a right of administrative appeal. For partial releases, redactions will be made to ensure requesters can see the placement and general length of redactions with the applicable exemption or exemptions clearly with respect to each redaction.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for business information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Business information obtained by ODNI from a submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a FOIA request except in accordance with this section. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Business information</E> means commercial or financial information in which a legal entity has a recognized property interest;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means such business information provided to the United States Government by a submitter which is reasonably believed to contain information exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; and</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information to the United States Government; it includes, but is not limited to, corporations, businesses (however organized), State governments, and foreign governments.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> A submitter of business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be confidential commercial information and hence protected from required disclosure pursuant to Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Such designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Process in event of FOIA request</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> ODNI shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of a FOIA request encompassing business information whenever:</P>
            <P>(i) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as confidential commercial information, or</P>
            <P>(ii) ODNI staff believe that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, and</P>
            <P>(iii) The information was submitted within the last 10 years unless the submitter requested and provided acceptable justification for a specific notice period of greater duration.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of notice.</E> Communication to a submitter of commercial information shall either describe the exact nature of the confidential commercial information at issue or provide copies of the responsive records containing such information.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Response by submitter.</E> (i) Within seven days of the notice described in <PRTPAGE P="317"/>paragraph (c)(1), all claims of confidentiality by a submitter must be supported by a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Affirm that the information has not been disclosed to the public;</P>
            <P>(B) Explain why the information is a trade secret or confidential commercial information;</P>
            <P>(C) Explain in detail how disclosure of the information will result in substantial competitive harm;</P>
            <P>(D) Affirm that the submitter will provide ODNI and the Department of Justice with such litigation support as requested; and</P>
            <P>(E) Be certified by an officer authorized to legally bind the submitter.</P>
            <P>(ii) It should be noted that information provided by a submitter pursuant to this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Decision and notice of intent to disclose.</E> (i) ODNI shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to its final determination. If the Director, IMO, decides to disclose a document over the objection of a submitter, ODNI shall provide the submitter a written notice that shall include:</P>
            <P>(A) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;</P>
            <P>(B) A description of the information to be disclosed; and</P>
            <P>(C) A specified disclosure date that is seven days after the date of the instant notice.</P>
            <P>(ii) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the ODNI shall also notify the requester and, if the ODNI notifies a submitter that it intends to disclose information, then the requester shall be notified also and given the proposed date for disclosure.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> If a requester initiates legal action seeking to compel disclosure of information asserted to be within the scope of this section, ODNI shall promptly notify the submitter. The submitter, as specified above, shall provide such litigation assistance as required by ODNI and the Department of Justice.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirement.</E> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if ODNI determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) The information should not be disclosed, pursuant to Exemption 4 and/or any other exemption of the FOIA;</P>
            <P>(ii) The information has been published lawfully or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(iii) The disclosure of the information is otherwise required by law or federal regulation; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The designation made by the submitter under this section appears frivolous, except that, in such a case, the ODNI will, within a reasonable time prior to the specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for information concerning other persons.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Personal information concerning individuals other than the requester shall not be disclosed under the FOIA if the proposed release would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or, if the information was compiled for law enforcement purposes, it could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. <E T="03">See</E> 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>(1) Personal information means any information about an individual that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that arise from Government possession of such information.</P>
            <P>(2) Public interest means the public interest in understanding the operations and activities of the United States Government and not simply any matter that might be of general interest to the requester or members of the public.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination to be made.</E> In making the required determination under this section and pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) of the FOIA, ODNI will balance the privacy interests that would be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested information.<PRTPAGE P="318"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Otherwise.</E> A requester seeking information on a third party is encouraged to provide a signed affidavit or declaration from the third party consenting to disclosure of the information. However, any such statements shall be narrowly construed and the Director, IMO, in the exercise of that officer's discretion and administrative authority, may seek clarification from the third party prior to any or all releases.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> All requests will be handled in the order received on a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis. Exceptions to this rule will only be made in accordance with the following procedures.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. Within ten calendar days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, the IMO shall decide whether to grant it and shall notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority and shall be processed as soon as practicable.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination to be made:</E> Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited processing treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
            <P>(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(2) An urgency to inform the public concerning an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Right to appeal and appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Right to appeal.</E> Individuals who disagree with a decision not to produce a document or parts of a document, to deny a fee category request, to deny a request for a fee waiver or fee reduction, to deny expedited processing, or a decision regarding a fee estimate or a determination that no records exist, should submit a written request for review to the Chief FOIA Officer c/o Director, Information Management Office, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Washington, DC 20511. The words “FOIA APPEAL” should be written on the letter and the envelope. The appeal must be signed by the individual or his legal counsel.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements as to time and form.</E> Appeals of adverse decisions must be received within 45 days of the date of the ODNI's initial decision. Requesters should include a statement of the reasons supporting the request for reversal of the initial decision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in question has been the subject of an administrative review within the previous two years or is the subject of pending litigation in the Federal courts.</P>

            <P>(a) The Director of the Intelligence Staff, after consultation with any ODNI component organization involved in the initial decision as well as with the Office of General Counsel, will make a final determination on the appeal. Appeals of denials of requests for expedited processing shall be acted on expeditiously.</P>
            <P>(b) The Director, IMO, will ordinarily be the initial deciding official on FOIA requests to the ODNI. However, in the event the Director of the Intelligence Staff makes an initial decision that is later appealed, the Principal Deputy Director for National Intelligence will decide the appeal in accordance with the procedures in this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">How to request.</E> Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (see paragraph (b) of this section), record subjects (or their guardians or representatives) may request an accounting of disclosures that have been made to another person, organization, or agency as permitted by the Privacy Act at 5 U.S.C. 552a(b).

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tasking to component.</E> Upon receipt of a proper access request, the D/IMO shall provide a copy of the request to the point of contact (POC) in the ODNI component with which the records sought reside. The POC within the component shall determine whether responsive records exist and, if so, recommend to the D/IMO:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether access should be denied in whole or part (and the legal basis for denial under the Privacy Act); or</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Coordination and referrals</E>—(1) <E T="03">Examination of records.</E> If a component POC receiving a request for access determines that an originating agency or other agency that has a substantial interest in the record is best able to process the request (e.g., the record is governed by another agency's regulation, or another agency originally generated or classified the record), the POC shall forward to the D/IMO all records necessary for coordination with or referral to the other component or agency, as well as specific recommendations with respect to any denials.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> Whenever the D/IMO refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, the D/IMO shall notify the requester of the referral.</P>

              <P>(A) May reveal protected intelligence sources and collection methods (50 U.S.C. 403-1(i)); or</P>
              <P>(B) Is classified and subject to an exemption appropriately invoked by ODNI or another agency under subsections (j) or (k) of the Privacy Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) In such event, the ODNI will inform the requester in writing and advise the requestor of the right to file an administrative appeal of any adverse determination.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> The D/IMO shall respond to a request for access promptly upon receipt of recommendations from the POC and determinations resulting from any necessary coordination with or referral to another agency. The D/IMO may determine to update a requester on the status of a request that remains outstanding longer than reasonably expected.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">ODNI action on requests for access</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grant of access.</E> Once the D/IMO determines to grant a request for access in whole or in part, the D/IMO shall notify the requester in writing and come to agreement with the requester about how to effect access, whether by on-site review or duplication of the records. If a requester is accompanied by another person, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Denial of access.</E> The D/IMO shall notify the requester in writing when an adverse determination is made denying a request for access in any respect. Adverse determinations, or denials, consist of a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; or a determination that the existence of a record can neither be confirmed nor denied. The notification letter shall state:</P>
              <P>(i) The reason(s) for the denial; and</P>

              <P>(a) Individuals may appeal denials of requests for access, amendment, or accounting by submitting a written request for review to the Director, Information Management Office (D/IMO) at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Washington, DC 20511. The words “PRIVACY ACT APPEAL” should be written on the letter and the envelope. The appeal must be signed by the record subject or legal representative. No personal appearance or hearing on appeal will be allowed.</P>
              <P>(b) The D/IMO must receive the appeal letter within 45 calendar days of the date the requester received the notice of denial. The postmark is conclusive as to timeliness. Copies of correspondence from ODNI denying the request to access or amend the record should be included with the appeal, if possible. At a minimum, the appeal letter should identify:</P>
              <P>(1) The records involved;</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the initial request for access to or amendment of the record;</P>
              <P>(3) The date of ODNI's denial of that request; and</P>
              <P>(4) A statement of the reasons supporting the request for reversal of the initial decision. The statement should focus on information not previously available or legal arguments demonstrating that the ODNI's decision is improper.</P>

              <P>(c) Following receipt of the appeal, the Director of Intelligence Staff (DIS) shall, in consultation with the Office of <PRTPAGE P="326"/>General Counsel, make a final determination in writing on the appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) Where ODNI reverses an initial denial, the following procedures apply:</P>
              <P>(1) If ODNI reverses an initial denial of access, the procedures in paragraph (e)(1) of § 1701.10 of this subpart will apply.</P>
              <P>(2) If ODNI reverses its initial denial of a request to amend a record, the POC will ensure that the record is corrected as requested, and the D/IMO will inform the individual of the correction, as well as all persons, organizations and agencies to which ODNI had disclosed the record.</P>
              <P>(3) If ODNI reverses its initial denial of a request for accounting, the POC will notify the requester when the accounting is available for on-site review or transmission in paper or electronic medium.</P>

              <P>(e) If ODNI upholds its initial denial or reverses in part (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, only partially granting the request), ODNI's notice of final agency action will inform the requester of the following rights:</P>
              <P>(1) Judicial review of the denial under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1), as limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5).</P>
              <P>(2) Opportunity to file a statement of disagreement with the denial, citing the reasons for disagreeing with ODNI's final determination not to correct or amend a record. The requester's statement of disagreement should explain why he disputes the accuracy of the record.</P>
              <P>(3) Inclusion in one's record of copies of the statement of disagreement and the final denial, which ODNI will provide to all subsequent recipients of the disputed record, as well as to all previous recipients of the record where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1701.20</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Exemption policies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The DNI has determined that invoking exemptions under the Privacy Act and continuing exemptions previously asserted by agencies whose records ODNI receives is necessary: to ensure against the release of classified information essential to the national defense or foreign relations; to protect intelligence sources and methods; and to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of intelligence, investigative and law enforcement processes. Accordingly, as authorized by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, subsections (j) and (k), and in accordance with the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, the ODNI shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Exercise its authority pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act to exempt certain ODNI systems of records or portions of systems of records from various provisions of the Privacy Act; and</P>
              <P>(2) Continue in effect and assert all exemptions claimed under Privacy Act subsections (j) and (k) by an originating agency from which the ODNI obtains records where the purposes underlying the original exemption remain valid and necessary to protect the contents of the record.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Related policies.</E> (1) The exemptions asserted apply to records only to the extent they meet the criteria of subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act, whether claimed by the ODNI or the originator of the records.</P>

              <P>(2) Discretion to supersede exemption: Where complying with a request for access or amendment would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect a counterterrorism or law enforcement interest, and unless prohibited by law, the D/IMO may exercise his discretion to waive the exemption. Discretionary waiver of an exemption with respect to a record will not obligate the ODNI to waive the exemption with respect to any other record in an exempted system of records. As a condition of such discretionary access, ODNI may impose any restrictions (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, concerning the location of file reviews) deemed necessary or advisable to protect the security of agency operations, information, personnel, or facilities.</P>
              <P>(3) Records in ODNI systems also are subject to protection under 50 U.S.C. 403-1(i), the provision of the National Security Act of 1947 which requires the DNI to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1701.21</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Exemption of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) systems of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) ODNI exempts the systems of records listed in § 1701.22 from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3); (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4); (e)(1) and (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to paragraph (k)(1), (k)(2), or (k)(5) of the Act as noted in § 1701.22. ODNI also derivatively preserves the exempt status of records it receives from source agencies when the reason for the exemption remains valid, as set forth in § 1701.20.</P>
              <P>(b) Systems of records utilized by the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) are additionally exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(4); (e)(2); (e)(3); (e)(5); (e)(8); (e)(12); and (g) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).</P>
              <P>(c) Exemption of records in these systems from any or all of the enumerated requirements may be necessary for the following reasons:</P>

              <P>(1) From paragraph (c)(3) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (accounting of disclosures) because an accounting of disclosures from records concerning the record subject would specifically reveal an intelligence or investigative interest on the part of ODNI or the recipient agency and could result in release of properly classified national security or foreign policy information.<PRTPAGE P="328"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) From paragraph (c)(4) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (notice of amendment to record recipients) because the system is exempted from the access and amendment provisions of paragraph (d) of the Privacy Act.</P>
              <P>(3) From paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (record subject's right to access and amend records) because affording access and amendment rights could alert the record subject to the investigative interest of intelligence or law enforcement agencies or compromise sensitive information classified in the interest of national security. In the absence of a national security basis for exemption, records in this system may be exempted from access and amendment to the extent necessary to honor promises of confidentiality to persons providing information concerning a candidate for position. Inability to maintain such confidentiality would restrict the free flow of information vital to a determination of a candidate's qualifications and suitability.</P>
              <P>(4) From paragraph (e)(1) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (maintain only relevant and necessary records) because it is not always possible to establish relevance and necessity before all information is considered and evaluated in relation to an intelligence concern. In the absence of a national security basis for exemption under paragraph (k)(1) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), records in this system may be exempted from the relevance requirement pursuant to paragraphs (k)(2) and (5) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) because it is not possible to determine in advance what exact information may assist in determining the qualifications and suitability of a candidate for position. Seemingly irrelevant details, when combined with other data, can provide a useful composite for determining whether a candidate should be appointed.</P>
              <P>(5) From paragraph (e)(2) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (collection directly from the individual) because application of this provision would alert the subject of a counterterrorism investigation, study, or analysis to that fact, permitting the subject to frustrate or impede the activity. Counterterrorism investigations necessarily rely on information obtained from third parties rather than information furnished by subjects themselves.</P>
              <P>(6) From paragraph (e)(3) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (provide Privacy Act Statement to subjects furnishing information) because the system is exempted from requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of the Privacy Act to collect information directly from the subject.</P>
              <P>(7) From paragraphs (e)(4)(G) and (H) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (publication of procedures for notifying subjects of the existence of records about them and how they may access records and contest contents) because the system is exempted from provisions in paragraph (d) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) regarding access and amendment, and from the requirement in paragraph (f) of the Privacy Act to promulgate agency rules for notification, access, and amendment. Nevertheless, ODNI has published notice concerning notification, access, and contest procedures because it may in certain circumstances determine it appropriate to provide subjects access to all or a portion of the records about them in a system of records.</P>
              <P>(8) From paragraph (e)(4)(I) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (identifying sources of records in the system of records) because identifying sources could result in disclosure of properly classified national defense or foreign policy information, intelligence sources and methods, and investigatory techniques and procedures. Notwithstanding its exemption from this requirement, ODNI identifies record sources in broad categories sufficient to provide general notice of the origins of the information it maintains in its systems of records.</P>

              <P>(9) From paragraph (e)(5) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (maintain timely, accurate, complete and up-to-date records) because many of the records in the system are derived from other domestic and foreign agency record systems over which ODNI exercises no control. In addition, in collecting information for counterterrorism, intelligence, and law enforcement purposes, it is not possible to determine in advance what information <PRTPAGE P="329"/>is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time and the development of additional facts and circumstances, seemingly irrelevant or dated information may acquire significance. The restrictions imposed by paragraph (e)(5) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) would limit the ability of intelligence analysts to exercise judgment in conducting investigations and impede development of intelligence necessary for effective counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts.</P>
              <P>(10) From paragraph (e)(8) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (notice of compelled disclosures) because requiring individual notice of legally compelled disclosure poses an impossible administrative burden and could alert subjects of counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence investigations to the previously unknown fact of those investigations.</P>

              <P>(11) From paragraph (e)(12) of the Privacy Act (public notice of matching activity) because, to the extent such activities are not otherwise excluded from the matching requirements of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), publishing advance notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> would frustrate the ability of intelligence analysts to act quickly in furtherance of analytical efforts.</P>
              <P>(12) From paragraph (f) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (agency rules for notifying subjects to the existence of records about them, for accessing and amending records, and for assessing fees) because the system is exempt from provisions in paragraph (d) of the Privacy Act regarding access and amendment of records by record subjects. Nevertheless, ODNI has published agency rules concerning notification of a subject in response to his request if any system of records named by the subject contains a record pertaining to him and procedures by which the subject may access or amend the records. Notwithstanding exemption, ODNI may determine it appropriate to satisfy a record subject's access request.</P>
              <P>(13) From paragraph (g) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) (civil remedies) to the extent that the civil remedies relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which this rule exempts the system.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1703.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Procedure for production.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Whenever a demand is made for ODNI information or material, the employee who received the demand shall immediately notify OGC ((703) 275-2527). The OGC and the ODNI employee shall then follow the procedures set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) The OGC may assert any and all defenses before any search for potentially responsive ODNI information or material begins. Further, in its sole discretion the ODNI may decline to begin a search for potentially responsive ODNI information or material until a final and non-appealable disposition of any or all of the asserted defenses is made by the federal, state, local or government entity of competent jurisdiction. When the OGC determines that it is appropriate to search for potentially responsive ODNI information and material, the OGC will forward the demand to the appropriate ODNI offices or entities with responsibility for the ODNI information or material sought in the demand. Those ODNI offices or entities shall then search for and provide to the OGC all potentially responsive ODNI information and material. The OGC may then assert any and all defenses to the production of what it determines is responsive ODNI information or material.</P>
            <P>(c) In reaching a decision on whether to produce responsive ODNI information or material, or to object to the demand, the OGC shall consider whether:</P>
            <P>(1) Any relevant privileges are applicable;</P>
            <P>(2) The applicable rules of discovery or procedure require production;</P>
            <P>(3) Production would violate a statute, regulation, executive order or other provision of law;</P>

            <P>(4) Production would violate a non-disclosure agreement;<PRTPAGE P="336"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) Production would be inconsistent with the DNI's responsibility to protect intelligence sources and methods, or reveal classified information or state secrets;</P>
            <P>(6) Production would violate a specific ODNI policy issuance or instruction; and</P>
            <P>(7) Production would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of ODNI functions.</P>
            <P>(d) If oral or written testimony is sought by a demand in a case or matter in which the ODNI is not a party, a reasonably detailed description of the testimony sought in the form of an affidavit, or a written statement if that is not feasible, by the party seeking the testimony or its attorney must be furnished to the OGC.</P>
            <P>(e) The OGC shall notify the appropriate employees of all decisions regarding responses to demands and provide advice and counsel for the implementation of the decisions.</P>

            <P>(f) If response to a demand is required before a decision is made whether to provide responsive ODNI information or material, an OGC attorney will request that a Department of Justice attorney appear with the ODNI employee upon whom that demand has been made before the court or other competent authority and provide it with a copy of this regulation and inform the court or other authority as to the status of the demand. The court will be requested to stay the demand pending resolution by the ODNI. If the request for a stay is denied or there is a ruling that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions rendered in accordance with this Part, the employee upon whom the demand was made shall, if directed to do so by the General Counsel or its designee, respectfully decline to comply with the demand under the authority of <E T="03">United States ex rel.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any search, review, and reproduction fees will be charged in accordance with the provisions below relating to schedule, limitations, and category of requester. Applicable fees will be due even if a subsequent search locates no responsive records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency discretion to waive fees.</E> Records will be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate when ODNI determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) As a matter of administrative discretion, the interest of the United States Government would be served, or</P>
            <P>(2) It is in the public interest to provide responsive records because the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the United States Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> If you request an MDR, it shall be considered a firm commitment by you to pay all applicable fees chargeable under this regulation, up to and including the amount of $25.00.

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> The ODNI may require an advance payment of up to 100 percent of the estimated fees when projected fees exceed $250.00, not including charges associated with the first 100 pages of production and two hours of search (when applicable), or when the requester previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, for fees of any amount. ODNI will hold in abeyance for 45 days those requests where advance payment has been requested.</P>

In any event in which the actual cost to ODNI of a particular item is less than the above schedule (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a large production run of a document resulting in a cost less than $5.00 per hundred pages), then the actual lesser cost will be charged.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other services.</E> For all other types of output, production, or reproduction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> photographs, maps, or published reports), ODNI will charge actual cost or amounts authorized by statute. Determinations of actual cost shall include the commercial cost of the media, the personnel time expended in making the item to be released, and an allocated cost of the equipment used in making the item, or, if the production is effected by a commercial service, then that charge shall be deemed the actual cost for purposes of this regulation.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations on collection of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> No fees will be charged if the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than the fee itself.

Requests from multiple requesters will not be aggregated without clear evidence. ODNI will not aggregate multiple unrelated requests.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Required determinations:</E> These parties shall respond in writing to the D/IMD with a finding as to the classified status of the information, including the category of protected information as set forth in section 1.4 of the Order, and if older than ten years, the basis for the extension of classification time under sections 1.5 and 3.3 of the Order.

              <SUBJECT>Preliminary information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Members of the public shall address all communications to the NACIC Coordinator as specified at § 1800.03 and clearly delineate the communication as a request under the Freedom of Information Act and this regulation. NACIC employees receiving a communication in the nature of a FOIA request shall expeditiously forward same to the Coordinator. Requests and appeals on requests, referrals, or coordinations received from members of the public who owe outstanding fees for information services at this or other federal agencies will not be accepted and action on all pending requests shall be terminated in such circumstances.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1800.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Requirements as to form and content.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Required information.</E> No particular form is required. A request need only reasonably describe the records of interest. This means that documents must be described sufficiently to enable a professional employee familiar with the subject to locate the documents with a reasonable effort. Commonly this equates to a requirement that the documents must be locatable through the indexing of our various systems. Extremely broad or vague requests or requests requiring research do not satisfy this requirement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional information for fee determination.</E> In addition, a requester should provide sufficient personal identifying information to allow us to determine the appropriate fee category. A requester should also provide an agreement to pay all applicable fees or fees not to exceed a certain amount or request a fee waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Otherwise.</E> Communications which do not meet these requirements will be considered an expression of interest and NACIC will work with, and offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to define a request properly.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1800.13</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Fees for record services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Search, review, and reproduction fees will be charged in accordance with the provisions below relating to schedule, limitations, and category of requester. Applicable fees will be due even if our search locates no responsive records or some or all of the responsive records must be denied under one or more of the exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act.<PRTPAGE P="346"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fee waiver requests.</E> Records will be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate whenever NACIC determines:</P>
              <P>(1) That, as a matter of administrative discretion, the interest of the United States Government would be served, or</P>
              <P>(2) That it is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the United States Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; NACIC shall consider the following factors when making this determination:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the subject of the request concerns the operations or activities of the United States Government; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute to an understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents will contribute to public understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of United States Government operations and activities; and</P>
              <P>(v) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(vi) Whether the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee waiver appeals.</E> Denials of requests for fee waivers or reductions may be appealed to the Director, NACIC via the Coordinator. A requester is encouraged to provide any explanation or argument as to how his or her request satisfies the statutory requirement set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for fee waiver requests and appeals.</E> It is suggested that such requests and appeals be made and resolved prior to the initiation of processing and the incurring of costs. However, fee waiver requests will be accepted at any time prior to the release of documents or the completion of a case, and fee waiver appeals within forty-five (45) days of our initial decision subject to the following condition: if processing has been initiated, then the requester must agree to be responsible for costs in the event of an adverse administrative or judicial decision.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> In order to protect requesters from large and/or unanticipated charges, NACIC will request specific commitment when it estimates that fees will exceed $100.00. NACIC will hold in abeyance for forty-five (45) days requests requiring such agreement and will thereafter deem the request closed. This action, of course, would not prevent an individual from refiling his or her FOIA request with a fee commitment at a subsequent date.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Deposits.</E> NACIC may require an advance deposit of up to 100 percent of the estimated fees when fees may exceed $250.00 and the requester has no history of payment, or when, for fees of any amount, there is evidence that the requester may not pay the fees which would be accrued by processing the request. NACIC will hold in abeyance for forty-five (45) days those requests where deposits have been requested.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Schedule of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The schedule of fees for services performed in responding to requests for records is established as follows:</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application of schedule.</E> Personnel search time includes time expended in either manual paper records searches, indices searches, review of computer search results for relevance, personal computer system searches, and various reproduction services. In any event where the actual cost to NACIC of a particular item is less than the above schedule (e.g., a large production run of a document resulted in a cost less than $5.00 per hundred pages), then the actual lesser cost will be charged.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other services.</E> For all other types of output, production, or reproduction (e.g., photographs, maps, or published reports), actual cost or amounts authorized by statute. Determinations of actual cost shall include the commercial cost of the media, the personnel time expended in making the item to be released, and an allocated cost of the equipment used in making the item, or, if the production is effected by a commercial service, then that charge shall be deemed the actual cost for purposes of this part.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Limitations on collection of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> No fees will be charged if the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than the fee itself. That cost includes the administrative costs to NACIC of billing, receiving, recording, and processing the fee for deposit to the Treasury Department and, as of the date of these regulations, is deemed to be $10.00.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests for personal information.</E> No fees will be charged for requesters seeking records about themselves under the FOIA; such requests are processed in accordance with both the FOIA and the Privacy Act in order to ensure the maximum disclosure without charge.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fee categories.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters for fee purposes: “commercial use” requesters, “educational and non-commercial scientific institution” requesters, “representatives of the news media” requesters, and “all other” requesters. The categories are defined in § 1800.2, and applicable fees, which are the same in two of the categories, will be assessed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) “Commercial use” requesters: Charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating responsive records (if any);</P>
              <P>(2) “Educational and non-commercial scientific institution” requesters as well as “representatives of the news media” requesters: Only charges for reproduction beyond the first 100 pages;</P>
              <P>(3) “All other” requesters: Charges which recover the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing responsive records (if any) beyond the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time which will be furnished without charge.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Associated requests.</E> A requester or associated requesters may not file a series of multiple requests, which are merely discrete subdivisions of the information actually sought for the purpose of avoiding or reducing applicable fees. In such instances, NACIC may aggregate the requests and charge the applicable fees.</P>

              <P>In order to avoid unanticipated or potentially large fees, a requester may submit a request for a fee estimate. Pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, NACIC will endeavor within twenty (20) days to provide an accurate estimate, and, if a request is thereafter submitted, NACIC will not accrue or charge fees in excess of our estimate without the specific permission of the requester.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Processing of requests for records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Requests meeting the requirements of §§ 1800.11 through 1800.13 shall be accepted as formal requests and processed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and these regulations. Pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, upon receipt, NACIC shall within twenty (20) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary <PRTPAGE P="348"/>taskings to the NACIC components reasonably believed to hold responsive records.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Database of “officially released information.”</E> As an alternative to extensive tasking and as an accommodation to many requesters, NACIC maintains a database of “officially released information” which contains copies of documents released by NACIC. Searches of this database can be accomplished expeditiously. Moreover, requests that are specific and well-focused will often incur minimal, if any, costs. Requesters interested in this means of access should so indicate in their correspondence. Consistent with the mandate of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, on-line electronic access to these records is available to the public. Detailed information regarding such access is available from the point of contact specified in § 1800.3.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of certain exemptions.</E> In processing a request, NACIC shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 and may jeopardize intelligence sources or methods protected pursuant to section 103(c)(6) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such circumstances, NACIC, in the form of a final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> Pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, NACIC will utilize every effort to determine within the statutory guideline of twenty (20) days after receipt of an initial request whether to comply with such a request. However, should the volume of requests require that NACIC seek additional time from a requester pursuant to § 1800.33, NACIC will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal of any adverse determination.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial action for access.</E> (1) NACIC components tasked pursuant to a FOIA request shall search all relevant record systems within their cognizance. They shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Determine whether a record exists;</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine whether and to what extent any FOIA exemptions apply;</P>
              <P>(iii) Approve the disclosure of all non-exempt records or portions of records for which they are the originator; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or interested party.</P>
              <P>(2) In making these decisions, the NACIC component officers shall be guided by the applicable law as well as the procedures specified at § 1800.31 and § 1800.32 regarding confidential commercial information and personal information (about persons other than the requester).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Referrals and coordinations.</E> As applicable and within twenty (20) days, pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, of receipt by the Coordinator, any NACIC records containing information originated by other NACIC components shall be forwarded to those entities for action in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and return. Records originated by other federal agencies or NACIC records containing other federal agency information shall be forwarded to such agencies within twenty (20) days of our completion of initial action in the case for action under their regulations and direct response to the requester (for other agency records) or return to NACIC (for NACIC records).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees in general.</E> Fees collected under this part do not accrue to the National Counterintelligence Center and shall be deposited immediately to the general account of the United States Treasury.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification of decision.</E> Upon completion of all required review and the <PRTPAGE P="349"/>receipt of accrued fees (or promise to pay such fees), NACIC will promptly inform the requester in writing of those records or portions of records which may be released and which must be denied. With respect to the former, NACIC will provide copies; with respect to the latter, NACIC shall explain the reasons for the denial, identify the person(s) responsible for such decisions by name and title, and give notice of a right of administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Availability of reading room.</E> As an alternative to receiving records by mail, a requester may arrange to inspect the records deemed releasable at a NACIC “reading room” in the metropolitan Washington, DC area. Access will be granted after applicable and accrued fees have been paid. Requests to review or browse documents in our database of “officially released records” will also be honored in this manner to the extent that paper copies or electronic copies in unclassified computer systems exist. All such requests shall be in writing and addressed pursuant to § 1800.3. The records will be available at such times as mutually agreed but not less than three (3) days from our receipt of a request. The requester will be responsible for reproduction charges for any copies of records desired.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Business information</E> means commercial or financial information in which a legal entity has a recognized property interest;</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means such business information provided to the United States Government by a submitter which is reasonably believed to contain information exempt from release under exemption (b)(4) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm;</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information to the United States Government; it includes, but is not limited to, corporations, businesses (however organized), state governments, and foreign governments; and</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> A submitter of business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be confidential commercial information and hence protected from required disclosure pursuant to exemption (b)(4). Such designations shall expire ten (10) years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Process in event of FOIA request</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> NACIC shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of a Freedom of Information Act request encompassing business information whenever:</P>
              <P>(i) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as confidential commercial information, or</P>
              <P>(ii) NACIC believes that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, and</P>
              <P>(iii) The information was submitted within the last ten (10) years unless the submitter requested and provided acceptable justification for a specific notice period of greater duration.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of notice.</E> This notice shall either describe the exact nature of the confidential commercial information at issue or provide copies of the responsive records containing such information.</P>

              <P>(A) Specify that the information has not been disclosed to the public;</P>

              <P>(B) Explain why the information is contended to be a trade secret or confidential commercial information;<PRTPAGE P="350"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) Explain how the information is capable of competitive damage if disclosed;</P>
              <P>(D) State that the submitter will provide NACIC and the Department of Justice with such litigation defense as requested; and</P>
              <P>(E) Be certified by an officer authorized to legally bind the corporation or similar entity.</P>
              <P>(ii) It should be noted that information provided by a submitter pursuant to this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Decision and notice of intent to disclose.</E> (i) NACIC shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to its final determination. If NACIC decides to disclose a document over the objection of a submitter, NACIC shall provide the submitter a written notice which shall include:</P>
              <P>(A) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;</P>
              <P>(B) A description of the information to be disclosed; and</P>
              <P>(C) A specified disclosure date which is seven (7) days after the date of the instant notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, NACIC shall also notify the requester and, if NACIC notifies a submitter that it intends to disclose information, then the requester shall be notified also and given the proposed date for disclosure.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> If a requester initiates a civil action seeking to compel disclosure of information asserted to be within the scope of this section, NACIC shall promptly notify the submitter. The submitter, as specified above, shall provide such litigation assistance as required by NACIC and the Department of Justice.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirement.</E> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if NACIC determines that:</P>
              <P>(i) The information should not be disclosed in light of other FOIA exemptions;</P>
              <P>(ii) The information has been published lawfully or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
              <P>(iii) The disclosure of the information is otherwise required by law or federal regulation; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The designation made by the submitter under this section appears frivolous, except that, in such a case, NACIC will, within a reasonable time prior to the specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Personal information concerning individuals other than the requester shall not be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act if the proposed release would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6). For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Personal information</E> means any information about an individual that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that arise from Government possession of such information.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Otherwise.</E> A requester seeking information on a third person is encouraged to provide a signed affidavit or declaration from the third person waiving all or some of their privacy rights. However, all such waivers shall be narrowly construed and the Coordinator, in the exercise of his discretion and administrative authority, may seek clarification from the third party prior to any or all releases.</P>

The Information and Privacy Coordinator is responsible for management of the NACIC-wide program defined by this part and for establishing priorities for cases consistent with established law. The Director, NACIC shall provide policy and resource direction as necessary and render decisions on administrative appeals.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for extension of time.</E> When NACIC is unable to meet the statutory time requirements of the FOIA, it will inform the requester that the request cannot be processed within the statutory time limits, provide an opportunity for the requester to limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed within the statutory time limits, or arrange with the requester an agreed upon time frame for processing the request, or determine that exceptional circumstances mandate additional time in accordance with the definition of “exceptional circumstances” per section 552(a)(6)(C) of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, effective October 2, 1997. In such instances NACIC will, however, inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate.</P>

Exceptions to this section will only be made in accordance with the following procedures. In all circumstances, however, and consistent with established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or other federal, state, or foreign judicial or quasi-judicial rules) will not be granted expedited processing under this or related (e.g., Privacy Act) provisions unless expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

A requester may make such a request with a certification of “compelling need” and, within ten (10) days of receipt, NACIC will decide whether to grant expedited processing and will notify the requester of its decision. The certification shall set forth with specificity the relevant facts upon which the requester relies and it appears to NACIC that substantive records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable. A “compelling need” is deemed to exist:</P>
              <P>(1) When the matter involves an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(2) When the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information and the information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Individuals seeking access to or amendment of records concerning themselves shall provide their full (legal) name, address, date and place of birth, and current citizenship status together with a statement that such information is true under penalty of perjury or a notarized statement swearing to or affirming identity.

              <SUBJECT>Processing requests for access to or amendment of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Requests meeting the requirements of § 1801.11 through § 1801.13 shall be processed under both the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the applicable regulations, unless the requester demands otherwise in writing. Such requests will be processed under both Acts regardless of whether the requester cites one Act in the request, both, or neither. This action is taken in order to ensure the maximum possible disclosure to the requester.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Receipt, recording and tasking.</E> Upon receipt of a request meeting the requirements of §§ 1801.11 through 1801.13, NACIC shall within ten (10) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to the requester, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the office(s) reasonably believed to hold responsive records.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of certain exemptions.</E> In processing a request, NACIC shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 and that confirmation of the existence of a record may jeopardize intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to section 103(c)(6) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such circumstances, NACIC, in the form of a final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> Although the Privacy Act does not mandate a time for response, our joint treatment of requests under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA means that the NACIC should provide a response within the FOIA statutory guideline of ten (10) days on initial requests and twenty (20) days on administrative appeals. However, the volume of requests may require that NACIC seek additional time from a requester pursuant to § 1801.33. In such event, NACIC will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or <PRTPAGE P="356"/>her right to file an administrative appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Action and determination(s) by originator(s) or any interested party.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial action for access.</E> NACIC offices tasked pursuant to a Privacy Act access request shall search all relevant record systems within their cognizance. They shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine whether responsive records exist;</P>
              <P>(2) Determine whether access must be denied in whole or part and on what legal basis under both Acts in each such case;</P>
              <P>(3) Approve the disclosure of records for which they are the originator; and</P>
              <P>(4) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or interested party as well as the specific determinations with respect to denials (if any).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial action for amendment.</E> NACIC offices tasked pursuant to a Privacy Act amendment request shall review the official records alleged to be inaccurate and the proposed amendment submitted by the requester. If they determine that NACIC's records are not accurate, relevant, timely or complete, they shall promptly:</P>
              <P>(1) Make the amendment as requested;</P>
              <P>(2) Write to all other identified persons or agencies to whom the record has been disclosed (if an accounting of the disclosure was made) and inform of the amendment; and</P>
              <P>(3) Inform the Coordinator of such decisions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Action otherwise on amendment request.</E> If the NACIC office records manager declines to make the requested amendment (or declines to make the requested amendment) but agrees to augment the official records, that manager shall promptly:</P>
              <P>(1) Set forth the reasons for refusal; and</P>

Records originated by other federal agencies or NACIC records containing other federal information shall be forwarded to such agencies within ten (10) days of our completion of initial action in the case for action under their regulations and direct response to the requester (for other NACIC records) or return to NACIC (for NACIC records).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> When a request for access or amendment involves medical or psychological records and when the originator determines that such records are not exempt from disclosure, NACIC will, after consultation with the Director of Medical Services, CIA, determine:</P>
              <P>(1) Which records may be sent directly to the requester and</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure for records to be sent to physician.</E> In the event that NACIC determines, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that records should not be sent directly to the requester, NACIC will notify the requester in writing and advise that the records at issue can be made available only to a physician of the requester's designation. Upon receipt of such designation, verification of the identity of the physician, and agreement by the physician:</P>
              <P>(1) To review the documents with the requesting individual,</P>
              <P>(2) To explain the meaning of the documents, and</P>

NACIC will also advise the requester of the responsible official and of his or her rights to administrative appeal and thereafter judicial review.</P>

              <P>(a) All requests will be handled in the order received on a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis. Exceptions to this rule will only be made in circumstances that NACIC deems to be exceptional. In making this determination, NACIC shall consider and must decide in the affirmative on all of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) That there is a genuine need for the records; and</P>
              <P>(2) That the personal need is exceptional; and</P>
              <P>(3) That there are no alternative forums for the records sought; and</P>

              <P>(b) In sum, requests shall be considered for expedited processing only when health, humanitarian, or due process considerations involving possible deprivation of life or liberty create circumstances of exceptional urgency and extraordinary need. In accordance with established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or equivalent state rules) will not be granted expedited processing under this or related (e.g., Freedom of Information Act) provisions unless expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

The Information and Privacy Coordinator is responsible for management of the NACIC-wide program defined by this part and for establishing priorities for cases consistent with established law.

In such instances NACIC will inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in question has been the subject of an administrative review within the previous two (2) years or is the subject of pending litigation in the federal courts.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Receipt, recording, and tasking.</E> NACIC shall promptly record each administrative appeal, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the office chief in charge of the office(s) which originated or has an interest in the record(s) subject to the appeal.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Former Presidential appointees.</E> Any former Presidential appointee as defined herein may also submit a request to be given access to any classified records which they originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving in that capacity. Such appointees may also request approval for a research associate but there is no entitlement to such enlargement of access and the decision in this regard shall be in the sole discretion of NACIC. Requests from appointees shall be in writing to the Coordinator and shall identify the records of interest.</P>

              <P>(2) That such access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security (by originator and interested party, if any);</P>
              <P>(3) That a non-disclosure agreement has been or will be executed by the requester (or research associate, if any) and other appropriate steps have been taken to assure that classified information will not be disclosed or otherwise compromised;</P>
              <P>(4) That a pre-publication agreement has been or will be executed by the requester (or research associate, if any) which provides for a review of notes and any resulting manuscript by the Deputy Director of NACIC;</P>

            <P>(d) If oral or written testimony is sought by a demand in a case or matter in which the NACIC is not a party, a reasonably detailed description of the testimony sought, in the form of an affidavit or, if that is not feasible, a written statement, by the party seeking the testimony or by the party's attorney must be furnished to the NACIC Counsel.</P>

            <P>(6) The NACIC may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability, nor may the NACIC establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the NACIC are not, themselves, covered by this part.</P>
            <P>(c) The exclusion of persons without disabilities from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or Executive Order to individuals with disabilities or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with disabilities from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive Order to a different class of individuals with disabilities is not prohibited by this part.</P>

            <P>(iv) If an action would result in that alteration or those burdens, the NACIC shall take any other action that would not result in the alteration of burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(a) The NACIC shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public as follows:</P>
            <P>(1)(i) The NACIC shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids if necessary to afford an individual with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the NACIC.</P>
            <P>(ii) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the NACIC shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with disabilities.</P>

            <P>(c) This section does not require the NACIC to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where NACIC personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the NACIC has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1807.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the NACIC head or his or her designee after considering all NACIC resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the NACIC shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Control</E> means ownership or the authority of the CIA pursuant to federal statute or privilege to regulate official or public access to records;</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordinator</E> means the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator who serves as the Agency manager of the information review and release program instituted under the Freedom of Information Act;</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which an agency actually incurs in the processing of a FOIA request; it does not include overhead factors such as space; it does include:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Pages</E> means paper copies of standard office size or the dollar value equivalent in other media;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reproduction</E> means generation of a copy of a requested record in a form appropriate for release;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review</E> means all time expended in examining a record to determine whether any portion must be withheld pursuant to law and in effecting any <PRTPAGE P="382"/>required deletions but excludes personnel hours expended in resolving general legal or policy issues; it also means personnel hours of professional time;</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Search</E> means all time expended in looking for and retrieving material that may be responsive to a request utilizing available paper and electronic indices and finding aids; it also means personnel hours of professional time or the dollar value equivalent in computer searches;</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Expression of interest</E> means a written communication submitted by a member of the public requesting information on or concerning the FOIA program and/or the availability of documents from the CIA;</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Federal agency</E> means any executive department, military department, or other establishment or entity included in the definition of agency in 5 U.S.C. 552(f);</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Fees</E> means those direct costs which may be assessed a requester considering the categories established by the FOIA; requesters should submit information to assist the Agency in determining the proper fee category and the Agency may draw reasonable inferences from the identity and activities of the requester in making such determinations; the fee categories include:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial</E> means a request in which the disclosure sought is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester and which furthers such commercial, trade, income or profit interests;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-commercial educational or scientific institution</E> means a request from an accredited United States educational institution at any academic level or institution engaged in research concerning the social, biological, or physical sciences or an instructor or researcher or member of such institutions; it also means that the information will be used in a specific scholarly or analytical work, will contribute to the advancement of public knowledge, and will be disseminated to the general public;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of “freelance” journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but agencies may also look to the past publication record of a requestor in making this determination:</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">All other</E> means a request from an individual not within paragraph (h)(1), (2), or (3) of this section;</P>

              <P>(j) <E T="03">Interested party</E> means any official in the executive, military, congressional, or judicial branches of government, United States or foreign, or U.S. Government contractor who, in the sole discretion of the CIA, has a subject matter or physical interest in the documents or information at issue;</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Originator</E> means the U.S. Government official who originated the document at issue or successor in office or such official who has been delegated release or declassification authority pursuant to law;</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Potential requester</E> means a person, organization, or other entity who submits an expression of interest;</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Reasonably described records</E> means a description of a document (record) by unique identification number or descriptive terms which permit an Agency employee to locate documents with reasonable effort given existing indices and finding aids;<PRTPAGE P="383"/>
              </P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Records</E> or <E T="03">agency records</E> means all documents, irrespective of physical or electronic form, made or received by the CIA in pursuance of federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and appropriate for preservation by the CIA as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the CIA or because of the informational value of the data contained therein; it does not include:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Books, newspapers, magazines, journals, magnetic or printed transcripts of electronic broadcasts, or similar public sector materials</E> acquired generally and/or maintained for library or reference purposes; to the extent that such materials are incorporated into any form of analysis or otherwise distributed or published by the Agency, they are fully subject to the disclosure provisions of the FOIA;</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Routing and transmittal sheets and notes and filing or destruction notes</E> which do not also include information, comment, or statements of substance;</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Responsive records</E> means those documents (i.e., records) which the Agency has determined to be within the scope of a FOIA request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preliminary Information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Members of the public shall address all communications to the CIA Coordinator as specified at 32 CFR 1900.03 and clearly delineate the communication as a request under the Freedom of Information Act and this regulation. CIA employees receiving a communication in the nature of a FOIA request shall expeditiously forward same to the Coordinator. Requests and appeals on requests, referrals, or coordinations received from members of the public who owe outstanding fees for information services at this or other federal agencies will not be accepted and action on all pending requests shall be terminated in such circumstances.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements as to form and content.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Required information.</E> No particular form is required. A request need only reasonably describe the records of interest. This means that documents must be described sufficiently to enable a professional employee familiar with the subject to locate the documents with a reasonable effort. Commonly this equates to a requirement that the documents must be locatable through the indexing of our various systems. Extremely broad or vague requests or requests requiring research do not satisfy this requirement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional information for fee determination.</E> In addition, a requester should provide sufficient personal identifying information to allow us to determine the appropriate fee category. A requester should also provide an agreement to pay all applicable fees or fees not to exceed a certain amount or request a fee waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Otherwise.</E> Communications which do not meet these requirements will be considered an expression of interest and the Agency will work with, and <PRTPAGE P="384"/>offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to define a request properly.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1900.13</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Fees for record services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Search, review, and reproduction fees will be charged in accordance with the provisions below relating to schedule, limitations, and category of requester. Applicable fees will be due even if our search locates no responsive records or some or all of the responsive records must be denied under one or more of the exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fee waiver requests.</E> Records will be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate whenever the Agency determines:</P>
              <P>(1) That, as a matter of administrative discretion, the interest of the United States Government would be served, or</P>
              <P>(2) That it is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the United States Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; the Agency shall consider the following factors when making this determination:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the subject of the request concerns the operations or activities of the United States Government; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute to an understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents will contribute to public understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of United States Government operations and activities; and</P>
              <P>(v) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,</P>
              <P>(vi) Whether the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee waiver appeals.</E> Denials of requests for fee waivers or reductions may be appealed to the Chair of the Agency Release Panel via the Coordinator. A requester is encouraged to provide any explanation or argument as to how his or her request satisfies the statutory requirement set forth above.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for fee waiver requests and appeals.</E> It is suggested that such requests and appeals be made and resolved prior to the initiation of processing and the incurring of costs. However, fee waiver requests will be accepted at any time prior to the release of documents or the completion of a case, and fee waiver appeals within forty-five (45) days of our initial decision subject to the following condition: If processing has been initiated, then the requester must agree to be responsible for costs in the event of an adverse administrative or judicial decision.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> In order to protect requesters from large and/or unanticipated charges, the Agency will request specific commitment when it estimates that fees will exceed $100.00. The Agency will hold in abeyance for forty-five (45) days requests requiring such agreement and will thereafter deem the request closed. This action, of course, would not prevent an individual from refiling his or her FOIA request with a fee commitment at a subsequent date.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Deposits.</E> The Agency may require an advance deposit of up to 100 percent of the estimated fees when fees may exceed $250.00 and the requester has no history of payment, or when, for fees of any amount, there is evidence that the requester may not pay the fees which would be accrued by processing the request. The Agency will hold in abeyance for forty-five (45) days those requests where deposits have been requested.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Schedule of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The schedule of fees for services performed in responding to requests for records is established as follows:</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application of schedule.</E> Personnel search time includes time expended in either manual paper records searches, indices searches, review of computer search results for relevance, personal computer system searches, and various reproduction services. In any event where the actual cost to the Agency of a particular item is less than the above schedule (e.g., a large production run of a document resulted in a cost less than $5.00 per hundred pages), then the actual lesser cost will be charged. Items published and available at the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) are also available from CIA pursuant to this part at the NTIS price as authorized by statute.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other services.</E> For all other types of output, production, or reproduction (e.g., photographs, maps, or published reports), actual cost or amounts authorized by statute. Determinations of actual cost shall include the commercial cost of the media, the personnel time expended in making the item to be released, and an allocated cost of the equipment used in making the item, or, if the production is effected by a commercial service, then that charge shall be deemed the actual cost for purposes of this part.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Limitations on collection of fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> No fees will be charged if the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than the fee itself. That cost includes the administrative costs to the Agency of billing, receiving, recording, and processing the fee for deposit to the Treasury Department and, as of the date of these regulations, is deemed to be $10.00.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests for personal information.</E> No fees will be charged for requesters seeking records about themselves under the FOIA; such requests are processed in accordance with both the FOIA and the Privacy Act in order to ensure the maximum disclosure without charge.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fee categories.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters for fee purposes: <E T="03">Commercial use</E> requesters, <E T="03">educational and non-commercial scientific institution</E> requesters, <E T="03">representatives of the news media</E> requesters, and <E T="03">all other</E> requesters. The categories are defined in § 1900.02, and applicable fees, which are the same in two of the categories, will be assessed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use</E> requesters: Charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating responsive records (if any);</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution</E> requesters as well as “<E T="03">representatives of the news media</E>” requesters: Only charges for reproduction beyond the first 100 pages;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">All other</E> requesters: Charges which recover the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing responsive records (if any) beyond the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time which will be furnished without charge.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Associated requests.</E> A requester or associated requesters may not file a series of multiple requests, which are merely discrete subdivisions of the information actually sought for the purpose of avoiding or reducing applicable fees. In such instances, the Agency may aggregate the requests and charge the applicable fees.</P>

              <P>In order to avoid unanticipated or potentially large fees, a requester may submit a request for a fee estimate. The Agency will endeavor within ten (10) days to provide an accurate estimate, and, if a request is thereafter submitted, the Agency will not accrue or charge fees in excess of our estimate without the specific permission of the requester. Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is modified to <PRTPAGE P="386"/>twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Processing of requests for records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Requests meeting the requirements of §§ 1900.11 through 1900.13 shall be accepted as formal requests and processed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and these regulations. Upon receipt, the Agency shall within ten (10) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the CIA components reasonably believed to hold responsive records. Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Database of “officially released information.”</E> As an alternative to extensive tasking and as an accommodation to many requesters, the Agency maintains a database of “officially released information” which contains copies of documents released by this Agency. Searches of this database, containing currently in excess of 500,000 pages, can be accomplished expeditiously. Moreover, requests that are specific and well-focused will often incur minimal, if any, costs. Requesters interested in this means of access should so indicate in their correspondence. Effective November 1, 1997 and consistent with the mandate of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, on-the public. Detailed information regarding such access will line electronic access to these records will be available to be available at that time from the point of contact specified in § 1900.03.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of certain exemptions.</E> In processing a request, the Agency shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 or revealing of intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to section 103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such circumstances, the Agency, in the form of a final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> The Agency will utilize every effort to determine within the statutory guideline of ten (10) days after receipt of an initial request whether to comply with such a request. However, the current volume of requests require that the Agency seek additional time from a requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.33. In such event, the Agency will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal of any adverse determination. Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial action for access.</E> CIA components tasked pursuant to a FOIA request shall search all relevant record systems within their cognizance which have not been excepted from search by the provisions of the CIA Information Act of 1984. They shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine whether a record exists;</P>
              <P>(2) Determine whether and to what extent any FOIA exemptions apply;</P>
              <P>(3) Approve the disclosure of all non-exempt records or portions of records for which they are the originator; and</P>
              <P>(4) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or interested party. In making these decisions, the CIA component officers shall be guided by the applicable law as well as the procedures specified at 32 CFR 1900.31 and 32 CFR 1900.32 regarding confidential commercial information and personal information (about persons other than the requester).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Referrals and coordinations.</E> As applicable and within ten (10) days of receipt by the Coordinator, any CIA records containing information originated by other CIA components shall be forwarded to those entities for action in accordance with paragraph (a) <PRTPAGE P="387"/>of this section and return. Records originated by other federal agencies or CIA records containing other federal agency information shall be forwarded to such agencies within ten (10) days of our completion of initial action in the case for action under their regulations and direct response to the requester (for other agency records) or return to the CIA (for CIA records). Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification of decision.</E> Upon completion of all required review and the receipt of accrued fees (or promise to pay such fees), the Agency will promptly inform the requester in writing of those records or portions of records which may be released and which must be denied. With respect to the former, the Agency will provide copies; with respect to the latter, the Agency shall explain the reasons for the denial, identify the person(s) responsible for such decisions by name and title, and give notice of a right of administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Availability of reading room.</E> As an alternative to receiving records by mail, a requester may arrange to inspect the records deemed releasable at a CIA “reading room” in the metropolitan Washington, DC area. Access will be granted after applicable and accrued fees have been paid. Requests to review or browse documents in our database of “officially released records” will also be honored in this manner to the extent that paper copies or electronic copies in unclassified computer systems exist. All such requests shall be in writing and addressed pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.03. The records will be available at such times as mutually agreed but not less than three (3) days from our receipt of a request. The requester will be responsible for reproduction charges for any copies of records desired.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Business information obtained by the Central Intelligence Agency by a submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Business information</E> means commercial or financial information in which a legal entity has a recognized property interest;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means such business information provided to the United States Government by a submitter which is reasonably believed to contain information exempt from release under exemption (b)(4) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information to the United States Government; it includes, but is not limited to, corporations, businesses (however organized), state governments, and foreign governments; and</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> A submitter of business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be confidential commercial information and hence protected from required disclosure pursuant to exemption (b)(4). Such designations shall expire ten (10) years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Process in event of FOIA request</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> The Agency shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of a Freedom of Information Act request encompassing business information whenever:<PRTPAGE P="388"/>

              <P>(iii) The information was submitted within the last ten (10) years unless the submitter requested and provided acceptable justification for a specific notice period of greater duration.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of notice.</E> This notice shall either describe the exact nature of the confidential commercial information at issue or provide copies of the responsive records containing such information.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Response by submitter.</E> (i) Within seven (7) days of the above notice, all claims of confidentiality by a submitter must be supported by a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Specify that the information has not been disclosed to the public;</P>
              <P>(B) Explain why the information is contended to be a trade secret or confidential commercial information;</P>
              <P>(C) Explain how the information is capable of competitive damage if disclosed;</P>
              <P>(D) State that the submitter will provide the Agency and the Department of Justice with such litigation defense as requested; and</P>
              <P>(E) Be certified by an officer authorized to legally bind the corporation or similar entity.</P>
              <P>(ii) It should be noted that information provided by a submitter pursuant to this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Decision and notice of intent to disclose.</E> (i) The Agency shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to its final determination. If the Agency decides to disclose a document over the objection of a submitter, the Agency shall provide the submitter a written notice which shall include:</P>
              <P>(A) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;</P>
              <P>(B) A description of the information to be disclosed; and</P>
              <P>(C) A specified disclosure date which is seven (7) days after the date of the instant notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the Agency shall also notify the requester and, if the Agency notifies a submitter that it intends to disclose information, then the requester shall be notified also and given the proposed date for disclosure.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> If a requester initiates a civil action seeking to compel disclosure of information asserted to be within the scope of this section, the Agency shall promptly notify the submitter. The submitter, as specified above, shall provide such litigation assistance as required by the Agency and the Department of Justice.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirement.</E> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if the Agency determines that:</P>
              <P>(i) The information should not be disclosed in light of other FOIA exemptions;</P>
              <P>(ii) The information has been published lawfully or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
              <P>(iii) The disclosure of the information is otherwise required by law or federal regulation; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The designation made by the submitter under this section appears frivolous, except that, in such a case, the Agency will, within a reasonable time prior to the specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>

See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6). For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Personal information</E> means any information about an individual that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that arise from Government possession of such information.<PRTPAGE P="389"/>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Discharge of FOIA responsibilities.</E> Components shall exercise due diligence in their responsibilities under the FOIA and must allocate a reasonable level of resources to requests under the Act in a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis and utilizing two or more processing queues to ensure that smaller as well as larger (i.e., project) cases receive equitable attention. The Information and Privacy Coordinator is responsible for management of the Agency-wide program defined by this part and for establishing priorities for cases consistent with established law. The Director, Information Management through the Agency Release Panel shall provide policy and resource direction as necessary and render decisions on administrative appeals.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for extension of time.</E> When the Agency is unable to meet the statutory time requirements of the FOIA, it will inform the requester that the request cannot be processed within the statutory time limits, provide an opportunity for the requester to limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed within the statutory time limits, or arrange with the requester an agreed upon time frame for processing the request, or determine that exceptional circumstances mandate additional time. In such instances the Agency will, however, inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate. Effective October 2 1997, the definition of exceptional circumstances is modified per section 552(a)(6)(C) of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for expedited processing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> All requests will be handled in the order received on a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis. Exceptions to this rule will only be made in accordance with the following procedures. In all circumstances, however, and consistent with established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or other federal, state, or foreign judicial or quasi-judicial rules) will not be granted expedited processing under this or related (e.g., Privacy Act) provisions unless expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure prior to October 2, 1997.</E> Requests for expedited processing shall be granted only in circumstances that the Agency deems to be exceptional. In making this determination, the Agency shall consider and must decide in the affirmative on all of the following factors:</P>

              <P>(i) That there is a genuine need for the specific requested records; and<PRTPAGE P="390"/>

              <P>(iv) That it is reasonably believed that substantive records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable.</P>
              <P>(2) In sum, requests shall be considered for expedited processing only when health, humanitarian, or due process considerations involving possible deprivation of life or liberty create circumstances of exceptional urgency and extraordinary need.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure on or after October 2, 1997.</E> Requests for expedited processing will be approved only when a compelling need is established to the satisfaction of the Agency. A requester may make such a request with a certification of “compelling need” and, within ten (10) days of receipt, the Agency will decide whether to grant expedited processing and will notify the requester of its decision. The certification shall set forth with specificity the relevant facts upon which the requester relies and it appears to the Agency that substantive records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable. A “compelling need” is deemed to exist:</P>
              <P>(1) When the matter involves an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(2) When the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information and the information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.</P>

The Panel shall advise and assist the HRPB on all information release issues, monitor the adequacy and <PRTPAGE P="391"/>timeliness of Agency releases, set component search and review priorities, review adequacy of resources available to and planning for all Agency release programs, and perform such other functions as deemed necessary by the Board. The Information and Privacy Coordinator also serves as Executive Secretary of the Panel. The Chair may request interested parties to participate when special equities or expertise are involved. The Panel, functioning as a committee of the whole or through individual members, will make final Agency decisions from appeals of initial adverse decisions under the Freedom of Information Act and such other information release decisions made under 32 CFR parts 1901, 1907, and 1908. Issues shall be decided by a majority of members present; in all cases of a divided vote, any member of the ARP then present may refer such matter to the HRPB by written memorandum to the Executive Secretary of the HRPB. Matters decided by the Panel or Board will be deemed a final decision by the Agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Right of appeal and appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Right of Appeal.</E> A right of administrative appeal exists whenever access to any requested record or any portion thereof is denied, no records are located in response to a request, or a request for a fee waiver is denied. The Agency will apprise all requesters in writing of their right to appeal such decisions to the CIA Agency Release Panel through the Coordinator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements as to time and form.</E> Appeals of decisions must be received by the Coordinator within forty-five (45) days of the date of the Agency's initial decision. The Agency may, for good cause and as a matter of administrative discretion, permit an additional thirty (30) days for the submission of an appeal. All appeals shall be in writing and addressed as specified in 32 CFR 1900.03. All appeals must identify the documents or portions of documents at issue with specificity and may present such information, data, and argument in support as the requester may desire.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in question has been the subject of a review within the previous two (2) years or is the subject of pending litigation in the federal courts.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Receipt, recording, and tasking.</E> The Agency shall promptly record each request received under this part, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the Deputy Director(s) in charge of the directorate(s) which originated or has an interest in the record(s) subject to the appeal. As used herein, the term Deputy Director includes an equivalent senior official in the DCI-area as well as a designee known as the Information Review Officer for a directorate or area.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> The Agency shall attempt to complete action on an appeal within twenty (20) days of the date of receipt. The current volume of requests, however, often requires that the Agency request additional time from the requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.33. In such event, the Agency will inform the requester of the right to judicial review.</P>

              <P>Each Deputy Director in charge of a directorate which originated or has an interest in any of the records subject to the appeal, or designee, is a required party to any appeal; other interested parties may become involved through the request of the Coordinator when it is determined that some or all of the information is also within their official cognizance. These parties shall respond in writing to the Coordinator with a finding as to the exempt status of the information. This response shall be provided expeditiously on a “first-in, first-out” basis taking into account the business requirements of the parties and consistent with the information rights of members of the general public under the various information review and release laws.</P>

The Executive Secretary shall provide a summation memorandum for consideration of the members; the complete record of the request consisting of the request, the document(s) (sanitized and full text) at issue, and the findings of the concerned Deputy Director(s) or designee(s).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Decision by the Agency Release Panel.</E> The Agency Release Panel shall meet and decide requests sitting as a committee of the whole. Decisions are by majority vote of those present at a meeting and shall be based on the written record and their deliberations; no personal appearances shall be permitted without the express permission of the Panel.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Decision by the Historical Records Policy Board.</E> In any cases of divided vote by the ARP, any member of that body is authorized to refer the request to the CIA Historical Records Policy Board which acts as the senior corporate board for the Agency. The record compiled (the request, the memoranda filed by the originator and interested parties, and the previous decision(s)) as well as any memorandum of law or policy the referent desires to be considered, shall be certified by the Executive Secretary of the Agency Release Panel and shall constitute the official record of the proceedings and must be included in any subsequent filings.</P>

With respect to any decision to deny information, that correspondence shall state the reasons for the decision, identify the officer responsible, and include a notice of a right to judicial review.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Receipt, recording and tasking.</E> Upon receipt of a request meeting the requirements of §§ 1901.11 through 1901.13, the Agency shall within ten (10) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to the requester, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the components reasonably believed to hold responsive records.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of certain exemptions.</E> In processing a request, the Agency shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 or revealing of intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to section 103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such circumstances, the Agency, in the form of a final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> Although the Privacy Act does not mandate a time for response, our joint treatment of requests under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA means that the Agency should provide a response within the FOIA statutory guideline of ten (10) days on initial requests and twenty (20) days on administrative appeals. However, the current volume of requests require that the Agency often seek additional time from a requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1901.33. In such event, the Agency will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial action for access.</E> CIA components tasked pursuant to a Privacy Act access request shall search all relevant record systems within their cognizance. They shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine whether responsive records exist;</P>

Records originated by other federal agencies or CIA records containing other federal agency information shall be forwarded to such agencies within ten (10) days of our completion of initial action in the case for action under their regulations and direct response to the requester (for other agency records) or return to the CIA (for CIA records).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> When a request for access or amendment involves medical or psychological records and when the originator determines that such records are not exempt from disclosure, the Agency will, after consultation with the Director of Medical Services, determine:</P>
              <P>(1) Which records may be sent directly to the requester and</P>
              <P>(2) Which records should not be sent directly to the requester because of possible medical or psychological harm to the requester or another person.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure for records to be sent to physician.</E> In the event that the Agency determines, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that records should not be sent directly to the requester, the Agency will notify the requester in writing and advise that the records at issue can be made available only to a physician of the requester's designation. Upon receipt of such designation, verification of the identity of the physician, and agreement by the physician:</P>
              <P>(1) To review the documents with the requesting individual,</P>
              <P>(2) To explain the meaning of the documents, and</P>

The Agency will also advise the requester of the responsible official and of his or her rights to administrative appeal and thereafter judicial review.</P>

Exceptions to this rule will only be made in circumstances that the Agency deems to be exceptional. In making this determination, the Agency shall consider and must decide in the affirmative on all of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) That there is a genuine need for the records; and</P>
              <P>(2) That the personal need is exceptional; and</P>

              <P>(b) In sum, requests shall be considered for expedited processing only when health, humanitarian, or due process considerations involving possible deprivation of life or liberty create circumstances of exceptional urgency and extraordinary need. In accordance with established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or equivalent state rules) will not be granted expedited processing under this or related (e.g., Freedom of Information Act) provisions unless expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

              <P>(4) The rights of all members of the public under the various information review and disclosure laws.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Discharge of Privacy Act responsibilities.</E> Components shall exercise due diligence in their responsibilities under the Privacy Act and must allocate a reasonable level of resources to requests under the Act in a strictly “first-in, first-out” basis and utilizing two or more processing queues to ensure that smaller as well as larger (i.e., project) cases receive equitable attention. The Information and Privacy Coordinator is responsible for management of the Agency-wide program defined by this part and for establishing priorities for cases consistent with established law. The Director, Information Management through the Agency Release Panel shall provide policy and resource direction as necessary and shall make determinations on administrative appeals.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for extension of time.</E> While the Privacy Act does not specify time requirements, our joint treatment of requests under the FOIA means that when the Agency is unable to meet the statutory time requirements of the FOIA, the Agency may request additional time from a requester. In such instances the Agency will inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate.</P>

Their membership, authority, and rules of procedure are as follows.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Historical Records Policy Board (“HRPB” or “Board”).</E> This Board, the successor to the CIA Information Review Committee, acts as the senior corporate board in the CIA on all matters of information review and release.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Authorities and activities.</E> The HRPB, by majority vote, may delegate to one or more of its members the authority to act on any appeal or other matter or authorize the Chair to delegate such authority, as long as such delegation is not to the same individual or body who made the initial denial. The Executive Secretary of the HRPB is the Director, Information Management. The Chair may request interested parties to participate when <PRTPAGE P="398"/>special equities or expertise are involved.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Agency Release Panel (“ARP” or “Panel”).</E> The HRPB, pursuant to its delegation of authority, has established a subordinate Agency Release Panel.</P>

The Information and Privacy Coordinator also serves as Executive Secretary of the Panel. The Chair may request interested parties to participate when special equities or expertise are involved. The Panel, functioning as a committee of the whole or through individual members, will make final Agency decisions from appeals of initial adverse decisions under the Freedom of Information Act and such other information release decisions made under 32 CFR parts 1901, 1907, and 1908. Issues shall be decided by a majority of members present; in all cases of a divided vote, any member of the ARP then present may refer such matter to the HRPB by written memorandum to the Executive Secretary of the HRPB. Matters decided by the Panel or Board will be deemed a final decision by the Agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Right of appeal and appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Right of Appeal.</E> A right of administrative appeal exists whenever access to any requested record or any portion thereof is denied, no records are located in response to a request, or a request for amendment is denied. The Agency will apprise all requesters in writing of their right to appeal such decisions to the CIA Agency Release Panel through the Coordinator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements as to time and form.</E> Appeals of decisions must be received by the Coordinator within forty-five (45) days of the date of the Agency's initial decision. The Agency may, for good cause and as a matter of administrative discretion, permit an additional thirty (30) days for the submission of an appeal. All appeals to the Panel shall be in writing and addressed as specified in 32 CFR 1901.03. All appeals must identify the documents or portions of documents at issue with specificity, provide the desired amending language (if applicable), and may present such information, data, and argument in support as the requester may desire.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in question has been the subject of an administrative review within the previous two (2) years or is the subject of pending litigation in the federal courts.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Receipt, recording, and tasking.</E> The Agency shall promptly record each administrative appeal, acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the Deputy Director(s) in charge of the directorate(s) which originated or has an interest in the record(s) subject to the appeal. As used herein, the term Deputy Director includes an equivalent senior official within the DCI-area as well as a designee known as the Information Review Officer for a directorate or area.</P>

These parties shall respond in writing to the Coordinator with a finding as to the exempt or non-exempt status of the information including citations to the applicable exemption and/or their agreement or disagreement as to the requested amendment and the reasons therefore. Each response shall be provided expeditiously on a “first-in, first-out” basis taking into account the business requirements of the parties and consistent with the information rights of members of the general public under the various information review and release laws.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Purpose of exemptions.</E> This part sets forth those systems of records or portions of systems of records which the Director of Central Intelligence has determined to exempt from the procedures established by this regulation and from certain provisions of the Privacy Act:</P>

              <P>(a) The purpose of the following specified general exemption of polygraph records is to prevent access and review of records which intimately reveal CIA operational methods. The purpose of the general exemption from the provisions of sections (c)(3) and (e)(3) (A)-(D) of the Privacy Act is to avoid disclosures that may adversely affect ongoing operational relationships with other intelligence and related organizations and thus reveal or jeopardize intelligence sources and methods or risk exposure of intelligence sources <PRTPAGE P="401"/>and methods in the processing of covert employment applications.</P>
              <P>(b) The purpose of the general exemption from sections (d), (e)(4)(G), (f)(1), and (g) of the Privacy Act is to protect only those portions of systems of records which if revealed would risk exposure of intelligence sources and methods or hamper the ability of the CIA to effectively use information received from other agencies or foreign governments.</P>

              <P>(c) It should be noted that by subjecting information which would consist of, reveal, or pertain to intelligence sources and methods to separate determinations by the Director of Central Intelligence under the provision entitled <E T="03">“General exemptions,”</E> 32 CFR 1901.62 regarding access and notice, an intent is established to apply the exemption from access and notice only in those cases where notice in itself would constitute a revelation of intelligence sources and methods; in all cases where only access to information would reveal such source or method, notice will be given upon request.</P>
              <P>(d) The purpose of the general exemption for records that consist of, pertain to, or would otherwise reveal the identities of employees who provide information to the Office of the Inspector General is to implement section 17 of the CIA Act of 1949, as amended, 50 U.S.C. 403q(e)(3), and to ensure that no action constituting a reprisal or threat of reprisal is taken because an employee has cooperated with the Office of Inspector General.</P>
              <P>(e) The purpose of the specific exemptions provided for under section (k) of the Privacy Act is to exempt only those portions of systems of records which would consist of, reveal, or pertain to that information which is enumerated in that section of the Act.</P>

            <P>(d) This section does not require the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1906.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. <PRTPAGE P="417"/>The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Agency head or his or her designee after considering all Agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Two administrative entities have been established by the Director of Central Intelligence to facilitate the processing of administrative appeals under the mandatory declassification review provisions of this Order. Their membership, authority, and rules of procedure are as follows.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Historical Records Policy Board (“HRPB” or “Board”).</E> This Board, the successor to the CIA Information Review Committee, acts as the senior corporate board in the CIA on all matters of information review and release. It is composed of the Executive Director, who serves as its Chair, the Deputy Director for Administration, the Deputy Director for Intelligence, the Deputy Director for Operations, the Deputy Director for Science and Technology, the General Counsel, the Director of Congressional Affairs, the Director of the Public Affairs Staff, the Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence, and the Associate Deputy Director for Administration/Information Services, or their designees. The Board, by majority vote, may delegate to one or more of its members the authority to act on any appeal or other matter or authorize the Chair to delegate such authority, as long as such delegation is not to the same individual or body who made the initial denial. The Executive Secretary of the HRPB is the Director, Information Management. The Chair may request interested parties to participate when special equities or expertise are involved.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Agency Release Panel (“ARP” or “Panel”).</E> The HRPB, pursuant to its delegation of authority, has established a subordinate Agency Release Panel. This Panel is composed of the Director, Information Management, who serves as its Chair; the Information Review Officers from the Directorates of Administration, Intelligence, Operations, Science and Technology, and the Director of Central Intelligence Area; the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator; the Chief, Historical Review Group; the Chair, Publications Review Board; the Chief, Records Declassification Program; and representatives from the Offices of General Counsel and Congressional Affairs, and the Public Affairs Staff. The Information and Privacy Coordinator also serves as the Executive Secretary of the Panel. The Panel advises and assists the HRPB on all information release issues, monitors the adequacy and timeliness of Agency releases, sets component search and review priorities, reviews adequacy of resources available to and planning for all Agency release programs, and performs such other functions as deemed necessary by the Board. The Chair may request interested parties to participate when special equities or expertise are involved. The Panel, functioning as a committee of the whole or through individual members, will make final Agency decisions from appeals of initial denial decisions under E.O. 12958. Issues not resolved by the Panel will be referred by the Panel to the HRPB. Matters decided by the Panel or Board will be deemed a final decision by the Agency.</P>

            <P>This part does not apply to requests for access to current information or finished intelligence that is routinely disseminated to other Federal agencies in support of the CIA's intelligence, counterintelligence, or special activities responsibilities, or for administrative purposes. This part applies to special requests for access to classified historical CIA records in furtherance of historical research and not expressly required by statute that fall outside of the regular channels and procedures that CIA has already established to provide information to U.S. Government customers. Examples include, but are not limited to, a Federal agency, including a branch of the military, conducting research in preparation for the production of a set of historical studies, an official agency history, or a review of past military activities, that require access to classified historical CIA records.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1911.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Federal agency requests for access and processing procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal agency requests.</E> Cleared staff and contractor personnel, working for a Federal agency, and seeking access to classified CIA historical records in an official capacity, shall send the request to the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator (Coordinator) identifying the particular records needed, the purpose for which the records are needed, whether declassification of the information contained <PRTPAGE P="432"/>in the records will be required, and the position and security clearances or security approvals held by the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Special procedures.</E> The Coordinator shall review the request and solicit input from the Director of the Center for the Study of Intelligence and other interested parties concerning whether or not the required determinations set forth in paragraph (c) of this section can be made. After considering any input received, the Coordinator will either make or not make the determinations set forth in paragraph (c), in consultation with the ARP, and forward the request and the Coordinator's recommendation to the Chief, Information Review and Release Group (IRRG), Information Management Services for decision on whether or not to provide the access requested. A negative determination by the Chief of IRRG shall be reviewed by the Director, Information Management Services, who shall issue the final CIA decision whether or not to grant the request for access.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determinations.</E> As a condition precedent for access, the Coordinator must make all of the following determinations with respect to each request:</P>
            <P>(1) That the requester is a current staff employee or contractor of the U.S. Government;</P>
            <P>(2) That the requester is currently cleared, or security approved, for access to classified information and that the specific clearance or security approval and access levels of that individual has been officially recorded;</P>
            <P>(3) That the scope of the request for information is clearly delineated;</P>
            <P>(4) That the information requested is reasonably accessible and can be located and compiled with a reasonable effort;</P>
            <P>(5) That a nondisclosure agreement with a prepublication review clause has been executed by the requester;</P>
            <P>(6) That all notes and any resulting document will be appropriately safeguarded, that further access will be appropriately limited, and that no further dissemination of information such as that marked ORCON (Dissemination and Extraction of Information Controlled by Originator) or HUMINT (Human Intelligence) shall be made beyond the requesting agency unless CIA permission is obtained;</P>
            <P>(7) That if the resulting document containing CIA information or equities is intended to be declassified, the document will be submitted to the Coordinator for declassification review;</P>
            <P>(8) That the information and documents will remain classified until a final declassification review and release decision is made by CIA; and,</P>
            <P>(9) That the request for access is an official agency request, made in the requester's official capacity on behalf of the requester's agency.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> (1) With respect to requests for access to CIA information and equities residing outside of CIA, upon a favorable CIA determination in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the CIA will notify both the requester and the agency holding the records with CIA equities. The requester will need to follow the access requirements of the agency holding the records in addition to any access requirements mandated by CIA.</P>
            <P>(2) If access to classified historical CIA records is granted, as a rule, such access shall be provided on CIA premises only. No copies of any classified historical CIA records shall be provided to the requester for reference and use on requester premises without the express approval of the Director, Information Management Services. In exceptional cases, if the provision of classified CIA historical records to the requester for reference and use on requester premises is permitted, the classified CIA historical records provided shall not be disclosed or disseminated beyond the requesting agency, and shall be returned to CIA or destroyed when use of the records has ended. Similarly, any notes taken that are derived from classified historical CIA records that have been accessed in accordance with this part shall not be disclosed or disseminated beyond the requesting agency.</P>

Section 1.4 specifies that information shall not be considered for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security. There is no requirement, at the time of the decision, for the original classification authority to prepare a written description of such damage. However, the original classification authority must be able to support the decision in writing, including identifying or describing the damage, should the classification decision become the subject of a challenge or access demand pursuant to the Order or law.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duration of classification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determining duration of classification for information originally classified under the Order</E>—(1) <E T="03">Establishing duration of classification.</E> Except for information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, an original classification authority shall follow the sequence listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section when determining the duration of classification for information originally classified under this Order.</P>
              <P>(i) The original classification authority shall attempt to determine a date or event that is less than 10 years from the date of original classification and which coincides with the lapse of the information's national security sensitivity, and shall assign such date or event as the declassification instruction.</P>
              <P>(ii) If unable to determine a date or event of less than 10 years, the original classification authority shall ordinarily assign a declassification date that is 10 years from the date of the original classification decision.</P>
              <P>(iii) If unable to determine a date or event of 10 years, the original classification authority shall assign a declassification date not to exceed 25 years from the date of the original classification decision.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Duration of classification of special categories of information.</E> The only exceptions to the sequence in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If an original classification authority is classifying information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source, the duration shall be up to 75 years and shall be designated with the following marking, “50X1-HUM;” or</P>
              <P>(ii) If an original classification authority is classifying information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the duration shall be up to 75 years and shall be designated with the following marking, “50X2-WMD.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Extending duration of classification for information classified under the Order.</E> Extensions of classification are not automatic. If an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information does not extend the classification of information assigned a date or event for declassification, the information is automatically declassified upon the occurrence of the date or event.</P>
              <P>(1) If the date or event assigned by the original classification authority has not passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may extend the classification duration of such information for a period not to exceed 25 years from the date of origin of the record.</P>
              <P>(2) If the date or event assigned by the original classification authority has passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may reclassify the information in accordance with the Order and this Directive only if it meets the standards for classification under sections 1.1 and 1.5 of the Order as well as section 3.3 of the Order, if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) In all cases, when extending the duration of classification, the original classification authority must:</P>
              <P>(i) Be an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information;</P>
              <P>(ii) Ensure that the information continues to meet the standards for classification under the Order; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Make reasonable attempts to notify all known holders of the information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Duration of information classified under prior orders</E>—(1) <E T="03">Specific date or event.</E> Unless declassified earlier, information marked with a specific date or event for declassification under a prior order is automatically declassified upon that date or event. If the specific date or event has not passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may extend the duration in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the date or event assigned by the original classification authority has passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may only reclassify information in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="438"/>the standards and procedures under the Order and this Directive. If the information is contained in records determined to be permanently valuable, and the prescribed date or event will take place more than 25 years from the date of origin of the document, the declassification of the information will instead be subject to section 3.3 of the Order.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Indefinite duration of classification.</E> For information marked with X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, or X8; “Originating Agency's Determination Required” or its acronym “OADR,” “Manual Review” or its acronym “MR;” “DCI Only;” “DNI Only;” and any other marking indicating an indefinite duration of classification under a prior order; or in those cases where a document is missing a required declassification instruction or the instruction is not complete:</P>
              <P>(i) A declassification authority, as defined in section 3.1(b) of the Order, may declassify it;</P>
              <P>(ii) An original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may re-mark the information to establish a duration of classification of no more than 25 years from the date of origin of the document, consistent with the requirements for information originally classified under the Order, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Unless declassified earlier, such information contained in records determined to be permanently valuable shall remain classified for 25 years from the date of its origin, at which time it will be subject to section 3.3 of the Order.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Release of imagery acquired by space-based intelligence reconnaissance systems.</E> The duration of classification of imagery as defined in E.O. 12951, <E T="03">Release of Imagery Acquired by Space-Based Intelligence Reconnaissance Systems,</E> that is otherwise marked with an indefinite duration, such as “DCI Only” or “DNI Only,” shall be established by the Director of National Intelligence in accordance with E.O. 12951 and consistent with E.O. 13526. Any such information shall be remarked in accordance with instructions prescribed by the Director of National Intelligence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Classification prohibitions and limitations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Declassification without proper authority.</E> Classified information that has been declassified without proper authority, as determined by an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information, remains classified and administrative action shall be taken to restore markings and controls, as appropriate. All such determinations shall be reported to the senior agency official who shall promptly provide a written report to the Director of ISOO.</P>
              <P>(1) If the information at issue is in records in the physical and legal custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and has been made available to the public, the original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information shall, as part of determining whether the restoration of markings and controls is appropriate, consider whether the removal of the information from public purview will significantly mitigate the harm to national security or otherwise draw undue attention to the information at issue. Written notification, classified when appropriate under the Order, shall be made to the Archivist, which shall include a description of the record(s) at issue, the elements of information that are classified, the duration of classification, and the specific authority for continued classification. If the information at issue is more than 25 years of age and the Archivist does not agree with the decision, the information shall nonetheless be temporarily withdrawn from public access and shall be referred to the Director of ISOO for resolution in collaboration with affected parties.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reclassification after declassification and release to the public under proper authority.</E> In making the decision to reclassify information that has been declassified and released to the public under proper authority, the agency head must approve, in writing, a determination on a document-by-document basis that the reclassification is required to prevent significant and demonstrable damage to the national security. As part of making such a determination, the following shall apply:<PRTPAGE P="439"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The information must be reasonably recoverable without bringing undue attention to the information which means that:</P>
              <P>(i) Most individual recipients or holders are known and can be contacted and all instances of the information to be reclassified will not be more widely disseminated;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the information has been made available to the public via a means such as Government archives or reading room, consideration is given to length of time the record has been available to the public, the extent to which the record has been accessed for research, and the extent to which the record and/or classified information at issue has been copied, referenced, or publicized; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the information has been made available to the public via electronic means such as the internet, consideration is given as to the number of times the information was accessed, the form of access, and whether the information at issue has been copied, referenced, or publicized.</P>
              <P>(2) If the reclassification concerns a record in the physical custody of NARA and has been available for public use, reclassification requires notification to the Archivist and approval by the Director of ISOO.</P>
              <P>(3) Any recipients or holders of the reclassified information who have current security clearances shall be appropriately briefed about their continuing legal obligations and responsibilities to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure. The recipients or holders who do not have security clearances shall, to the extent practicable, be appropriately briefed about the reclassification of the information that they have had access to, their obligation not to disclose the information, and be requested to sign an acknowledgement of this briefing.</P>
              <P>(4) The reclassified information must be appropriately marked in accordance with section 2001.24(l) and safeguarded. The markings should include the authority for and the date of the reclassification action.</P>
              <P>(5) Once the reclassification action has occurred, it must be reported to the National Security Advisor and to the Director of ISOO by the agency head or senior agency official within 30 days. The notification must include details concerning paragraphs (b)(1) and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Classification by compilation.</E> A determination that information is classified through the compilation of unclassified information is a derivative classification action based upon existing original classification guidance. If the compilation of unclassified information reveals a new aspect of information that meets the criteria for classification, it shall be referred to an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information to make an original classification decision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Classification challenges.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Challenging classification.</E> Authorized holders, including authorized holders outside the classifying agency, who want to challenge the classification status of information shall present such challenges to an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information. An authorized holder is any individual who has been granted access to specific classified information in accordance with the provisions of the Order to include the special conditions set forth in section 4.1(h) of the Order. A formal challenge under this provision must be in writing, but need not be any more specific than to question why information is or is not classified, or is classified at a certain level.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency procedures.</E> (1) Because the Order encourages authorized holders to challenge classification as a means for promoting proper and thoughtful classification actions, agencies shall ensure that no retribution is taken against any authorized holders bringing such a challenge in good faith.</P>
              <P>(2) Agencies shall establish a system for processing, tracking and recording formal classification challenges made by authorized holders. Agencies shall consider classification challenges separately from Freedom of Information Act or other access requests, and shall not process such challenges in turn with pending access requests.</P>

              <P>(3) The agency shall provide an initial written response to a challenge within 60 days. If the agency is unable to respond to the challenge within 60 <PRTPAGE P="440"/>days, the agency must acknowledge the challenge in writing, and provide a date by which the agency will respond. The acknowledgment must include a statement that if no agency response is received within 120 days, the challenger has the right to forward the challenge to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) for a decision. The challenger may also forward the challenge to the Panel if an agency has not responded to an internal appeal within 90 days of the agency's receipt of the appeal. Agency responses to those challenges it denies shall include the challenger's appeal rights to the Panel.</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever an agency receives a classification challenge to information that has been the subject of a challenge within the past two years, or that is the subject of pending litigation, the agency is not required to process the challenge beyond informing the challenger of this fact and of the challenger's appeal rights, if any.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional considerations.</E> (1) Challengers and agencies shall attempt to keep all challenges, appeals and responses unclassified. However, classified information contained in a challenge, an agency response, or an appeal shall be handled and protected in accordance with the Order and this Directive. Information being challenged for classification shall remain classified unless and until a final decision is made to declassify it.</P>
              <P>(2) The classification challenge provision is not intended to prevent an authorized holder from informally questioning the classification status of particular information. Such informal inquiries should be encouraged as a means of holding down the number of formal challenges and to ensure the integrity of the classification process.</P>

              <P>(2) Originators of classification guides are encouraged to consult the <PRTPAGE P="441"/>users of guides and other subject matter experts when reviewing or updating guides. Also, users of classification guides are encouraged to notify the originator of the guide when they acquire information that suggests the need for change in the instructions contained in the guide.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Performance of fundamental classification guidance reviews.</E> An initial fundamental classification guidance review shall be completed by every agency with original classification authority and which authors security classification guides no later than June 27, 2012. Agencies shall conduct fundamental classification guidance reviews on a periodic basis thereafter. The frequency of the reviews shall be determined by each agency considering factors such as the number of classification guides and the volume and type of information they cover. However, a review shall be conducted at least once every five years.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Coverage of reviews.</E> At a minimum, the fundamental classification guidance review shall focus on:</P>
              <P>(1) Evaluation of content.</P>
              <P>(i) Determining if the guidance conforms to current operational and technical circumstances; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Determining if the guidance meets the standards for classification under section 1.4 of the Order and an assessment of likely damage under section 1.2 of the Order; and</P>
              <P>(2) Evaluation of use:</P>
              <P>(i) Determining if the dissemination and availability of the guidance is appropriate, timely, and effective; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An examination of recent classification decisions that focuses on ensuring that classification decisions reflect the intent of the guidance as to what is classified, the appropriate level, the duration, and associated markings.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Participation in reviews.</E> The agency head or senior agency official shall direct the conduct of a fundamental classification guidance review and shall ensure the appropriate agency subject matter experts participate to obtain the broadest possible range of perspectives. To the extent practicable, input should also be obtained from external subject matter experts and external users of the reviewing agency's classification guidance and decisions.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the classified information should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source, no date or event is required and the marking “50X1-HUM” shall be used in the “Declassify On” line; or</P>
              <P>(iv) If the classified information should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, no date or event is required and the marking “50X2-WMD” shall be used in the “Declassify On” line.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overall marking.</E> The highest level of classification is determined by the highest level of any one portion within the document and shall appear in a way that will distinguish it clearly from the informational text.</P>
              <P>(1) Conspicuously place the overall classification at the top and bottom of the outside of the front cover (if any), on the title page (if any), on the first page, and on the outside of the back cover (if any).</P>
              <P>(2) For documents containing information classified at more than one level, the overall marking shall be the highest level. For example, if a document contains some information marked “Secret” and other information marked “Confidential,” the overall marking would be “Secret.”</P>
              <P>(3) Each interior page of a classified document shall be marked at the top and bottom either with the highest level of classification of information contained on that page, including the designation “Unclassified” when it is applicable, or with the highest overall classification of the document.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Portion marking.</E> Each portion of a document, ordinarily a paragraph, but including subjects, titles, graphics, tables, charts, bullet statements, sub-paragraphs, classified signature blocks, <PRTPAGE P="443"/>bullets and other portions within slide presentations, and the like, shall be marked to indicate which portions are classified and which portions are unclassified by placing a parenthetical symbol immediately preceding the portion to which it applies.</P>
              <P>(1) To indicate the appropriate classification level, the symbols “(TS)” for Top Secret, “(S)” for Secret, and “(C)” for Confidential will be used.</P>
              <P>(2) Portions which do not meet the standards of the Order for classification shall be marked with “(U)” for Unclassified.</P>
              <P>(3) In cases where portions are segmented such as paragraphs, sub-paragraphs, bullets, and sub-bullets and the classification level is the same throughout, it is sufficient to put only one portion marking at the beginning of the main paragraph or main bullet. If there are different levels of classification among these segments, then all segments shall be portion marked separately in order to avoid over-classification of any one segment. If the information contained in a sub-paragraph or sub-bullet is a higher level of classification than its parent paragraph or parent bullet, this does not make the parent paragraph or parent bullet classified at that same level. Each portion shall reflect the classification level of that individual portion and not any other portions. At the same time, any portion, no matter what its status, is still capable of determining the overall classification of the document.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Dissemination control and handling markings.</E> Many agencies require additional control and handling markings that supplement the overall classification markings. See § 2001.24(j) for specific guidance.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Classified national security information in the electronic environment shall be:</P>
              <P>(1) Subject to all requirements of the Order.</P>

              <P>(2) Marked with proper classification markings to the extent that such marking is practical, including portion marking, overall classification, “Classified By,” “Derived From,” “Reason” for classification (originally classified information only), and “Declassify On.”<PRTPAGE P="445"/>
              </P>

              <P>(3) Marked with proper classification markings when appearing in an electronic output (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> database query) in which users of the information will need to be alerted to the classification status of the information.</P>
              <P>(4) Marked in accordance with derivative classification procedures, maintaining traceability of classification decisions to the original classification authority. In cases where classified information in an electronic environment cannot be marked in this manner, a warning shall be applied to alert users that the information may not be used as a source for derivative classification and providing a point of contact and instructions for users to receive further guidance on the use and classification of the information.</P>

              <P>(5) Prohibited from use as source of derivative classification if it is dynamic in nature (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wikis and blogs) and where information is not marked in accordance with the Order.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Markings on classified e-mail messages.</E> (1) E-mail transmitted on or prepared for transmission on classified systems or networks shall be configured to display the overall classification at the top and bottom of the body of each message. The overall classification marking string for the e-mail shall reflect the classification of the header and body of the message. This includes the subject line, the text of the e-mail, a classified signature block, attachments, included messages, and any other information conveyed in the body of the e-mail. A single linear text string showing the overall classification and markings shall be included in the first line of text and at the end of the body of the message after the signature block.</P>

              <P>(2) Classified e-mail shall be portion marked. Each portion shall be marked to reflect the highest level of information contained in that portion. A text portion containing a uniform resource locator (URL) or reference (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> link) to another document shall be portion marked based on the classification of the content of the URL or link text, even if the content to which it points reflects a higher classification marking.</P>
              <P>(3) A classified signature block shall be portion marked to reflect the highest classification level markings of the information contained in the signature block itself.</P>
              <P>(4) Subject lines shall be portion marked to reflect the sensitivity of the information in the subject line itself and shall not reflect any classification markings for the e-mail content or attachments. Subject lines and titles shall be portion marked before the subject or title.</P>
              <P>(5) For a classified e-mail, the classification authority block shall be placed after the signature block, but before the overall classification marking string at the end of the e-mail. These blocks may appear as single linear text strings instead of the traditional appearance of three lines of text.</P>
              <P>(6) When forwarding or replying to an e-mail, individuals shall ensure that, in addition to the markings required for the content of the reply or forward e-mail itself, the markings shall reflect the overall classification and declassification instructions for the entire string of e-mails and attachments. This will include any newly drafted material, material received from previous senders, and any attachments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Marking Web pages with classified content.</E> (1) Web pages shall be classified and marked on their own content regardless of the classification of the pages to which they link. Any presentation of information to which the web materials link shall also be marked based on its own content.</P>
              <P>(2) The overall classification marking string for every web page shall reflect the overall classification markings (and any dissemination control or handling markings) for the information on that page. Linear text appearing on both the top and bottom of the page is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(3) If any graphical representation is utilized, a text equivalent of the overall classification marking string shall be included in the hypertext statement and page metadata. This will enable users without graphic display to be aware of the classification level of the page and allows for the use of text translators.</P>

              <P>(4) Classified Web pages shall be portion marked. Each portion shall be marked to reflect the highest level of information contained in that portion. <PRTPAGE P="446"/>A portion containing a URL or reference to another document shall be portion marked based on the classification of the content of the URL itself, even if the content to which it points reflects a higher classification marking.</P>
              <P>(5) Classified Web pages shall include the classification authority block on either the top or bottom of the page. These blocks may appear as single linear text strings instead of the traditional appearance of three lines of text.</P>
              <P>(6) Electronic media files such as video, audio, images, or slides shall carry the overall classification and classification authority block, unless the addition of such information would render them inoperable. In such cases, another procedure shall be used to ensure recipients are aware of the classification status of the information and the declassification instructions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Marking classified URLs.</E> URLs provide unique addresses in the electronic environment for web content and shall be portion marked based on the classification of the content of the URL itself. The URL shall not be portion marked to reflect the classification of the content to which it points. URLs shall be developed at an unclassified level whenever possible. When a URL is classified, a classification portion mark shall be used in the text of the URL string in a way that does not make the URL inoperable to identify the URL as a classified portion in any textual references to that URL. An example may appear as:

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Marking classified dynamic documents and relational databases.</E> (1) A dynamic page contains electronic information derived from a changeable source or ad hoc query, such as a relational database. The classification levels of information returned may vary depending upon the specific request.</P>

              <P>(2) If there is a mechanism for determining the actual classification markings for dynamic documents, the appropriate classification markings shall be applied to and displayed on the document. If such a mechanism does not exist, the default should be the highest level of information in the database and a warning shall be applied at the top of each page of the document. Such content shall not be used as a basis for derivative classification. An example of such an applied warning may appear as:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>This content is classified at the [insert system-high classification level] level and may contain elements of information that are unclassified or classified at a lower level than the overall classification displayed. This content may not be used as a source of derivative classification; refer instead to the pertinent classification guide(s).</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(3) This will alert the users of the information that there may be elements of information that may be either unclassified or classified at a lower level than the highest possible classification of the information returned. Users shall be encouraged to make further inquiries concerning the status of individual elements in order to avoid unnecessary classification and/or impediments to information sharing. Resources such as classification guides and points of contact shall be established to assist with these inquiries.</P>
              <P>(4) Users developing a document based on query results from a database must properly mark the document in accordance with § 2001.22. If there is doubt about the correct markings, users should contact the database originating agency for guidance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Marking classified bulletin board postings and blogs.</E> (1) A blog, an abbreviation of the term “web log,” is a Web site consisting of a series of entries, often commentary, description of events, or other material such as graphics or video, created by the same individual as in a journal or by many individuals. While the content of the overall blog is dynamic, entries are generally static in nature.</P>
              <P>(2) The overall classification marking string for every bulletin board or blog shall reflect the overall classification markings for the highest level of information allowed in that space. Linear text appearing on both the top and bottom of the page is acceptable.</P>

              <P>(3) Subject lines of bulletin board postings, blog entries, or comments shall be portion marked to reflect the sensitivity of the information in the <PRTPAGE P="447"/>subject line itself, not the content of the post.</P>
              <P>(4) The overall classification marking string for the bulletin board posting, blog entry, or comment shall reflect the classification markings for the subject line, the text of the posting, and any other information in the posting. These strings shall be entered manually or utilizing an electronic classification tool in the first line of text and at the end of the body of the posting. These strings may appear as single linear text.</P>
              <P>(5) Bulletin board postings, blog entries, or comments shall be portion marked. Each portion shall be marked to reflect the highest level of information contained in that portion.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Marking classified wikis.</E> (1) Initial wiki submissions shall include the overall classification marking string, portion marking, and the classification authority block string in the same manner as mentioned above for bulletin boards and blogs. All of these strings may appear as single line text.</P>
              <P>(2) When users modify existing entries which alter the classification level of the content or add new content, they shall change the required markings to reflect the classification markings for the resulting information. Systems shall provide a means to log the identity of each user, the changes made, and the time and date of each change.</P>
              <P>(3) Wiki articles and entries shall be portion marked. Each portion shall be marked to reflect the highest level of information contained in that portion.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Instant messaging, chat, and chat rooms.</E> (1) Instant messages and chat conversations generally consist of brief textual messages but may also include URLs, images, or graphics. Chat discussions captured for retention or printing shall be marked at the top and bottom of each page with the overall classification reflecting all of the information within the discussion and, for classified discussions, portion markings and the classification authority block string shall also appear.</P>
              <P>(2) Chat rooms shall display system-high overall classification markings and shall contain instructions informing users that the information may not be used as a source for derivative classification unless it is portion marked, contains an overall classification marking, and a classification authority block.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Attached files.</E> When files are attached to another electronic message or document, the overall classification of the message or document shall account for the classification level of the attachment and the message or document shall be marked in accordance with § 2001.24(b).</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Foreign government information.</E> Unless otherwise evident, documents that contain foreign government information should include the marking, “This Document Contains (indicate country of origin) Information.” Agencies may also require that the portions of the documents that contain the foreign government information be marked to indicate the government and classification level, using accepted country code standards, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> “(Country code—C).” If the identity of the specific government must be concealed, the document shall be marked, “This Document Contains Foreign Government Information,” and pertinent portions shall be marked “FGI” together with the classification level, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> “(FGI-C).” In such cases, a separate record that identifies the foreign government shall be maintained in order to facilitate subsequent declassification actions. If the fact that information is foreign government information must be concealed, the markings described in this paragraph shall not be <PRTPAGE P="448"/>used and the document shall be marked as if it were wholly of U.S. origin. When classified records are transferred to NARA for storage or archival purposes, the accompanying documentation shall, at a minimum, identify the boxes that contain foreign government information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Working papers.</E> A working paper is defined as documents or materials, regardless of the media, which are expected to be revised prior to the preparation of a finished product for dissemination or retention. Working papers containing classified information shall be dated when created, marked with the highest classification of any information contained in them, protected at that level, and if otherwise appropriate, destroyed when no longer needed. When any of the following conditions applies, working papers shall be controlled and marked in the same manner prescribed for a finished document at the same classification level:</P>
              <P>(1) Released by the originator outside the originating activity;</P>
              <P>(2) Retained more than 180 days from the date of origin; or</P>
              <P>(3) Filed permanently.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other material.</E> Bulky material, equipment, and facilities, etc., shall be clearly identified in a manner that leaves no doubt about the classification status of the material, the level of protection required, and the duration of classification. Upon a finding that identification would itself reveal classified information, such identification is not required. Supporting documentation for such a finding must be maintained in the appropriate security facility.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Unmarked materials.</E> Information contained in unmarked records, or presidential or related materials, and which pertains to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States, created, maintained, and protected as classified information under prior orders shall continue to be treated as classified information under the Order, and is subject to its provisions regarding declassification.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Classification by compilation/aggregation.</E> Compilation of items that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information meets the standards established in section 1.2 of the Order and reveals an additional association or relationship, as determined by the original classification authority. Any unclassified portions will be portion marked (U), while the overall markings will reflect the classification of the compiled information even if all the portions are marked (U). In any such situation, clear instructions must appear with the compiled information as to the circumstances under which the individual portions constitute a classified compilation, and when they do not.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Commingling of Restricted Data (RD) and Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) with information classified under the Order.</E> (1) To the extent practicable, the commingling in the same document of RD or FRD with information classified under the Order should be avoided. When it is not practicable to avoid such commingling, the marking requirements in the Order and this Directive, as well as the marking requirements in 10 CFR part 1045, <E T="03">Nuclear Classification and Declassification,</E> must be followed.</P>
              <P>(2) Automatic declassification of documents containing RD or FRD is prohibited. Documents marked as containing RD or FRD are excluded from the automatic declassification provisions of the Order until the RD or FRD designation is properly removed by the Department of Energy. When the Department of Energy determines that an RD or FRD designation may be removed, any remaining information classified under the Order must be referred to the appropriate agency in accordance with the declassification provisions of the Order and this Directive.</P>
              <P>(3) For commingled documents, the “Declassify On” line required by the Order and this Directive shall not include a declassification date or event and shall instead be annotated with “Not Applicable (or N/A) to RD/FRD portions” and “See source list for NSI portions.” The source list, as described in § 2001.22(c)(1)(ii), shall include the declassification instruction for each of the source documents classified under the Order and shall not appear on the front page of the document.</P>

              <P>(4) If an RD or FRD portion is extracted for use in a new document, the <PRTPAGE P="449"/>requirements of 10 CFR part 1045 must be followed.</P>
              <P>(5) If a portion classified under the Order is extracted for use in a new document, the requirements of the Order and this Directive must be followed. The declassification date for the extracted portion shall be determined by using the source list required by § 2001.22(c)(1)(ii), the pertinent classification guide, or consultation with the original classification authority with jurisdiction for the information. However, if a commingled document is not portion marked, it shall not be used as a source for a derivatively classified document.</P>
              <P>(6) If a commingled document is not portion marked based on appropriate authority, annotating the source list with the declassification instructions and including the “Declassify on” line in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section are not required. The lack of declassification instructions does not eliminate the requirement to process commingled documents for declassification in accordance with the Order, this Directive, the Atomic Energy Act, or 10 CFR part 1045 when they are requested under statute or the Order.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Transclassified Foreign Nuclear Information (TFNI).</E> (1) As permitted under 42 U.S.C. 2162(e), the Department of Energy shall remove from the Restricted Data category such information concerning the atomic energy programs of other nations as the Secretary of Energy and the Director of National Intelligence jointly determine to be necessary to carry out the provisions of 50 U.S.C. 403 and 403-1 and safeguarded under applicable Executive orders as “National Security Information” under a process called transclassification.</P>
              <P>(2) When Restricted Data information is transclassified and is safeguarded as “National Security Information,” it shall be handled, protected, and classified in conformity with the provisions of the Order and this Directive. Such information shall be labeled as “TFNI” and with any additional identifiers prescribed by the Department of Energy. The label “TFNI” shall be included on documents to indicate the information's transclassification from the Restricted Data category and its declassification process governed by the Secretary of Energy under the Atomic Energy Act.</P>
              <P>(3) Automatic declassification of documents containing TFNI is prohibited. Documents marked as containing TFNI are excluded from the automatic declassification provisions of the Order until the TFNI designation is properly removed by the Department of Energy. When the Department of Energy determines that a TFNI designation may be removed, any remaining information classified under the Order must be referred to the appropriate agency in accordance with the declassification provisions of the Order and this Directive.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Approved dissemination control and handling markings.</E> (1) Dissemination control and handling markings identify the expansion or limitation on the distribution of the information. These markings are in addition to, and separate from, the level of classification.</P>
              <P>(2) Only those external dissemination control and handling markings approved by ISOO or, with respect to the Intelligence Community by the Director of National Intelligence for intelligence and intelligence-related information, may be used by agencies to control and handle the dissemination of classified information pursuant to agency regulations and to policy directives and guidelines issued under section 5.4(d)(2) and section 6.2(b) of the Order. Such approved markings shall be uniform and binding on all agencies and must be available in a central registry.</P>
              <P>(3) If used, the dissemination control and handling markings will appear at the top and bottom of each page after the level of classification.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Portion marking waivers.</E> (1) An agency head or senior agency official may request a waiver from the portion marking requirement for a specific category of information. Such a request shall be submitted to the Director of ISOO and should include the reasons that the benefits of portion marking are outweighed by other factors. The request must also demonstrate that the requested waiver will not create impediments to information sharing. Statements citing administrative burden alone will ordinarily not be viewed <PRTPAGE P="450"/>as sufficient grounds to support a waiver.</P>
              <P>(2) Any approved portion marking waiver will be temporary with specific expiration dates.</P>
              <P>(3) Requests for portion marking waivers from elements of the Intelligence Community (to include pertinent elements of the Department of Defense) should include a statement of support from the Director of National Intelligence or his or her designee. Requests for portion marking waivers from elements of the Department of Defense (to include pertinent elements of the Intelligence Community) should include a statement of support from the Secretary of Defense or his or her designee. Requests for portion marking waivers from elements of the Department of Homeland Security should include a statement of support from the Secretary of Homeland Security or his or her designee.</P>
              <P>(4) A document not portion marked, based on an ISOO-approved waiver, must contain a warning statement that it may not be used as a source for derivative classification.</P>
              <P>(5) If a classified document that is not portion marked, based on an ISOO-approved waiver, is transmitted outside the originating organization, the document must be portion marked unless otherwise explicitly provided in the waiver approval.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Marking information that has been reclassified.</E> Specific information may only be reclassified if all the conditions of section 1.7(d) of the Order and its implementing directives have been met.</P>
              <P>(1) When taking this action, an original classification authority must include the following markings on the information:</P>
              <P>(i) The level of classification;</P>
              <P>(ii) The identity, by name and position, or by personal identifier of the original classification authority;</P>
              <P>(iii) Declassification instructions;</P>
              <P>(iv) A concise reason for classification, including reference to the applicable classification category from section 1.4 of the Order; and</P>
              <P>(v) The date the reclassification action was taken.</P>
              <P>(2) The original classification authority shall notify all known authorized holders of this action.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Marking of electronic storage media.</E> Classified computer media such as USB sticks, hard drives, CD ROMs, and diskettes shall be marked to indicate the highest overall classification of the information contained within the media.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A uniform security classification system requires that standard markings be applied to declassified information. Except in extraordinary circumstances, or as approved by the Director of ISOO, the marking of declassified information shall not deviate from the following prescribed formats. If declassification markings cannot be affixed to specific information or materials, the originator shall provide holders or recipients of the information with written instructions for marking the information. Markings shall be uniformly and conspicuously applied to leave no doubt about the declassified status of the information and who authorized the declassification.</P>
              <P>(b) The following markings shall be applied to records, or copies of records, regardless of media:</P>
              <P>(1) The word, “Declassified;”</P>

Except for when the exemption pertains to information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or a human intelligence source, or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the revised “Declassify On” line shall also include the new date for declassification as approved by the Panel, not to exceed 50 years from the date of origin of the record. Records that contain information, the release of which should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source, or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, are exempt from automatic declassification at 50 years.</P>

              <P>(2) The pertinent exemptions, using the language of section 3.3(b) of the Order, are:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>25X1: reveal the identity of a confidential human source, a human intelligence source, a relationship with an intelligence or security service of a foreign government or international organization, or a non-human intelligence source; or impair the effectiveness of an intelligence method currently in use, available for use, or under development.</P>
                <P>25X2: reveal information that would assist in the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction;</P>
                <P>25X3: reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or activities;</P>
                <P>25X4: reveal information that would impair the application of state-of-the-art technology within a U.S. weapon system;</P>
                <P>25X5: reveal formally named or numbered U.S. military war plans that remain in effect, or reveal operational or tactical elements of prior plans that are contained in such active plans;</P>
                <P>25X6: reveal information, including foreign government information, that would cause serious harm to relations between the United States and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;</P>
                <P>25X7: reveal information that would impair the current ability of United States Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and other protectees for whom protection services, in the interest of the national security, are authorized;</P>
                <P>25X8: reveal information that would seriously impair current national security emergency preparedness plans or reveal current vulnerabilities of systems, installations, or infrastructures relating to the national security; or</P>
                <P>25X9: violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement that does not permit the automatic or unilateral declassification of information at 25 years.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(3) The pertinent portion of the marking would appear as:</P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>Declassify On: 25X4, 20501001</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(4) Documents should not be marked with a “25X” marking until the agency has been informed that the Panel concurs with the proposed exemption.</P>
              <P>(5) Agencies need not apply a “25X” marking to individual documents contained in a file series exempted from automatic declassification under section 3.3(c) of the Order until the individual document is removed from the file and may only apply such a marking as approved by the Panel under section 3.3(j) of the Order.</P>
              <P>(6) Information containing foreign government information will be marked with a date in the “Declassify On” line that is no more than 25 years from the date of the document unless the originating agency has applied for and received Panel approval to exempt foreign government information from declassification at 25 years. Upon receipt of Panel approval, the agency may use either the 25X6 or 25X9 exemption markings, as appropriate, in the “Declassify On” followed by a date that has also been approved by the Panel. An example might appear as: 25X6, 20600129, or 25X9, 20600627. The marking “subject to treaty or international agreement” is not to be used at any time.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Marking information exempted from automatic declassification at 50 years.</E> Records exempted from automatic declassification at 50 years shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of a year that is no more than 75 years from the date of origin unless an agency head, within five years of that date, proposes to exempt specific information from declassification at 75 years and the proposal is formally approved by the Panel.</P>

              <P>(1) When the information clearly and demonstrably could be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence <PRTPAGE P="452"/>source, the marking shall be “50X1-HUM.”</P>
              <P>(2) When the information clearly and demonstrably could reveal key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the marking shall be “50X2-WMD.”</P>
              <P>(3) In extraordinary cases in which the Panel has approved an exemption from declassification at 50 years under section 3.3(h) of the Order, the same procedures as those under § 2001.26(a) will be followed with the exception that the number “50” will be used in place of the “25.”</P>
              <P>(4) Requests for exemption from automatic declassification at 50 years from elements of the Intelligence Community (to include pertinent elements of the Department of Defense) should include a statement of support from the Director of National Intelligence or his or her designee. Requests for automatic declassification exemptions from elements of the Department of Defense (to include pertinent elements of the Intelligence community) should include a statement of support from the Secretary of Defense or his or her designee. Requests for automatic declassification exemptions from elements of the Department of Homeland Security should include a statement of support from the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security or his or her designee.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Marking information exempted from automatic declassification at 75 years.</E> Records exempted from automatic declassification at 75 years shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that has been formally approved by the Panel.</P>
              <P>(1) Information approved by the Panel as exempt from automatic declassification at 75 years shall be marked “75X” with the appropriate automatic declassification exemption category number followed by the approved declassification date or event.</P>
              <P>(2) Requests for exemption from automatic declassification at 75 years from elements of the Intelligence Community (to include pertinent elements of the Department of Defense) should include a statement of support from the Director of National Intelligence or his or her designee. Requests for automatic declassification exemptions from elements of the Department of Defense (to include pertinent elements of the Intelligence community) should include a statement of support from the Secretary of Defense or his or her designee.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Automatic declassification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> All departments and agencies that have original classification authority or previously had original classification authority, or maintain records determined to be permanently valuable that contain classified national security information, shall comply with the automatic declassification provisions of the Order. All agencies with original classification authority shall cooperate with NARA in managing automatic declassification of accessioned Federal records, presidential papers and records, and donated historical materials under the control of the Archivist.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Presidential papers, materials, and records.</E> The Archivist shall establish procedures for the declassification of presidential, vice-presidential, or White House materials transferred to the legal custody of NARA or maintained in the presidential libraries.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Classified information in the custody of contractors, licensees, certificate holders, or grantees.</E> Pursuant to the provisions of the National Industrial Security Program, agencies must provide security classification/declassification guidance to such entities or individuals who possess classified information. Agencies must also determine if classified Federal records are held by such entities or individuals, and if so, whether they are permanent records of historical value and thus subject to section 3.3 of the Order. Until such a determination has been made by an appropriate agency official, such records shall not be subject to automatic declassification, or destroyed, and shall be safeguarded in accordance with the most recent security classification/declassification guidance provided by the agency.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transferred information.</E> In the case of classified information transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage, <PRTPAGE P="453"/>the receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Unofficially transferred information.</E> In the case of classified information that is not officially transferred as described in paragraph (d) of this section but that originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which there is no successor agency, the agency in possession shall serve as the originating agency and shall be responsible for actions for those records in accordance with section 3.3 of the Order and in consultation with the Director of the National Declassification Center (NDC).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Processing records originated by another agency.</E> When an agency uncovers classified records originated by another agency that appear to meet the criteria for referral according to section 3.3(d) of the Order, the finding agency shall identify those records for referral to the originating agency as described in § 2001.34.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Unscheduled records.</E> Classified information in records that have not been scheduled for disposal or retention by NARA is not subject to section 3.3 of the Order. Classified information in records that become scheduled as permanently valuable when that information is already more than 20 years old shall be subject to the automatic declassification provisions of section 3.3 of the Order five years from the date the records are scheduled. Classified information in records that become scheduled as permanently valuable when that information is less than 20 years old shall be subject to the automatic declassification provisions of section 3.3 of the Order at 25 years.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Temporary records and non-record materials.</E> Classified information contained in records determined not to be permanently valuable or non-record materials shall be processed in accordance with section 3.6(c) of the Order.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Foreign government information.</E> The declassifying agency is the agency that initially received or classified the information. When foreign government information appears to be subject to automatic declassification, the declassifying agency shall determine whether the information is subject to a treaty or international agreement that does not permit automatic or unilateral declassification. The declassifying agency shall also determine if another exemption under section 3.3(b) of the Order, such as the exemption that pertains to United States foreign relations, may apply to the information. If the declassifying agency believes such an exemption may apply, it should consult with any other concerned agencies in making its declassification determination. The declassifying agency or the Department of State, as appropriate, may consult with the foreign government prior to declassification.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Assistance to the Archivist of the United States.</E> Agencies shall consult with the Director of the NDC established in section 3.7 of the Order concerning their automatic declassification programs. At the request of the Archivist, agencies shall cooperate with the Director of the NDC in developing priorities for the declassification of records to ensure that declassification is accomplished efficiently and in a timely manner. Agencies shall consult with NARA and the Director of the NDC before reviewing records in their holdings to ensure that appropriate procedures are established for maintaining the integrity of the records and that NARA receives accurate and sufficient information about agency declassification actions, including metadata and other processing information, when records are accessioned by NARA. This data shall include certification by the agency that the records have been reviewed in accordance with Public Law 105-261, section 3161 governing Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Use of approved declassification guides.</E> Approved declassification guides are the sole basis for the exemption from automatic declassification of specific information as provided in section 3.3(b) of the Order and the sole basis for the continued classification of information under section 3.3(h) of the Order. These guides must be prepared in accordance with section 3.3(j) of the Order and include additional pertinent detail relating to the exemptions described in sections 3.3(b) and 3.3(h) of the Order, and follow the format required of declassification guides as described in § 2001.32. During a review <PRTPAGE P="454"/>under section 3.3 of the Order, it is expected that agencies will use these guides to identify specific information for exemption from automatic declassification. It is further expected that the guides or detailed declassification guidance will be made available to the NDC under section 3.7(b) of the Order and to appropriately cleared individuals of other agencies to support equity recognition.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Automatic declassification date.</E> No later than December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of origin, classified records determined to be permanently valuable shall be automatically declassified unless automatic declassification has been delayed for any reason as provided in § 2001.30(n) and sections 3.3(b) and (c) of the Order. If the date of origin of an individual record cannot be readily determined, the date of original classification shall be used instead.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Exemption from Automatic Declassification at 25, 50, or 75 years.</E> Agencies may propose to exempt from automatic declassification specific information, either by reference to information in specific records, in specific file series of records, or in the form of a declassification guide, in accordance with section 3.3(j) of the Order. Agencies may propose to exempt information within five years of, but not later than one year before the information is subject to automatic declassification. The agency head or senior agency official, within the specified timeframe, shall notify the Director of ISOO, serving as the Executive Secretary of the Panel, of the specific information being proposed for exemption from automatic declassification.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Delays in the onset of automatic declassification</E>—(1) <E T="03">Media that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly.</E> An agency head or senior agency official shall consult with the Director of the NDC before delaying automatic declassification for up to five years for classified information contained in media that make a review for possible declassification more difficult or costly. When determined by NARA or jointly determined by NARA and another agency, the following may be delayed due to the increased difficulty and cost of conducting declassification processing:</P>
              <P>(i) Records requiring extraordinary preservation or conservation treatment, to include reformatting, to preclude damage to the records by declassification processing;</P>
              <P>(ii) Records which pose a potential menace to health, life, or property due to contamination by a hazardous substance; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Electronic media if the media is subject to issues of software or hardware obsolescence or degraded data.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Referred records.</E> Records containing classified information that originated with other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests or activities of other agencies and could reasonably be expected to fall under one or more of the exemption categories of section 3.3(b) of the Order shall be identified prior to the onset of automatic declassification for later referral to those agencies. Declassification reviewers shall be trained periodically on other agency equities to aid in the proper identification of other agency equities eligible for referral.</P>
              <P>(i) Information properly identified as a referral to another agency contained in records accessioned by NARA or in the custody of the presidential libraries shall be subject to automatic declassification only after the referral has been made available by NARA for agency review in accordance with § 2001.34, provided the information has not otherwise been properly exempted by an equity holding agency under section 3.3 of the Order.</P>
              <P>(ii) Information properly identified as a referral to another agency contained in records maintained in the physical, but not legal, custody of NARA shall be subject to automatic declassification after accessioning and in accordance with § 2001.34, provided the information has not otherwise been properly exempted by an equity holding agency under section 3.3 of the Order.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Newly discovered records.</E> An agency head or senior agency official must consult with the Director of ISOO on any decision to delay automatic declassification of newly discovered records no later than 90 days, from the <PRTPAGE P="455"/>discovery of the records. The notification shall identify the records, their volume, the anticipated date for declassification, and the circumstances of the discovery. An agency may be granted up to three years from the date of discovery to make a declassification, exemption, or referral determination. If referrals to other agencies are properly identified, they will be handled in accordance with subparagraphs 2(i) and 2(ii) above.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Integral file blocks.</E> Classified records within an integral file block that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under section 3.3 of the Order shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block. For purposes of automatic declassification, integral file blocks shall contain only records dated within ten years of the oldest record in the file block. Integral file blocks applied prior to December 29, 2009, that cover more than ten years remain in effect until December 31, 2012, unless an agency requests an extension from the Director of ISOO on a case-by-case basis prior to December 31, 2011, which is subsequently approved.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">File series exemptions.</E> Agencies seeking to delay the automatic declassification of a specific series of records as defined in section 6.1(r) of the Order because it almost invariably contains information that falls within one or more of the exemption categories under section 3.3(b) must submit their request in accordance with section 3.3(c) of the Order to the Director of ISOO, serving as Executive Secretary of the Panel, at least one year prior to the onset of automatic declassification. Once approved by the Panel, the records in the file series exemption remain subject to section 3.5 of the Order. This delay applies only to records within the specific file series. Copies of records within the specific file series or records of a similar topic to the specific file series located elsewhere may be exempted in accordance with exemptions approved by the Panel.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Redaction standard.</E> Agencies are encouraged but are not required to redact documents that contain information that is exempt from automatic declassification under section 3.3 of the Order, especially if the information that must remain classified comprises a relatively small portion of the document. Any such redactions shall be performed in accordance with policies and procedures established in accordance with § 2001.45(d).</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.</E> (1) Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data are excluded from the automatic declassification requirements in section 3.3 of the Order because they are classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Restricted Data concerns:</P>
              <P>(i) The design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons;</P>
              <P>(ii) The production of special nuclear material, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> enriched uranium or plutonium; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The use of special nuclear material in the production of energy.</P>
              <P>(2) Formerly Restricted Data is information that is still classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, but which has been removed from the Restricted Data category because it is related primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons.</P>
              <P>(3) Any document marked as containing Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data or identified as potentially containing unmarked Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data shall be referred to the Department of Energy in accordance with § 2001.34(b)(8).</P>

              <P>(4) Automatic declassification of documents containing Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data is prohibited. Documents marked as containing Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data are excluded from the automatic declassification provisions of the Order until the Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data designation is properly removed by the Department of Energy. When the Department of Energy determines that a Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data designation may be removed, any remaining information classified under the Order must be referred to the appropriate agency in accordance with the declassification provisions of the Order and this Directive.<PRTPAGE P="456"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Any document containing information concerning foreign nuclear programs that was removed from the Restricted Data category in order to carry out provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, shall be referred to the Department of Energy.</P>

              <P>(6) The Secretary of Energy shall determine when information concerning foreign nuclear programs that was removed from the Restricted Data category in order to carry out the provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, may be declassified. Unless otherwise determined, information concerning foreign nuclear programs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> intelligence assessments or reports, foreign nuclear program information provided to the U.S. Government) shall be declassified when comparable information concerning the United States nuclear program is declassified. When the Secretary of Energy determines that information concerning foreign nuclear programs may be declassified, any remaining information classified under the Order must be referred to the appropriate agency in accordance with the declassification provisions of the Order and this Directive.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Preparation of declassification guides.</E> Beginning one year after the effective date of this directive, declassification guides must be submitted to the Director of ISOO, serving as the Executive Secretary of the Panel, at least one year prior to the onset of automatic declassification for approval by the Panel. Currently approved guides remain in effect until a new guide is approved, to the extent they are otherwise applied consistent with section 3.3(b) of the Order. The information to be exempted must be narrowly defined, with sufficient specificity to allow the user to identify the information with precision. Exemptions must be based upon specific content and not type of document. Exemptions for general categories of information are not acceptable. Agencies must prepare guides that clearly delineate between the exemptions proposed under sections 3.3(b), 3.3(h)(1) and (2), and 3.3(h)(3).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General content of declassification guides.</E> Declassification guides must be specific and detailed as to the information requiring continued classification and clearly and demonstrably explain the reasons for continued classification. Declassification guides shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Be submitted by the agency head or the designated senior agency official;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide the date of issuance or last review;</P>
              <P>(3) State precisely the information that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic declassification and to specifically declassify;</P>
              <P>(4) Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic declassification pursuant to section 3.3(c) of the Order; and</P>
              <P>(5) To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification provisions in section 3.3 of the Order, state precisely the elements of information to be exempted from declassification to include:</P>
              <P>(i) The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, if appropriate, section 3.3(h) of the Order; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A date or event for declassification that is in accordance with section 3.3(b) or section 3.3(h).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Internal review and update.</E> Agency declassification guides shall be reviewed and updated as circumstances require, but at least once every five years. Each agency shall maintain a list of its declassification guides in use.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Dissemination of guides.</E> (1) Declassification guides shall be disseminated within the agency to be used by all personnel with declassification review responsibilities.</P>

              <P>(2) Declassification guides or detailed declassification guidance shall be submitted to the Director of the NDC in <PRTPAGE P="457"/>accordance with section 3.7(b)(3) of the Order.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mandatory review for declassification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">U.S. originated information</E>—(1) <E T="03">Regulations.</E> Each agency shall publish, and update as needed or required, in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> regulations concerning the handling of mandatory declassification review requests, to include the identity of the person(s) or office(s) to which requests should be addressed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Processing</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requests for classified records in the custody of the originating agency.</E> A valid mandatory declassification review request must be of sufficient specificity to allow agency personnel to locate the records containing the information sought with a reasonable amount of effort. Requests for broad types of information, entire file series of records, or similar non-specific requests may be denied by agencies for processing under this section. In responding to mandatory declassification review requests, agencies shall make a final determination within one year from the date of receipt. When information cannot be declassified in its entirety, agencies shall make reasonable efforts to release, consistent with other applicable laws, those declassified portions of the requested information that constitute a coherent segment. Upon denial, in whole or in part, of an initial request, the agency shall also notify the requestor of the right of an administrative appeal, which must be filed within 60 days of receipt of the denial. Agencies receiving mandatory review requests are expected to conduct a line-by-line review of the record(s) for public access and are expected to release the information to the requestor, unless that information is prohibited from release under the provisions of a statutory authority, such as, but not limited to, the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), as amended, the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (44 U.S.C. 2201-2207), or the National Security Act of 1947 (Pub. L. 235, 61 Stat. 496, 50 U.S.C. Chapter 15).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Requests for classified records in the custody of an agency other than the originating agency.</E> When an agency receives a mandatory declassification review request for records in its possession that were originated by another agency, it shall refer the request and the pertinent records to the originating agency. However, if the originating agency has previously agreed that the custodial agency may review its records, the custodial agency shall review the requested records in accordance with declassification guides or guidelines provided by the originating agency. Upon receipt of a request from the referring agency, the originating agency shall promptly process the request for declassification and release in accordance with this section. The originating agency shall communicate its declassification determination to the referring agency. The referring agency is responsible for collecting all agency review results and informing the requestor of any final decision regarding the declassification of the requested information unless a prior arrangement has been made with the originating agency.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Appeals of denials of mandatory declassification review requests.</E> The agency appellate authority shall normally make a determination within 60 working days following the receipt of an appeal. If additional time is required to make a determination, the agency appellate authority shall notify the requester of the additional time needed and provide the requester with the reason for the extension.

The declassifying agency is the agency that initially received or classified the information. When foreign government information is being considered for declassification, the declassifying agency shall determine whether the information is subject to a treaty or international agreement that does not permit automatic or unilateral declassification. The declassifying agency or the Department of State, as appropriate, may consult with the foreign government(s) prior to declassification.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Referrals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Referrals are required under sections 3.3(d)(3) and 3.6(b) of the Order in order to ensure the timely, efficient, and effective processing of reviews and requests and in order to protect classified information from inadvertent disclosure.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Automatic declassification.</E> The referral process for records subject to automatic declassification entails identification of records containing classified information that originated with other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests or activities of other agencies. Those records that could reasonably be expected to fall under one or more of the exemptions in section 3.3(b) of the Order are eligible for referral. The referral process also entails formal notification to those agencies, making the records available for review by those agencies, and recording final agency determinations.<PRTPAGE P="459"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) In accordance with section 3.3(d)(3) of the Order, the identification of records eligible for referral is the responsibility of the primary reviewing agency and shall be completed prior to the date of automatic declassification established by section 3.3(a) of the Order.</P>

              <P>(2) Except as otherwise determined by the Director of the NDC, primary reviewing agencies shall utilize the Standard Form 715, <E T="03">Government Declassification Review Tab,</E> to tab and identify any Federal record requiring referral and record the referral in a manner that provides the referral information in an NDC database system.</P>
              <P>(3) Notification of referral of records accessioned into NARA or in the custody of the presidential libraries, and making the records available for review, is the responsibility of NARA and shall be accomplished through the NDC.</P>
              <P>(4) Within 180 days of the effective date of this provision, the NDC shall develop and provide the affected agencies with a comprehensive and prioritized schedule for the resolution of referrals contained in accessioned Federal records and Presidential records. The schedule shall be developed in consultation with the affected agencies, consider the public interest in the records, and be in accordance with the authorized delays to automatic declassification set forth in section 3.3(d) of the Order. The initial schedule shall cover the balance of the first effective fiscal year and four subsequent fiscal years. Thereafter, the schedule shall cover five fiscal years. The NDC shall consult with the affected agencies and update and provide such schedules annually.</P>
              <P>(5) The NDC shall provide formal notification of the availability of a referral to the receiving agency and records will be subject to automatic declassification in accordance with the schedule promulgated by the NDC in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, unless the information has been properly exempted by an equity holding agency under section 3.3 of the Order.</P>
              <P>(6) Records in the physical but not legal custody of NARA shall be subject to automatic declassification after accessioning and in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) Agencies that establish a centralized facility as described in section 3.7(e) may make direct referrals provided such activities fall within the priorities and schedule established by the NDC and the activity is otherwise coordinated with the NDC. In such cases, the centralized facility is responsible for providing formal notification of a referral to receiving agencies and for making the records available for review or direct formal referral to agencies by providing a copy of the records unless another mechanism is identified in coordination with the NDC. As established in section 3.3(d)(3)(B), referrals to agencies from a centralized agency records facility as described in section 3.7(e) of the Order will be automatically declassified up to three years after the formal notification has been made, if the receiving agency fails to provide a final determination.</P>
              <P>(8) Records marked as containing Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data or identified as potentially containing unmarked Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data shall be referred to the Department of Energy through the NDC. If the Department of Energy confirms that the document contains Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data, it shall then be excluded from the automatic declassification provisions of the Order until the Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data designation is properly removed.</P>
              <P>(i) When the Department of Energy provides notification that a Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data designation is not appropriate or when it is properly removed, the record shall be processed for automatic declassification through the NDC.</P>
              <P>(ii) In all cases, should the record be the subject of an access demand made pursuant to the Order or provision of law, the information classified pursuant to Executive order (rather than the Atomic Energy Act, as amended) must stand on its own merits.</P>

              <P>(9) The NDC, as well as any centralized agency facility established under section 3.7(e) of the Order, shall track <PRTPAGE P="460"/>and document referral actions and decisions in a manner that facilitates archival processing for public access. Central agency facilities must work with the NDC to ensure documentation meets NDC requirements, and transfer all documentation on pending referral actions and referral decisions to the NDC when transferring the records to NARA.</P>
              <P>(10) In all cases, receiving agencies shall acknowledge receipt of formal referral notifications in a timely manner. If a disagreement arises concerning referral notifications, the Director of ISOO will determine the automatic declassification date and notify the senior agency official, as well as the NDC or the primary reviewing agency.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Remote Archives Capture (RAC).</E> Presidential records or materials scanned in the RAC process shall be prioritized and scheduled for review by the NDC. The initial notification shall be made to the agency with primary equity, which shall have up to one year to act on its information and to identify all other equities eligible for referral. All such additional referrals in an individual record shall be made at the same time, and once notified by the NDC of an eligible referral, such receiving agencies shall have up to one year to review the records before the onset of automatic declassification.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Agencies eligible to receive referrals.</E> The Director of ISOO will publish annually a list of those agencies eligible to receive referrals for each calendar year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Systematic declassification review.</E> The identification of equities shall be accomplished in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Priorities for review will be established by the NDC.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Identification of interests other than national security.</E> Referrals under sections 3.3(d)(3) and 3.6(b) of the Order shall be assumed to be intended for later public release unless withholding is otherwise authorized and warranted under applicable law. If a receiving agency proposes to withhold any such information, it must notify the referring agency at the time they otherwise respond to the referral. Such notification shall identify the specific information at issue and the pertinent law.</P>

When alternative measures are used for other than temporary, unique situations, the alternative measures shall be documented and provided to the Director of ISOO. Upon request, the description shall be provided to any other agency with which classified information or secure facilities are shared. In all cases, the alternative measures shall provide protection sufficient to reasonably deter and detect loss or unauthorized disclosure. Risk management factors considered will include sensitivity, value, and crucial nature of the information; analysis of known and anticipated threats; vulnerability; and countermeasure benefits versus cost.</P>
              <P>(c) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) classified information shall be safeguarded in compliance with U.S. Security Authority for NATO Instruction (USSAN) 1-07. Other foreign government information shall be safeguarded as described herein for U.S. information except as required by an existing treaty, agreement or other obligation (hereinafter, obligation). When the information is to be safeguarded pursuant to an existing obligation, the additional requirements at § 2001.54 may apply to the extent they were required in the obligation as originally negotiated or are agreed upon during amendment. Negotiations on new obligations or amendments to existing obligations shall strive to bring provisions for safeguarding foreign government information into accord with standards for safeguarding U.S. information as described in this Directive.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Need-to-know determinations.</E> (1) Agency heads, through their designees, shall identify organizational missions and personnel requiring access to classified information to perform or assist in authorized governmental functions.

              <SUBJECT>Transmission.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Classified information shall be transmitted and received in an authorized manner which ensures that evidence of tampering can be detected, that inadvertent access can be precluded, and that provides a method which assures timely delivery to the intended recipient. Persons transmitting classified information are responsible for ensuring that intended recipients are authorized persons with the capability to store classified information in accordance with this Directive.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Dispatch.</E> Agency heads shall establish procedures which ensure that:</P>
              <P>(1) All classified information physically transmitted outside facilities shall be enclosed in two layers, both of which provide reasonable evidence of tampering and which conceal the contents. The inner enclosure shall clearly identify the address of both the sender and the intended recipient, the highest classification level of the contents, and any appropriate warning notices. The outer enclosure shall be the same except that no markings to indicate that the contents are classified shall be visible. Intended recipients shall be identified by name only as part of an attention line. The following exceptions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) If the classified information is an internal component of a packable item of equipment, the outside shell or body may be considered as the inner enclosure provided it does not reveal classified information;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the classified information is an inaccessible internal component of a bulky item of equipment, the outside or body of the item may be considered to be a sufficient enclosure provided observation of it does not reveal classified information;</P>
              <P>(iii) If the classified information is an item of equipment that is not reasonably packable and the shell or body is classified, it shall be concealed with an opaque enclosure that will hide all classified features;</P>
              <P>(iv) Specialized shipping containers, including closed cargo transporters or diplomatic pouch, may be considered the outer enclosure when used; and</P>
              <P>(v) When classified information is hand-carried outside a facility, a locked briefcase may serve as the outer enclosure.</P>

              <P>(2) Couriers and authorized persons designated to hand-carry classified information shall ensure that the information remains under their constant and continuous protection and that direct point-to-point delivery is made. As an exception, agency heads may approve, as a substitute for a courier on <PRTPAGE P="465"/>direct flights, the use of specialized shipping containers that are of sufficient construction to provide evidence of forced entry, are secured with a combination padlock meeting Federal Specification FF-P-110, are equipped with an electronic seal that would provide evidence of surreptitious entry and are handled by the carrier in a manner to ensure that the container is protected until its delivery is completed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Transmission methods within and between the U.S., Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trust territory</E>—(1) <E T="03">Top Secret.</E> Top Secret information shall be transmitted by direct contact between authorized persons; the Defense Courier Service or an authorized government agency courier service; a designated courier or escort with Top Secret clearance; electronic means over approved communications systems. Under no circumstances will Top Secret information be transmitted via the U.S. Postal Service or any other cleared or uncleared commercial carrier.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Secret.</E> Secret information shall be transmitted by:</P>
              <P>(i) Any of the methods established for Top Secret; U.S. Postal Service Express Mail and U.S. Postal Service Registered Mail, as long as the Waiver of Signature block on the U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Label shall not be completed; and cleared commercial carriers or cleared commercial messenger services. The use of street-side mail collection boxes is strictly prohibited; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Agency heads may, when a requirement exists for overnight delivery within the U.S. and its Territories, authorize the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for overnight delivery of information for the Executive Branch as long as applicable postal regulations (39 CFR. Chapter I) are met. Any such delivery service shall be U.S. owned and operated, provide automated in-transit tracking of the classified information, and ensure package integrity during transit. The contract shall require cooperation with government inquiries in the event of a loss, theft, or possible unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available to receive the delivery and verification of the correct mailing address. The package may be addressed to the recipient by name. The release signature block on the receipt label shall not be executed under any circumstances. The use of external (street side) collection boxes is prohibited. Classified Communications Security Information, NATO, and foreign government information shall not be transmitted in this manner.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Confidential.</E> Confidential information shall be transmitted by any of the methods established for Secret information or U.S. Postal Service Certified Mail. In addition, when the recipient is a U.S. Government facility, the Confidential information may be transmitted via U.S. First Class Mail. However, Confidential information shall not be transmitted to government contractor facilities via first class mail. When first class mail is used, the envelope or outer wrapper shall be marked to indicate that the information is not to be forwarded, but is to be returned to sender. The use of streetside mail collection boxes is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transmission methods to a U.S. Government facility located outside the U.S.</E> The transmission of classified information to a U.S. Government facility located outside the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trust territory, shall be by methods specified above for Top Secret information or by the Department of State Courier Service. U.S. Registered Mail through Military Postal Service facilities may be used to transmit Secret and Confidential information provided that the information does not at any time pass out of U.S. citizen control nor pass through a foreign postal system.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Transmission of U.S. classified information to foreign governments.</E> Such transmission shall take place between designated government representatives using the government-to-government transmission methods described in paragraph (d) of this section or through channels agreed to by the National Security Authorities of the two governments. When classified information is transferred to a foreign government or <PRTPAGE P="466"/>its representative a signed receipt is required.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Receipt of classified information.</E> Agency heads shall establish procedures which ensure that classified information is received in a manner which precludes unauthorized access, provides for inspection of all classified information received for evidence of tampering and confirmation of contents, and ensures timely acknowledgment of the receipt of Top Secret and Secret information by an authorized recipient. As noted in paragraph (e) of this section, a receipt acknowledgment of all classified material transmitted to a foreign government or its representative is required.</P>

              <P>The requirements described below are additional baseline safeguarding standards that may be necessary for foreign government information, other than NATO information, that requires protection pursuant to an existing treaty, agreement, bilateral exchange or other obligation. NATO classified information shall be safeguarded in compliance with USSAN 1-07. To the extent practical, and to facilitate its control, foreign government information should be stored separately from other classified information. To avoid additional costs, separate storage may be accomplished by methods such as separate drawers of a container. The safeguarding standards described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section may be modified if required or permitted by treaties or agreements, or for other obligations, with the prior written consent of the National Security Authority of the originating government, hereafter “originating government.”</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Top Secret.</E> Records shall be maintained of the receipt, internal distribution, destruction, access, reproduction, and transmittal of foreign government Top Secret information. Reproduction requires the consent of the originating government. Destruction will be witnessed.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Restricted and other foreign government information provided in confidence.</E> In order to assure the protection of other foreign government information provided in confidence (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> foreign government “Restricted,” “Designated,” or unclassified provided in confidence), such information must be classified under the Order. The receiving agency, or a receiving U.S. contractor, licensee, grantee, or certificate holder acting in accordance with instructions received from the U.S. Government, shall provide a degree of protection to the foreign government information at least equivalent to that <PRTPAGE P="469"/>required by the government or international organization that provided the information. When adequate to achieve equivalency, these standards may be less restrictive than the safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to U.S. Confidential information. If the foreign protection requirement is lower than the protection required for U.S. Confidential information, the following requirements shall be met:</P>
              <P>(1) Documents may retain their original foreign markings if the responsible agency determines that these markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings. Otherwise, documents shall be marked, “This document contains (insert name of country) (insert classification level) information to be treated as U.S. (insert classification level).” The notation, “Modified Handling Authorized,” may be added to either the foreign or U.S. markings authorized for foreign government information. If remarking foreign originated documents or matter is impractical, an approved cover sheet is an authorized option;</P>
              <P>(2) Documents shall be provided only to persons in accordance with sections 4.1(a) and (h) of the Order;</P>
              <P>(3) Individuals being given access shall be notified of applicable handling instructions. This may be accomplished by a briefing, written instructions, or by applying specific handling requirements to an approved cover sheet;</P>
              <P>(4) Documents shall be stored in such a manner so as to prevent unauthorized access;</P>
              <P>(5) Documents shall be transmitted in a method approved for classified information, unless this method is waived by the originating government.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Third-country transfers.</E> The release or disclosure of foreign government information to any third-country entity must have the prior consent of the originating government if required by a treaty, agreement, bilateral exchange, or other obligation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prescribed standard forms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The purpose of the standard forms is to promote the implementation of the government-wide information security program. Standard forms are prescribed when their use will enhance the protection of national security information and/or will reduce the costs associated with its protection. The use of the standard forms prescribed is mandatory for agencies of the executive branch that create or handle national security information. As appropriate, these agencies may mandate the use of these forms by their contractors, licensees, or grantees who are authorized access to national security information.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Waivers.</E> Except for the SF 312, “Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement,” and the SF 714, “Financial Disclosure Report,” (which are waiverable by the Director of National Intelligence, as the Security Executive Agent, under E.O. 13467, <E T="03">Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified National Security Information</E>) only the Director of ISOO may grant a waiver from the use of the prescribed standard forms. To apply for a waiver, an agency must submit its proposed alternative form to the Director of ISOO along with its justification for use. The Director of ISOO will review the request and notify the agency of the decision. Waivers approved prior to December 29, 2009, remain in effect and are subject to review.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Availability.</E> Agencies may obtain copies of the standard forms prescribed by ordering through FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP or from the GSA Consumer Global Supply Centers, or the GSA Advantage on-line service. Some of these standard forms can be downloaded from the GSA Forms Library.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Standard Forms.</E> Standard forms required for application to national security information are as follows.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">SF 311, Agency Security Classification Management Program Data:</E> The SF 311 is a data collection form completed by only those executive branch agencies that create and/or handle classified national security information. The form is a record of classification management data provided by the agencies. The agencies submit the completed forms on an annual basis to ISOO, no later than November 15 following the reporting period, for inclusion in a report to the President.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">SF 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement:</E>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The SF 312 is a nondisclosure agreement between the United States and an employee of the Federal Government or one of its contractors, licensees, or grantees. The prior execution of this form by an individual is necessary before the United States Government may grant that individual access to classified information, with the exception of an emergency as defined in section 4.2(b) of the Order.</P>
              <P>(ii) Electronic signatures on SF-312s are prohibited.</P>
              <P>(iii) The SF 312 is the current authorized form; if an employee originally signed the now outdated SF 189 or SF 189-A, or a form under an approved waiver, as agreement to nondisclosure, the forms remain valid. The SF 189 and SF 189-A are no longer available for use with new employees.</P>
              <P>(iv) The use of the “Security Debriefing Acknowledgement” portion of the SF 312 is optional at the discretion of the implementing agency. If an agency chooses not to record its debriefing by signing/dating the debriefing section of the SF 312, then the agency shall provide an alternative record.</P>
              <P>(v) An authorized representative of a contractor, licensee, grantee, or other non-Government organization, acting as a designated agent of the United States, may witness the execution of the SF 312 by another non-Government employee, and may accept it on behalf of the United States. Also, an employee of a United States agency may witness the execution of the SF 312 by an employee, contractor, licensee, or grantee of another United States agency, provided that an authorized United States Government official or, for non-Government employees only, a designated agent of the United States subsequently accepts by signature the SF 312 on behalf of the United States.</P>

              <P>(vi) The provisions of the SF 312, the SF 189, and the SF 189-A do not supersede the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 2302, <PRTPAGE P="474"/>which pertain to the protected disclosure of information by Government employees, or any other laws of the United States.</P>
              <P>(vii) Each agency must retain its executed copies of the SF 312, SF 189, and SF 189-A in file systems from which an agreement can be expeditiously retrieved in the event that the United States must seek its enforcement or a subsequent employer must confirm its prior execution. The original, or a legally enforceable facsimile that is retained in lieu of the original, such as microfiche, microfilm, computer disk, or electronic storage medium, must be retained for 50 years following its date of execution. For agreements executed by civilian employees of the United States Government, an agency may store the executed copy of the SF 312 and SF 189 in the United States Office of Personnel Management's Official Personnel Folder as a long-term (right side) document for that employee. An agency may permit its contractors, licensees, and grantees to retain the executed agreements of their employees during the time of employment. Upon the termination of employment, the contractors, licensee, or grantee shall deliver the original or legally enforceable facsimile of the executed SF 312, SF 189, or SF 189-A of that employee to the Government agency primarily responsible for his or her classified work. A contractor, licensee, or grantee of an agency participating in the National Industrial Security Program shall provide the copy or legally enforceable facsimile of the executed SF 312, SF 189, or SF 189-A of a terminated employee to their cognizant security office. Each agency shall inform ISOO of the file systems that it uses to store these agreements for each category of affected individuals.</P>
              <P>(viii) Only the Director of National Intelligence, as the Security Executive Agent, may grant an agency's request for a waiver from the use of the SF 312. To apply for a waiver, an agency must submit its proposed alternative nondisclosure agreement to the Director of the Special Security Center (SSC), Office of the Director of National Intelligence, along with a justification for its use. The Director, SSC, shall request a determination about the alternative agreement's enforceability from the Department of Justice.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">SF 700, Security Container Information:</E> The SF 700 provides the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of employees who are to be contacted if the security container to which the form pertains is found open and unattended. The form also includes the means to maintain a current record of the security container's combination and provides the envelope to be used to forward this information to the appropriate agency activity or official. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a security container information form is required, the SF 700 shall be used. Parts 2 and 2A of each completed copy of SF 700 shall be classified at the highest level of classification of the information authorized for storage in the security container. A new SF 700 must be completed each time the combination to the security container is changed. The national stock number for the SF 700 is 7540-01-214-5372.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">SF 701, Activity Security Checklist:</E> The SF 701 provides a systematic means to make a thorough end-of-day security inspection for a particular work area and to allow for employee accountability in the event that irregularities are discovered. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that an activity security checklist is required, the SF 701 will be used. Completion, storage, and disposition of SF 701 will be in accordance with each agency's security regulations. The national stock number for the SF 701 is 7540-01-213-7899.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet:</E> The SF 702 provides a record of the names and times that persons have opened, closed, or checked a particular container that holds classified information.

              <P>(8) <E T="03">SF 705, CONFIDENTIAL Cover Sheet:</E> The SF 705 serves as a shield to protect Confidential classified information from inadvertent disclosure and to alert observers that Confidential information is attached to it. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a CONFIDENTIAL cover sheet is required, the SF 705 will be used. The SF 705 is affixed to the top of the Confidential document and remains attached until the document is destroyed. When the SF 705 has been appropriately removed, it may, depending upon its condition, be reused. The national stock number of the SF 704 is 7540-01-213-7903.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">SF 706, TOP SECRET Label:</E> The SF 706 is used to identify and protect electronic media and other media that contain Top Secret information. The SF 706 is used instead of the SF 703 for media other than documents. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a TOP SECRET label is required, the SF 706 will be used. The SF 706 is affixed to the medium containing Top Secret information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. The national stock number of the SF 706 is 7540-01-207-5536.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">SF 707, SECRET Label:</E> The SF 707 is used to identify and protect electronic media and other media that contain Secret information. The SF 707 is used instead of the SF 704 for media other than documents. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a SECRET label is required, the SF 707 will be used. The SF 707 is affixed to the medium containing Secret information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. The national stock number of the SF 707 is 7540-01-207-5537.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">SF 708, CONFIDENTIAL Label:</E> The SF 708 is used to identify and protect electronic media and other media that contain Confidential information. The SF 708 is used instead of the SF 705 for media other than documents. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a CONFIDENTIAL label is required, the SF 708 will be used. The SF 708 is affixed to the medium containing Confidential information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. The national stock number of the SF 708 is 7540-01-207-5538.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">SF 709, CLASSIFIED Label:</E> The SF 709 is used to identify and protect electronic media and other media that contain classified information pending a determination by the classifier of the specific classification level of the information. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a CLASSIFIED label is required, the SF 709 will be used. The SF 709 is affixed to the medium containing classified information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of <PRTPAGE P="476"/>equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. When a classifier has made a determination of the specific level of classification of the information contained on the medium, either the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 shall be affixed on top of the SF 709 so that only the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 is visible. The national stock number of the SF 709 is 7540-01-207-5540.</P>
              <P>(13) <E T="03">SF 710, UNCLASSIFIED Label:</E> In a mixed environment in which classified and unclassified information are being processed or stored, the SF 710 is used to identify electronic media and other media that contain unclassified information. Its function is to aid in distinguishing among those media that contain either classified or unclassified information in a mixed environment. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that an UNCLASSIFIED label is required, the SF 710 will be used. The SF 710 is affixed to the medium containing unclassified information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. However, the label is small enough so that it can be wholly covered by a SF 706, SF 707, SF 708, or SF 709 if the medium subsequently contains classified information. The national stock number of the SF 710 is 7540-01-207-5539.</P>
              <P>(14) <E T="03">SF 711, DATA DESCRIPTOR Label:</E> The SF 711 is used to identify additional safeguarding controls that pertain to classified information that is stored or contained on electronic or other media.

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part describes the executive branch's Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program (the CUI Program) and establishes policy for designating, handling, and decontrolling information that qualifies as CUI.</P>

              <P>(b) The CUI Program standardizes the way the executive branch handles information that requires protection under laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies, but that does not qualify as classified under Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information, December 29, 2009 (3 CFR, 2010 Comp., p. 298), or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as amended.</P>
              <P>(c) All unclassified information throughout the executive branch that requires any safeguarding or dissemination control is CUI. Law, regulation (to include this part), or Government-wide policy must require or permit such controls. Agencies therefore may not implement safeguarding or dissemination controls for any unclassified information other than those controls consistent with the CUI Program.</P>

              <P>(d) Prior to the CUI Program, agencies often employed <E T="03">ad hoc,</E> agency-specific policies, procedures, and markings to handle this information. This patchwork approach caused agencies to mark and handle information inconsistently, implement unclear or unnecessarily restrictive disseminating policies, and create obstacles to sharing information.</P>
              <P>(e) An executive branch-wide CUI policy balances the need to safeguard CUI with the public interest in sharing information appropriately and without unnecessary burdens.</P>

              <P>(f) This part applies to all executive branch agencies that designate or handle information that meets the standards for CUI. This part does not apply directly to non-executive branch entities, but it does apply indirectly to non-executive branch CUI recipients, through incorporation into agreements (see §§ 2002.4(c) and 2002.16(a) for more information).<PRTPAGE P="480"/>

              <P>(g) This part rescinds Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Office Notice 2011-01: Initial Implementation Guidance for Executive Order 13556 (June 9, 2011).</P>
              <P>(h) This part creates no right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</P>

              <P>(i) This part, which contains the CUI Executive Agent (EA)'s control policy, overrides agency-specific or <E T="03">ad hoc</E> requirements when they conflict. This part does not alter, limit, or supersede a requirement stated in laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies or impede the statutory authority of agency heads.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As used in this part:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency</E> (also Federal agency, executive agency, executive branch agency) is any “executive agency,” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105; the United States Postal Service; and any other independent entity within the executive branch that designates or handles CUI.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency CUI policies</E> are the policies the agency enacts to implement the CUI Program within the agency. They must be in accordance with the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry and approved by the CUI EA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreements and arrangements</E> are any vehicle that sets out specific CUI handling requirements for contractors and other information-sharing partners when the arrangement with the other party involves CUI. Agreements and arrangements include, but are not limited to, contracts, grants, licenses, certificates, memoranda of agreement/arrangement or understanding, and information-sharing agreements or arrangements. When disseminating or sharing <PRTPAGE P="481"/>CUI with non-executive branch entities, agencies should enter into written agreements or arrangements that include CUI provisions whenever feasible (see § 2002.16(a)(5) and (6) for details). When sharing information with foreign entities, agencies should enter agreements or arrangements when feasible (see § 2002.16(a)(5)(iii) and (a)(6) for details).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Authorized holder</E> is an individual, agency, organization, or group of users that is permitted to designate or handle CUI, in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Classified information</E> is information that Executive Order 13526, “Classified National Security Information,” December 29, 2009 (3 CFR, 2010 Comp., p. 298), or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires agencies to mark with classified markings and protect against unauthorized disclosure.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Controlled environment</E> is any area or space an authorized holder deems to have adequate physical or procedural controls (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> barriers or managed access controls) to protect CUI from unauthorized access or disclosure.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Control level</E> is a general term that indicates the safeguarding and disseminating requirements associated with CUI Basic and CUI Specified.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Controlled Unclassified Information</E> (CUI) is information the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls. However, CUI does not include classified information (see paragraph (e) of this section) or information a non-executive branch entity possesses and maintains in its own systems that did not come from, or was not created or possessed by or for, an executive branch agency or an entity acting for an agency. Law, regulation, or Government-wide policy may require or permit safeguarding or dissemination controls in three ways: Requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information but providing no specific controls, which makes the information CUI Basic; requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information and providing specific controls for doing so, which makes the information CUI Specified; or requiring or permitting agencies to control the information and specifying only some of those controls, which makes the information CUI Specified, but with CUI Basic controls where the authority does not specify.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Controls</E> are safeguarding or dissemination controls that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits agencies to use when handling CUI. The authority may specify the controls it requires or permits the agency to apply, or the authority may generally require or permit agencies to control the information (in which case, the agency applies controls from the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry).</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">CUI Basic</E> is the subset of CUI for which the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy does not set out specific handling or dissemination controls. Agencies handle CUI Basic according to the uniform set of controls set forth in this part and the CUI Registry. CUI Basic differs from CUI Specified (see definition for CUI Specified in this section), and CUI Basic controls apply whenever CUI Specified ones do not cover the involved CUI.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">CUI categories and subcategories</E> are those types of information for which laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies require or permit agencies to exercise safeguarding or dissemination controls, and which the CUI EA has approved and listed in the CUI Registry. The controls for any CUI Basic categories and any CUI Basic subcategories are the same, but the controls for CUI Specified categories and subcategories can differ from CUI Basic ones and from each other. A CUI category may be Specified, while some or all of its subcategories may not be, and vice versa. If dealing with CUI that falls into a CUI Specified category or subcategory, review the controls for that category or subcategory on the CUI Registry. Also consult the agency's CUI policy for specific direction from the Senior Agency Official.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">CUI category or subcategory markings</E> are the markings approved by the CUI EA for the categories and subcategories listed in the CUI Registry.<PRTPAGE P="482"/>
              </P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">CUI Executive Agent (EA)</E> is the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which implements the executive branch-wide CUI Program and oversees Federal agency actions to comply with the Order. NARA has delegated this authority to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO).</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">CUI Program</E> is the executive branch-wide program to standardize CUI handling by all Federal agencies. The Program includes the rules, organization, and procedures for CUI, established by the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">CUI Program manager</E> is an agency official, designated by the agency head or CUI SAO, to serve as the official representative to the CUI EA on the agency's day-to-day CUI Program operations, both within the agency and in interagency contexts.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">CUI Registry</E> is the online repository for all information, guidance, policy, and requirements on handling CUI, including everything issued by the CUI EA other than this part. Among other information, the CUI Registry identifies all approved CUI categories and subcategories, provides general descriptions for each, identifies the basis for controls, establishes markings, and includes guidance on handling procedures.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">CUI senior agency official (SAO)</E> is a senior official designated in writing by an agency head and responsible to that agency head for implementation of the CUI Program within that agency. The CUI SAO is the primary point of contact for official correspondence, accountability reporting, and other matters of record between the agency and the CUI EA.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">CUI Specified</E> is the subset of CUI in which the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy contains specific handling controls that it requires or permits agencies to use that differ from those for CUI Basic. The CUI Registry indicates which laws, regulations, and Government-wide policies include such specific requirements. CUI Specified controls may be more stringent than, or may simply differ from, those required by CUI Basic; the distinction is that the underlying authority spells out specific controls for CUI Specified information and does not for CUI Basic information. CUI Basic controls apply to those aspects of CUI Specified where the authorizing laws, regulations, and Government-wide policies do not provide specific guidance.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Decontrolling</E> occurs when an authorized holder, consistent with this part and the CUI Registry, removes safeguarding or dissemination controls from CUI that no longer requires such controls. Decontrol may occur automatically or through agency action. See § 2002.18.</P>
              <P>(t) <E T="03">Designating</E>
                <E T="03">CUI</E> occurs when an authorized holder, consistent with this part and the CUI Registry, determines that a specific item of information falls into a CUI category or subcategory. The authorized holder who designates the CUI must make recipients aware of the information's CUI status in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(u) <E T="03">Designating agency</E> is the executive branch agency that designates or approves the designation of a specific item of information as CUI.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Disseminating</E> occurs when authorized holders provide access, transmit, or transfer CUI to other authorized holders through any means, whether internal or external to an agency.</P>
              <P>(w) <E T="03">Document</E> means any tangible thing which constitutes or contains information, and means the original and any copies (whether different from the originals because of notes made on such copies or otherwise) of all writings of every kind and description over which an agency has authority, whether inscribed by hand or by mechanical, facsimile, electronic, magnetic, microfilm, photographic, or other means, as well as phonic or visual reproductions or oral statements, conversations, or events, and including, but not limited to: Correspondence, email, notes, reports, papers, files, manuals, books, pamphlets, periodicals, letters, memoranda, notations, messages, telegrams, cables, facsimiles, records, studies, working papers, accounting papers, contracts, licenses, certificates, grants, agreements, computer disks, computer tapes, telephone logs, computer mail, computer printouts, worksheets, sent or received communications of any kind, teletype messages, agreements, <PRTPAGE P="483"/>diary entries, calendars and journals, printouts, drafts, tables, compilations, tabulations, recommendations, accounts, work papers, summaries, address books, other records and recordings or transcriptions of conferences, meetings, visits, interviews, discussions, or telephone conversations, charts, graphs, indexes, tapes, minutes, contracts, leases, invoices, records of purchase or sale correspondence, electronic or other transcription of taping of personal conversations or conferences, and any written, printed, typed, punched, taped, filmed, or graphic matter however produced or reproduced. Document also includes the file, folder, exhibits, and containers, the labels on them, and any metadata, associated with each original or copy.

              <P>(ee) <E T="03">Misuse of CUI</E> occurs when someone uses CUI in a manner not in accordance with the policy contained in the Order, this part, the CUI Registry, agency CUI policy, or the applicable laws, regulations, and Government-wide policies that govern the affected information. This may include intentional violations or unintentional errors in safeguarding or disseminating CUI. This may also include designating or marking information as CUI when it does not qualify as CUI.</P>

Such entities may include: Elements of the legislative or judicial branches of the Federal Government; state, interstate, tribal, or local government elements; and private organizations. Non-executive branch entity does not include foreign entities as defined in this part, nor does it include individuals or organizations when they receive CUI information pursuant to federal disclosure laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act of 1974.</P>
              <P>(hh) <E T="03">On behalf of an agency</E> occurs when a non-executive branch entity uses or operates an information system or maintains or collects information for the purpose of processing, storing, or transmitting Federal information, and those activities are not incidental to providing a service or product to the Government.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Order</E> is Executive Order 13556, Controlled Unclassified Information, November 4, 2010 (3 CFR, 2011 Comp., p. 267), or any successor order.<PRTPAGE P="484"/>

              <P>(kk) <E T="03">Protection</E> includes all controls an agency applies or must apply when handling information that qualifies as CUI.</P>
              <P>(ll) <E T="03">Public release</E> occurs when the agency that originally designated particular information as CUI makes that information available to the public through the agency's official public release processes. Disseminating CUI to non-executive branch entities as authorized does not constitute public release. Releasing information to an individual pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 or disclosing it in response to a FOIA request also does not automatically constitute public release, although it may if that agency ties such actions to its official public release processes. Even though an agency may disclose some CUI to a member of the public, the Government must still control that CUI unless the agency publicly releases it through its official public release processes.</P>

              <P>(nn) <E T="03">Required or permitted (by a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy)</E> is the basis by which information may qualify as CUI. If a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires that agencies exercise safeguarding or dissemination controls over certain information, or specifically permits agencies the discretion to do so, then that information qualifies as CUI. The term 'specifically permits' in this context can include language such as “is exempt from” applying certain information release or disclosure requirements, “may” release or disclose the information, “may not be required to” release or disclose the information, “is responsible for protecting” the information, and similar specific but indirect, forms of granting the agency discretion regarding safeguarding or dissemination controls. This does not include general agency or agency head authority and discretion to make decisions, risk assessments, or other broad agency authorities, discretions, and powers, regardless of the source.

              <SUBJECT>Safeguarding.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General safeguarding policy.</E> (1) Pursuant to the Order and this part, and in consultation with affected agencies, the CUI EA issues safeguarding standards in this part and, as necessary, in the CUI Registry, updating them as needed. These standards require agencies to safeguard CUI at all times in a manner that minimizes the risk of unauthorized disclosure while allowing timely access by authorized holders.</P>
              <P>(2) Safeguarding measures that agencies are authorized or accredited to use for classified information and national security systems are also sufficient for safeguarding CUI in accordance with the organization's management and acceptance of risk.</P>

              <P>(3) Agencies may increase CUI Basic's confidentiality impact level above moderate only internally, or by means of agreements with agencies or non-executive branch entities (including agreements for the operation of an information system on behalf of the agencies). Agencies may not otherwise require controls for CUI Basic at a level higher than permitted in the CUI <PRTPAGE P="487"/>Basic requirements when disseminating the CUI Basic outside the agency.</P>
              <P>(4) Authorized holders must comply with policy in the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry, and review any applicable agency CUI policies for additional instructions. For information designated as CUI Specified, authorized holders must also follow the procedures in the underlying laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">CUI safeguarding standards.</E> Authorized holders must safeguard CUI using one of the following types of standards:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">CUI Basic.</E> CUI Basic is the default set of standards authorized holders must apply to all CUI unless the CUI Registry annotates that CUI as CUI Specified.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">CUI Specified.</E> (i) Authorized holders safeguard CUI Specified in accordance with the requirements of the underlying authorities indicated in the CUI Registry.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies governing a specific type of CUI Specified are silent on either a safeguarding or disseminating control, agencies must apply CUI Basic standards to that aspect of the information's controls, unless this results in treatment that does not accord with the CUI Specified authority. In such cases, agencies must apply the CUI Specified standards and may apply limited dissemination controls listed in the CUI Registry to ensure they treat the information in accord with the CUI Specified authority.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Protecting CUI under the control of an authorized holder.</E> Authorized holders must take reasonable precautions to guard against unauthorized disclosure of CUI. They must include the following measures among the reasonable precautions:</P>
              <P>(1) Establish controlled environments in which to protect CUI from unauthorized access or disclosure and make use of those controlled environments;</P>
              <P>(2) Reasonably ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot access or observe CUI, or overhear conversations discussing CUI;</P>
              <P>(3) Keep CUI under the authorized holder's direct control or protect it with at least one physical barrier, and reasonably ensure that the authorized holder or the physical barrier protects the CUI from unauthorized access or observation when outside a controlled environment; and</P>
              <P>(4) Protect the confidentiality of CUI that agencies or authorized holders process, store, or transmit on Federal information systems in accordance with the applicable security requirements and controls established in FIPS PUB 199, FIPS PUB 200, and NIST SP 800-53, (incorporated by reference, see § 2002.2), and paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Protecting CUI when shipping or mailing.</E> When sending CUI, authorized holders:</P>
              <P>(1) May use the United States Postal Service or any commercial delivery service when they need to transport or deliver CUI to another entity;</P>
              <P>(2) Should use in-transit automated tracking and accountability tools when they send CUI;</P>
              <P>(3) May use interoffice or interagency mail systems to transport CUI; and</P>
              <P>(4) Must mark packages that contain CUI according to marking requirements contained in this part and in guidance published by the CUI EA. See § 2002.20 for more guidance on marking requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reproducing CUI.</E> Authorized holders:</P>
              <P>(1) May reproduce (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> copy, scan, print, electronically duplicate) CUI in furtherance of a lawful Government purpose; and</P>
              <P>(2) Must ensure, when reproducing CUI documents on equipment such as printers, copiers, scanners, or fax machines, that the equipment does not retain data or the agency must otherwise sanitize it in accordance with NIST SP 800-53 (incorporated by reference, see § 2002.2).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Destroying CUI.</E> (1) Authorized holders may destroy CUI when:</P>
              <P>(i) The agency no longer needs the information; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Records disposition schedules published or approved by NARA allow.</P>

              <P>(2) When destroying CUI, including in electronic form, agencies must do so in a manner that makes it unreadable, indecipherable, and irrecoverable. Agencies must use any destruction method <PRTPAGE P="488"/>specifically required by law, regulation, or Government-wide policy for that CUI. If the authority does not specify a destruction method, agencies must use one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(i) Guidance for destruction in NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, and NIST SP 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization (incorporated by reference, see § 2002.2); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Any method of destruction approved for Classified National Security Information, as delineated in 32 CFR 2001.47, Destruction, or any implementing or successor guidance.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Information systems that process, store, or transmit CUI.</E> In accordance with FIPS PUB 199 (incorporated by reference, see § 2002.2), CUI Basic is categorized at no less than the moderate confidentiality impact level. FIPS PUB 199 defines the security impact levels for Federal information and Federal information systems. Agencies must also apply the appropriate security requirements and controls from FIPS PUB 200 and NIST SP 800-53 (incorporated by reference, see § 2002.2) to CUI in accordance with any risk-based tailoring decisions they make. Agencies may increase CUI Basic's confidentiality impact level above moderate only internally, or by means of agreements with agencies or non-executive branch entities (including agreements for the operation of an information system on behalf of the agencies). Agencies may not otherwise require controls for CUI Basic at a level higher or different from those permitted in the CUI Basic requirements when disseminating the CUI Basic outside the agency.</P>
              <P>(h) Information systems that process, store, or transmit CUI are of two different types:</P>
              <P>(1) A Federal information system is an information system used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. An information system operated on behalf of an agency provides information processing services to the agency that the Government might otherwise perform itself but has decided to outsource. This includes systems operated exclusively for Government use and systems operated for multiple users (multiple Federal agencies or Government and private sector users). Information systems that a non-executive branch entity operates on behalf of an agency are subject to the requirements of this part as though they are the agency's systems, and agencies may require these systems to meet additional requirements the agency sets for its own internal systems.</P>
              <P>(2) A non-Federal information system is any information system that does not meet the criteria for a Federal information system. Agencies may not treat non-Federal information systems as though they are agency systems, so agencies cannot require that non-executive branch entities protect these systems in the same manner that the agencies might protect their own information systems. When a non-executive branch entity receives Federal information only incidental to providing a service or product to the Government other than processing services, its information systems are not considered Federal information systems. NIST SP 800-171 (incorporated by reference, see § 2002.2) defines the requirements necessary to protect CUI Basic on non-Federal information systems in accordance with the requirements of this part. Agencies must use NIST SP 800-171 when establishing security requirements to protect CUI's confidentiality on non-Federal information systems (unless the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy listed in the CUI Registry for the CUI category or subcategory of the information involved prescribes specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the information's confidentiality, or unless an agreement establishes requirements to protect CUI Basic at higher than moderate confidentiality).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Accessing and disseminating.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General policy</E>—(1) <E T="03">Access.</E> Agencies should disseminate and permit access to CUI, provided such access or dissemination:</P>
              <P>(i) Abides by the laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies that established the CUI category or subcategory;</P>
              <P>(ii) Furthers a lawful Government purpose;<PRTPAGE P="489"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Is not restricted by an authorized limited dissemination control established by the CUI EA; and,</P>
              <P>(iv) Is not otherwise prohibited by law.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Dissemination controls.</E> (i) Agencies must impose dissemination controls judiciously and should do so only to apply necessary restrictions on access to CUI, including those required by law, regulation, or Government-wide policy.</P>
              <P>(ii) Agencies may not impose controls that unlawfully or improperly restrict access to CUI.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Marking.</E> Prior to disseminating CUI, authorized holders must label CUI according to marking guidance issued by the CUI EA, and must include any specific markings required by law, regulation, or Government-wide policy.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Reasonable expectation.</E> To disseminate CUI to a non-executive branch entity, authorized holders must reasonably expect that all intended recipients are authorized to receive the CUI and have a basic understanding of how to handle it.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Agreements.</E> Agencies should enter into agreements with any non-executive branch or foreign entity with which the agency shares or intends to share CUI, as follows (except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section):</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Information-sharing agreements.</E> When agencies intend to share CUI with a non-executive branch entity, they should enter into a formal agreement (see § 2004.4(c) for more information on agreements), whenever feasible. Such an agreement may take any form the agency head approves, but when established, it must include a requirement to comply with Executive Order 13556, Controlled Unclassified Information, November 4, 2010 (3 CFR, 2011 Comp., p. 267) or any successor order (the Order), this part, and the CUI Registry.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sharing CUI without a formal agreement.</E> When an agency cannot enter into agreements under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, but the agency's mission requires it to disseminate CUI to non-executive branch entities, the agency must communicate to the recipient that the Government strongly encourages the non-executive branch entity to protect CUI in accordance with the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry, and that such protections should accompany the CUI if the entity disseminates it further.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Foreign entity sharing.</E> When entering into agreements or arrangements with a foreign entity, agencies should encourage that entity to protect CUI in accordance with the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry to the extent possible, but agencies may use their judgment as to what and how much to communicate, keeping in mind the ultimate goal of safeguarding CUI. If such agreements or arrangements include safeguarding or dissemination controls on unclassified information, the agency must not establish a parallel protection regime to the CUI Program: For example, the agency must use CUI markings rather than alternative ones (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> such as SBU) for safeguarding or dissemination controls on CUI received from or sent to foreign entities, must abide by any requirements set by the CUI category or subcategory's governing laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies, etc.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Pre-existing agreements.</E> When an agency entered into an information-sharing agreement prior to November 14, 2016, the agency should modify any terms in that agreement that conflict with the requirements in the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry, when feasible.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Agreement content.</E> At a minimum, agreements with non-executive branch entities must include provisions that state:</P>
              <P>(i) Non-executive branch entities must handle CUI in accordance with the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry;</P>
              <P>(ii) Misuse of CUI is subject to penalties established in applicable laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies; and</P>

              <P>(iii) The non-executive branch entity must report any non-compliance with handling requirements to the disseminating agency using methods approved by that agency's SAO. When the disseminating agency is not the designating agency, the disseminating agency must notify the designating agency.<PRTPAGE P="490"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Exceptions to agreements.</E> Agencies need not enter a written agreement when they share CUI with the following entities:</P>
              <P>(i) Congress, including any committee, subcommittee, joint committee, joint subcommittee, or office thereof;</P>
              <P>(ii) A court of competent jurisdiction, or any individual or entity when directed by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a Federal administrative law judge (ALJ) appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3501;</P>
              <P>(iii) The Comptroller General, in the course of performing duties of the Government Accountability Office; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Individuals or entities, when the agency releases information to them pursuant to a FOIA or Privacy Act request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Controls on accessing and disseminating CUI</E>—(1) <E T="03">CUI Basic.</E> Authorized holders should disseminate and encourage access to CUI Basic for any recipient when the access meets the requirements set out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">CUI Specified.</E> Authorized holders disseminate and allow access to CUI Specified as required or permitted by the authorizing laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies that established that CUI Specified.</P>
              <P>(i) The CUI Registry annotates CUI that requires or permits Specified controls based on law, regulation, and Government-wide policy.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the absence of specific dissemination restrictions in the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy, agencies may disseminate CUI Specified as they would CUI Basic.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Receipt of CUI.</E> Non-executive branch entities may receive CUI directly from members of the executive branch or as sub-recipients from other non-executive branch entities.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Limited dissemination.</E> (i) Agencies may place additional limits on disseminating CUI only through use of the limited dissemination controls approved by the CUI EA and published in the CUI Registry. These limited dissemination controls are separate from any controls that a CUI Specified authority requires or permits.</P>
              <P>(ii) Using limited dissemination controls to unnecessarily restrict access to CUI is contrary to the goals of the CUI Program. Agencies may therefore use these controls only when it furthers a lawful Government purpose, or laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies require or permit an agency to do so. If an authorized holder has significant doubt about whether it is appropriate to use a limited dissemination control, the authorized holder should consult with and follow the designating agency's policy. If, after consulting the policy, significant doubt still remains, the authorized holder should not apply the limited dissemination control.</P>
              <P>(iii) Only the designating agency may apply limited dissemination controls to CUI. Other entities that receive CUI and seek to apply additional controls must request permission to do so from the designating agency.</P>
              <P>(iv) Authorized holders may apply limited dissemination controls to any CUI for which they are required or permitted to restrict access by or to certain entities.</P>
              <P>(v) Designating entities may combine approved limited dissemination controls listed in the CUI Registry to accommodate necessary practices.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Methods of disseminating CUI.</E> (1) Before disseminating CUI, authorized holders must reasonably expect that all intended recipients have a lawful Government purpose to receive the CUI. Authorized holders may then disseminate the CUI by any method that meets the safeguarding requirements of this part and the CUI Registry and ensures receipt in a timely manner, unless the laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies that govern that CUI require otherwise.</P>

              <P>(2) To disseminate CUI using systems or components that are subject to NIST guidelines and publications (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> email applications, text messaging, facsimile, or voicemail), agencies must do so in accordance with the no-less-than-moderate confidentiality impact value set out in FIPS PUB 199, FIPS PUB 200, NIST SP 800-53 (incorporated by reference, see § 2002.2).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Decontrolling.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Agencies should decontrol as soon as practicable any CUI designated by their agency that no longer requires safeguarding or dissemination controls, <PRTPAGE P="491"/>unless doing so conflicts with the governing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy.</P>
              <P>(b) Agencies may decontrol CUI automatically upon the occurrence of one of the conditions below, or through an affirmative decision by the designating agency:</P>
              <P>(1) When laws, regulations or Government-wide policies no longer require its control as CUI and the authorized holder has the appropriate authority under the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy;</P>
              <P>(2) When the designating agency decides to release it to the public by making an affirmative, proactive disclosure;</P>
              <P>(3) When the agency discloses it in accordance with an applicable information access statute, such as the FOIA, or the Privacy Act (when legally permissible), if the agency incorporates such disclosures into its public release processes; or</P>
              <P>(4) When a pre-determined event or date occurs, as described in § 2002.20(g), unless law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires coordination first.</P>
              <P>(c) The designating agency may also decontrol CUI:</P>
              <P>(1) In response to a request by an authorized holder to decontrol it; or</P>
              <P>(2) Concurrently with any declassification action under Executive Order 13526 or any predecessor or successor order, as long as the information also appropriately qualifies for decontrol as CUI.</P>
              <P>(d) An agency may designate in its CUI policies which agency personnel it authorizes to decontrol CUI, consistent with law, regulation, and Government-wide policy.</P>
              <P>(e) Decontrolling CUI relieves authorized holders from requirements to handle the information under the CUI Program, but does not constitute authorization for public release.</P>
              <P>(f) Authorized holders must clearly indicate that CUI is no longer controlled when restating, paraphrasing, re-using, releasing to the public, or donating it to a private institution. Otherwise, authorized holders do not have to mark, review, or take other actions to indicate the CUI is no longer controlled.</P>
              <P>(1) Agency policy may allow authorized holders to remove or strike through only those CUI markings on the first or cover page of the decontrolled CUI and markings on the first page of any attachments that contain CUI.</P>
              <P>(2) If an authorized holder uses the decontrolled CUI in a newly created document, the authorized holder must remove all CUI markings for the decontrolled information.</P>
              <P>(g) Once decontrolled, any public release of information that was formerly CUI must be in accordance with applicable law and agency policies on the public release of information.</P>
              <P>(h) Authorized holders may request that the designating agency decontrol certain CUI.</P>
              <P>(i) If an authorized holder publicly releases CUI in accordance with the designating agency's authorized procedures, the release constitutes decontrol of the information.</P>
              <P>(j) Unauthorized disclosure of CUI does not constitute decontrol.</P>
              <P>(k) Agencies must not decontrol CUI in an attempt to conceal, or to otherwise circumvent accountability for, an identified unauthorized disclosure.</P>
              <P>(l) When laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies require specific decontrol procedures, authorized holders must follow such requirements.</P>
              <P>(m) The Archivist of the United States may decontrol records transferred to the National Archives in accordance with § 2002.34, absent a specific agreement otherwise with the designating agency. The Archivist decontrols records to facilitate public access pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2108 and NARA's regulations at 36 CFR parts 1235, 1250, and 1256.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Marking.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General marking policy.</E> (1) CUI markings listed in the CUI Registry are the only markings authorized to designate unclassified information requiring safeguarding or dissemination controls. Agencies and authorized holders must, in accordance with the implementation timelines established for the agency by the CUI EA:</P>

              <P>(i) Discontinue all use of legacy or other markings not permitted by this <PRTPAGE P="492"/>part or included in the CUI Registry; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Uniformly and conspicuously apply CUI markings to all CUI exclusively in accordance with the part and the CUI Registry, unless this part or the CUI EA otherwise specifically permits. See paragraph (a)(6) of this section and §§ 2002.38, Waivers of CUI requirements, and 2002.36, Legacy materials, for more information.</P>
              <P>(2) Agencies may not modify CUI Program markings or deviate from the method of use prescribed by the CUI EA (in this part and the CUI Registry) in an effort to accommodate existing agency marking practices, except in circumstances approved by the CUI EA. The CUI Program prohibits using markings or practices not included in this part or the CUI Registry. If legacy markings remain on information, the legacy markings are void and no longer indicate that the information is protected or that it is or qualifies as CUI.</P>
              <P>(3) An agency receiving an incorrectly marked document should notify either the disseminating entity or the designating agency, and request a properly marked document.</P>
              <P>(4) The designating agency determines that the information qualifies for CUI status and applies the appropriate CUI marking when it designates that information as CUI.</P>
              <P>(5) If an agency has information within its control that qualifies as CUI but has not been previously marked as CUI for any reason (for example, pursuant to an agency internal marking waiver as referenced in § 2002.38 (a)), the agency must mark it as CUI prior to disseminating it.</P>
              <P>(6) Agencies must not mark information as CUI to conceal illegality, negligence, ineptitude, or other disreputable circumstances embarrassing to any person, any agency, the Federal Government, or any of their partners, or for any purpose other than to adhere to the law, regulation, or Government-wide policy authorizing the control.</P>
              <P>(7) The lack of a CUI marking on information that qualifies as CUI does not exempt the authorized holder from abiding by applicable handling requirements as described in the Order, this part, and the CUI Registry.</P>

              <P>(8) When it is impractical for an agency to individually mark CUI due to quantity or nature of the information, or when an agency has issued a limited CUI marking waiver, authorized holders must make recipients aware of the information's CUI status using an alternate marking method that is readily apparent (for example, through user access agreements, a computer system digital splash screen (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> alerts that flash up when accessing the system), or signs in storage areas or on containers).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The CUI banner marking.</E> Designators of CUI must mark all CUI with a CUI banner marking, which may include up to three elements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">The CUI control marking (mandatory).</E> (i) The CUI control marking may consist of either the word “CONTROLLED” or the acronym “CUI,” at the designator's discretion. Agencies may specify in their CUI policy that employees must use one or the other.</P>
              <P>(ii) The CUI Registry contains additional, specific guidance and instructions for using the CUI control marking.</P>
              <P>(iii) Authorized holders who designate CUI may not use alternative markings to identify or mark items as CUI.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">CUI category or subcategory markings (mandatory for CUI Specified).</E> (i) The CUI Registry lists the category and subcategory markings, which align with the CUI's governing category or subcategory.</P>
              <P>(ii) Although the CUI Program does not require agencies to use category or subcategory markings on CUI Basic, an agency's CUI SAO may establish agency policy that mandates use of CUI category or subcategory markings on CUI Basic.</P>

              <P>(iii) However, authorized holders must include in the CUI banner marking all CUI Specified category or subcategory markings that pertain to the information in the document. If law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires specific marking, disseminating, informing, distribution limitation, or warning statements, agencies must use those indicators as those authorities require or permit. However, <PRTPAGE P="493"/>agencies must not include these additional indicators in the CUI banner marking or CUI portion markings.</P>
              <P>(iv) The CUI Registry contains additional, specific guidance and instructions for using CUI category and subcategory markings.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited dissemination control markings.</E> (i) CUI limited dissemination control markings align with limited dissemination controls established by the CUI EA under § 2002.16(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(ii) Agency policy should include specific criteria establishing which authorized holders may apply limited dissemination controls and their corresponding markings, and when. Such agency policy must align with the requirements in § 2002.16(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(iii) The CUI Registry contains additional, specific guidance and instructions for using limited dissemination control markings.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Using the CUI banner marking.</E> (1) The content of the CUI banner marking must apply to the whole document (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> inclusive of all CUI within the document) and must be the same on each page of the document that includes CUI.</P>
              <P>(2) The CUI Registry contains additional, specific guidelines and instructions for using the CUI banner marking.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">CUI designation indicator (mandatory).</E> (1) All documents containing CUI must carry an indicator of who designated the CUI within it. This must include the designator's agency (at a minimum) and may take any form that identifies the designating agency, including letterhead or other standard agency indicators, or adding a “Controlled by” line (for example, “Controlled by: Division 5, Department of Good Works.”).</P>
              <P>(2) The designation indicator must be readily apparent to authorized holders and may appear only on the first page or cover. The CUI Registry contains additional, specific guidance and requirements for using CUI designation indicators.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">CUI decontrolling indicators.</E> (1) Where feasible, designating agencies must include a specific decontrolling date or event with all CUI. Agencies may do so in any manner that makes the decontrolling schedule readily apparent to an authorized holder.</P>
              <P>(2) Authorized holders may consider specific items of CUI as decontrolled as of the date indicated, requiring no further review by, or communication with, the designator.</P>
              <P>(3) If using a specific event after which the CUI is considered decontrolled:</P>

              <P>(i) The event must be foreseeable and verifiable by any authorized holder (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> not based on or requiring special access or knowledge); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The designator should include point of contact and preferred method of contact information in the decontrol indicator when using this method, to allow authorized holders to verify that a specified event has occurred.</P>
              <P>(4) The CUI Registry contains additional, specific guidance and instructions for using limited dissemination control markings.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Portion marking CUI.</E> (1) Agencies are permitted and encouraged to portion mark all CUI, to facilitate information sharing and proper handling.</P>
              <P>(2) Authorized holders who designate CUI may mark CUI only with portion markings approved by the CUI EA and listed in the CUI Registry.</P>
              <P>(3) CUI portion markings consist of the following elements:</P>
              <P>(i) The CUI control marking, which must be the acronym “CUI”;</P>
              <P>(ii) CUI category/subcategory portion markings (if required or permitted); and</P>
              <P>(iii) CUI limited dissemination control portion markings (if required).</P>
              <P>(4) When using portion markings:</P>
              <P>(i) CUI category and subcategory portion markings are optional for CUI Basic. Agencies may manage their use by means of agency policy.</P>
              <P>(ii) Authorized holders permitted to designate CUI must portion mark both CUI and uncontrolled unclassified portions.</P>

              <P>(5) In cases where portions consist of several segments, such as paragraphs, sub-paragraphs, bullets, and sub-bullets, and the control level is the same throughout, designators of CUI may place a single portion marking at the beginning of the primary paragraph or bullet. However, if the portion includes <PRTPAGE P="494"/>different CUI categories or subcategories, or if the portion includes some CUI and some uncontrolled unclassified information, authorized holders should portion mark all segments separately to avoid improper control of any one segment.</P>
              <P>(6) Each portion must reflect the control level of only that individual portion. If the information contained in a sub-paragraph or sub-bullet is a different CUI category or subcategory from its parent paragraph or parent bullet, this does not make the parent paragraph or parent bullet controlled at that same level.</P>
              <P>(7) The CUI Registry contains additional, specific guidance and instructions for using CUI portion markings and uncontrolled unclassified portion markings.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Commingling CUI markings with Classified National Security Information (CNSI).</E> When authorized holders include CUI in documents that also contain CNSI, the decontrolling provisions of the Order and this part apply only to portions marked as CUI. In addition, authorized holders must:</P>
              <P>(1) Portion mark all CUI to ensure that authorized holders can distinguish CUI portions from portions containing classified and uncontrolled unclassified information;</P>
              <P>(2) Include the CUI control marking, CUI Specified category and subcategory markings, and limited dissemination control markings in an overall banner marking; and</P>
              <P>(3) Follow the requirements of the Order and this part, and instructions in the CUI Registry on marking CUI when commingled with CNSI.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Commingling restricted data (RD) and formerly restricted data (FRD) with CUI.</E> (1) To the extent possible, avoid commingling RD or FRD with CUI in the same document. When it is not practicable to avoid such commingling, follow the marking requirements in the Order and this part, and instructions in the CUI Registry, as well as the marking requirements in 10 CFR part 1045, Nuclear Classification and Declassification.</P>
              <P>(2) Follow the requirements of 10 CFR part 1045 when extracting an RD or FRD portion for use in a new document.</P>
              <P>(3) Follow the requirements of the Order and this part, and instructions in the CUI Registry if extracting a CUI portion for use in a new document.</P>
              <P>(4) The lack of declassification instructions for RD or FRD portions does not eliminate the requirement to process commingled documents for declassification in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act, or 10 CFR part 1045.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Packages and parcels containing CUI.</E> (1) Address packages that contain CUI for delivery only to a specific recipient.</P>
              <P>(2) Do not put CUI markings on the outside of an envelope or package, or otherwise indicate on the outside that the item contains CUI.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Transmittal document marking requirements.</E> (1) When a transmittal document accompanies CUI, the transmittal document must include a CUI marking on its face (“CONTROLLED” or “CUI”), indicating that CUI is attached or enclosed.</P>
              <P>(2) The transmittal document must also include conspicuously on its face the following or similar instructions, as appropriate:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Limited CUI marking waivers within the agency.</E> When an agency designates information as CUI but determines that marking it as CUI is excessively burdensome, an agency's CUI SAO may approve waivers of all or some of the CUI marking requirements while that CUI remains within agency control.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limited legacy material marking waivers within the agency.</E> (1) In situations in which the agency has a substantial amount of stored information with legacy markings, and removing legacy markings and designating or re-marking it as CUI would be excessively burdensome, the agency's CUI SAO may approve a waiver of these requirements for some or all of that information while it remains under agency control.</P>
              <P>(2) When an authorized holder re-uses any legacy information or information derived from legacy documents that qualifies as CUI, they must remove or redact legacy markings and designate or re-mark the information as CUI, even if the information is under a legacy material marking waiver prior to re-use.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exigent circumstances waivers.</E> (1) In exigent circumstances, the agency head or the CUI SAO may waive the provisions and requirements established in this part or the CUI Registry for any CUI while it is within the agency's possession or control, unless specifically prohibited by applicable laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies.</P>
              <P>(2) Exigent circumstances waivers may apply when an agency shares the information with other agencies or non-Federal entities. In such cases, the authorized holders must make recipients aware of the CUI status of any disseminated information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">For all waivers.</E> (1) The CUI SAO must still ensure that the agency appropriately safeguards and disseminates the CUI. See § 2002.20(a)(7);</P>
              <P>(2) The CUI SAO must detail in each waiver the alternate protection methods the agency will employ to ensure protection of CUI subject to the waiver;</P>
              <P>(3) All marking waivers apply to CUI subject to the waiver only while that agency continues to possess that CUI. No marking waiver may accompany CUI when an authorized holder disseminates it outside that agency;</P>
              <P>(4) Authorized holders must uniformly and conspicuously apply CUI markings to all CUI prior to disseminating it outside the agency unless otherwise specifically permitted by the CUI EA; and</P>
              <P>(5) When the circumstances requiring the waiver end, the CUI SAO must reinstitute the requirements for all CUI subject to the waiver without delay.</P>

              <SUBJECT>CUI and disclosure statutes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General policy.</E> The fact that an agency designates certain information as CUI does not affect an agency's or employee's determinations pursuant to any law that requires the agency or the employee to disclose that information or permits them to do so as a matter of discretion. The agency or employee must make such determinations according to the criteria set out in the governing law, not on the basis of the information's status as CUI.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">CUI and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</E> Agencies must not cite the FOIA as a CUI safeguarding or disseminating control authority for CUI. When an agency is determining whether to disclose information in response to a FOIA request, the agency must base its decision on the content of the information and applicability of any FOIA statutory exemptions, regardless of whether an agency designates or marks the information as CUI. There may be circumstances in which an agency may disclose CUI to an individual or entity, including through a FOIA response, but such disclosure does not always constitute public release as defined in this part. Although disclosed via a FOIA response, the agency may still need to control the CUI while the agency continues to hold the information, despite the disclosure, unless the agency otherwise decontrols it (or the agency includes in its policies that FOIA disclosure always results in public release and the CUI does not otherwise have another legal requirement for its continued control).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">CUI and the Whistleblower Protection Act.</E> This part does not change or affect existing legal protections for whistleblowers. The fact that an agency designates or marks certain information as CUI does not determine whether an individual may lawfully disclose that information under a law or other authority, and does not preempt or otherwise affect whistleblower legal protections provided by law, regulation, or executive order or directive.</P>

              <SUBJECT>CUI and the Privacy Act.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The fact that records are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 does not mean that agencies must mark them as CUI. Consult agency policies or guidance to determine which records may be subject to the Privacy Act; consult the CUI Registry to determine which privacy information must be marked as CUI. Information contained in Privacy Act systems of records may also be subject to controls under other CUI categories or subcategories and the agency may need to mark that information as CUI for that reason. In addition, when determining whether the agency must protect certain information under the Privacy Act, or whether the Privacy Act allows the agency to release the information to an individual, the agency must base its decision on the content of the information and the Privacy Act's criteria, regardless of whether an agency designates or marks the information as CUI.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Challenges to designation of information as CUI.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Authorized holders of CUI who, in good faith, believe that its designation as CUI is improper or incorrect, or who believe they have received unmarked CUI, should notify the disseminating agency of this belief. When the disseminating agency is not the designating agency, the disseminating agency must notify the designating agency.<PRTPAGE P="498"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) If the information at issue is involved in Government litigation, or the challenge to its designation or marking as CUI arises as part of the litigation, the issue of whether the challenger may access the information will be addressed via the litigation process instead of by the agency CUI program. Challengers should nonetheless notify the agency of the issue through the agency process described below, and include its litigation connection.</P>
              <P>(c) CUI SAOs must create a process within their agency to accept and manage challenges to CUI status. At a minimum, this process must include a timely response to the challenger that:</P>
              <P>(1) Acknowledges receipt of the challenge;</P>
              <P>(2) States an expected timetable for response to the challenger;</P>
              <P>(3) Provides an opportunity for the challenger to define a rationale for belief that the CUI in question is inappropriately designated;</P>
              <P>(4) Gives contact information for the official making the agency's decision in this matter; and</P>
              <P>(5) Ensures that challengers who are authorized holders have the option of bringing such challenges anonymously, and that challengers are not subject to retribution for bringing such challenges.</P>
              <P>(d) Until the challenge is resolved, authorized holders should continue to safeguard and disseminate the challenged CUI at the control level indicated in the markings.</P>
              <P>(e) If a challenging party disagrees with the response to a challenge, that party may use the Dispute Resolution procedures described in § 2002.52.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Dispute resolution for agencies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies governing the CUI involved in a dispute set out specific procedures, processes, and requirements for resolving disputes, agencies must follow those processes for that CUI. This includes submitting the dispute to someone other than the CUI EA for resolution if the authority so requires. If the CUI at issue is involved in litigation, the agency should refer the issue to the appropriate attorneys for resolution through the litigation process.</P>
              <P>(b) When laws, regulations, and Government-wide policies governing the CUI do not set out specific procedures, processes, or requirements for CUI dispute resolution (or the information is not involved in litigation), this part governs.</P>
              <P>(c) All parties to a dispute arising from implementing or interpreting the Order, this part, or the CUI Registry should make every effort to resolve the dispute expeditiously. Parties should address disputes within a reasonable, mutually acceptable time period, taking into consideration the parties' mission, sharing, and protection requirements.</P>
              <P>(d) If parties to a dispute cannot reach a mutually acceptable resolution, either party may refer the matter to the CUI EA.</P>
              <P>(e) The CUI EA acts as the impartial arbiter of the dispute and has the authority to render a decision on the dispute after consulting with all affected parties. If a party to the dispute is also a member of the Intelligence Community, the CUI EA must consult with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence when the CUI EA receives the dispute for resolution.</P>
              <P>(f) Until the dispute is resolved, authorized holders should continue to safeguard and disseminate any disputed CUI at the control level indicated in the markings, or as directed by the CUI EA if the information is unmarked.</P>
              <P>(g) Parties may appeal the CUI EA's decision through the Director of OMB to the President for resolution, pursuant to section 4(e) of the Order. If one of the parties to the dispute is the CUI EA and the parties cannot resolve the dispute under paragraph (c) of this section, the parties may likewise refer the matter to OMB for resolution.</P>

A motion passes when it receives a majority of affirmative votes of the members voting. In circumstances in which members abstain from voting, a Panel decision to reverse an agency's classification decision requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members present.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Votes in a non-meeting context.</E> The Chair may call for a vote of the membership outside the context of a formal ISCAP meeting. An alternate member may also participate in such a vote if the primary member cannot be present. The Executive Secretary records and retains such votes in a documentary form and immediately reports the results to the Chair and other primary or alternate members, including all notes of concurrence or dissent. If a member expresses dissent to taking a non-meeting vote, any member may request the Chair call a meeting of the members to discuss the issue under consideration and to hold an in-person vote.</P>

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Resolution of appeals.</E> The Panel may vote to affirm the agency's decision, to reverse the agency's decision in whole or in part, or to remand the matter to the agency for further consideration. A decision to reverse an agency's decision requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members present. In circumstances in which members abstain from voting, a Panel decision to reverse an agency's classification decision requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members present.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The Executive Secretary promptly notifies the appellant and designated senior agency official in writing of the Panel's decision.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Agency appeals.</E> Within 60 days of receipt of an ISCAP decision that reverses a final agency decision, the agency head may petition the President through the National Security Advisor to overrule the Panel's decision.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Protection of classified information.</E> All persons involved in the appeal will make every effort to minimize the inclusion of classified information in the appeal file. Any classified information contained in the appeal file is handled and protected in accordance with the Order and its implementing directives. Information that is subject to an appeal from an agency decision denying declassification under the mandatory review provisions of the Order remains classified unless and until a final decision is made to declassify it.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Maintenance and disposition of file.</E> The Executive Secretary shall maintain the appeal file among the ISCAP's records in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207 (Presidential Records Act).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part sets out the National Industrial Security Program (“NISP” or “the Program”) governing the protection of agency classified information released to Federal contractors, licensees, grantees, and certificate holders. It establishes uniform standards throughout the Program, and helps agencies implement requirements in E.O. 12829, National Industrial Security Program, as amended by E.O. 12558 and E.O.13691 (collectively referred to as “E.O. 12829”), E.O. 13691, Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing, and E.O. 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information. It applies to any executive branch agency that releases classified information to current, prospective, or former Federal contractors, licensees, grantees, or certificate holders. However, this part does not stand alone; users should refer concurrently to the underlying executive orders for guidance. ISOO maintains policy oversight over the NISP as established by E.O.12829.</P>
              <P>(b) This part also does not apply to release of classified information pursuant to criminal proceedings. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) (18 U.S.C. Appendix 3) governs release of classified information in criminal proceedings.</P>

              <P>(c) Nothing in this part supersedes the authority of the Secretary of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011, <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (collectively referred to as “the Atomic Energy Act”); the authority of the Director of National Intelligence (or any intelligence community element) under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-458), the National Security Act of 1947 as amended (50 U.S.C. 401, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and E.O. 12333 (December 4, 1981), as amended by E.O. 13355, Strengthened Management of the Intelligence Community (August 27, 2004) and E.O. 13470, Further Amendments to Executive Order 12333 (July 30, 2008) (collectively referred to as “E.O. 12333”); or the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security, as the Executive Agent for the Classified National Security Information Program established under E.O. 13549, Classified National Security Information Program for State, Local, Tribal, and Private Sector Entities (August 18, 2010), or as established by E.O. 13284, Amendment of Executive Orders, and Other Actions, in Connection with the Establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (January 23, 2003). In exercising these authorities, CSAs make every effort to facilitate reciprocity, avoid duplication of regulatory requirements, and facilitate uniform standards.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions that apply to this part.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Access</E> is the ability or opportunity to gain knowledge of classified information.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency(ies)</E> are any “Executive agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105; any “Military department” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102; and any other entity within the executive branch that releases classified information to private sector entities. This includes component agencies under another agency or under a cross-agency oversight office (such as ODNI with CIA), which are also agencies for purposes of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Classified Critical Infrastructure Protection Program (CCIPP)</E> is the DHS program that executes the classified infrastructure protection program designated by E.O. 13691, “Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing.” The Government uses this program to share classified cybersecurity-related information with employees of private sector entities that own or operate critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure refers to systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that incapacitating or destroying such systems <PRTPAGE P="507"/>and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof. These entities include banks and power plants, among others. The sectors of critical infrastructure are listed in Presidential Policy Directive 21, <E T="03">Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience</E> (February 12, 2013).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Classified Critical Infrastructure Protection Program (CCIPP) security point of contact (security POC)</E> is an official whom a CCIPP entity designates to maintain eligibility information about the entity and its cleared employees, and to report that information to DHS. The CCIPP security POC must be eligible for access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Classified information</E> is information the Government designates as requiring protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security, pursuant to E.O. 13526, Classified National Security Information, or any predecessor order, and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Classified information includes national security information (NSI), restricted data (RD), and formerly restricted data (FRD), regardless of its physical form or characteristics (including tangible items other than documents).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Cognizance</E> is the area over which a CSA has operational oversight. Normally, a statute or executive order establishes a CSA's cognizance over certain types of information, programs, or non-CSA agencies, although CSAs may also have cognizance through an agreement with another CSA or non-CSA agency or an entity. A CSA may have cognizance over a particular type(s) of classified information based on specific authorities (such as those listed in § 2004.1(c)), and a CSA may have cognizance over certain agencies or cross-agency programs (such as DoD's cognizance over non-CSA agencies as the EA for NISP, or ODNI's oversight (if applicable) of all intelligence community elements within the executive branch). Entities fall under a CSA's cognizance when they enter or compete to enter contracts or agreements to access classified information under the CSA's cognizance, including when they enter or compete to enter such contracts or agreements with a non-CSA agency or another entity under the CSA's cognizance.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Cognizant security agencies (CSAs)</E> are the agencies E.O. 12829, sec. 202, designates as having NISP implementation and security responsibilities for their own agencies (including component agencies) and any entities and non-CSA agencies under their cognizance. The CSAs are: Department of Defense (DoD); Department of Energy (DOE); Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI); and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Cognizant security office (CSO)</E> is an organizational unit to which the head of a CSA delegates authority to administer industrial security services on behalf of the CSA.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Contracts or agreements</E> are any type of arrangement between an agency and an entity or an agency and another agency. They include, but are not limited to, contracts, sub-contracts, licenses, certificates, memoranda of understanding, inter-agency service agreements, other types of documents or arrangements setting out responsibilities, requirements, or terms agreed upon by the parties, programs, projects, and other legitimate U.S. or foreign government requirements. FOCI mitigation or negation measures, such as Voting Trust Agreements, that have the word “agreement” in their title are not included in the term “agreements” within this part.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Controlling agency</E> is an agency that owns or controls the following categories of proscribed information and thus has authority over access to or release of the information: NSA for communications security information (COMSEC); DOE for restricted data (RD); and ODNI for sensitive compartmented information (SCI).</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Entity</E> is a generic and comprehensive term which may include sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies, societies, associations, institutions, contractors, licensees, grantees, certificate holders, and other organizations usually established and operating to carry out a commercial, industrial, <PRTPAGE P="508"/>educational, or other legitimate business, enterprise, or undertaking, or parts of these organizations. It may reference an entire organization, a prime contractor, parent organization, a branch or division, another type of sub-element, a sub-contractor, subsidiary, or other subordinate or connected entity (referred to as “sub-entities” when necessary to distinguish such entities from prime or parent entities), a specific location or facility, or the headquarters/official business location of the organization, depending upon the organization's business structure, the access needs involved, and the responsible CSA's procedures. The term “entity” as used in this part refers to the particular entity to which an agency might release, or is releasing, classified information, whether that entity is a parent or subordinate organization.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Entity eligibility determination</E> is an assessment by the CSA as to whether an entity is eligible for access to classified information of a certain level (and all lower levels). Eligibility determinations may be broad or limited to specific contracts, sponsoring agencies, or circumstances. A favorable determination results in eligibility to access classified information under the cognizance of the responsible CSA to the level approved. When the entity would be accessing categories of information such as RD or SCI for which the CSA for that information has set additional requirements, CSAs must also assess whether the entity is eligible for access to that category. Some CSAs refer to their favorable determinations as facility security clearances (FCL). A favorable entity eligibility determination does not convey authority to store classified information.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Foreign interest</E> is any foreign government, element of a foreign government, or representative of a foreign government; any form of business enterprise or legal entity organized, chartered, or incorporated under the laws of any country other than the United States or its territories; and any person who is not a United States citizen or national.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Government contracting activity (GCA)</E> is an agency component or subcomponent to which the agency head delegates broad authority regarding acquisition functions. A foreign government may also be a GCA.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Industrial security services</E> are those activities performed by a CSA to verify that an entity is protecting classified information. They include, but are not limited to, conducting oversight reviews, making eligibility determinations, and providing agency and entity guidance and training.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Insider(s)</E> are entity employees who are eligible to access classified information and may be authorized access to any U.S. Government or entity resource (such as personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, or systems).</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Insider threat</E> is the likelihood, risk, or potential that an insider will use his or her authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the national security of the United States. Insider threats may include harm to entity or program information to the extent that the information impacts the entity's or agency's obligations to protect classified information.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Insider threat response action(s)</E> are actions (such as investigations) an agency takes to ascertain whether an insider threat exists, and actions the agency takes to mitigate the threat. Agencies may conduct insider threat response actions through their counterintelligence (CI), security, law enforcement, or inspector general organizations, depending on the statutory authority and internal policies that govern the agency.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Insider threat program senior official (SO)</E> is the official an agency head or entity designates with responsibility to manage, account for, and oversee the agency's or entity's insider threat program, pursuant to the National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards. An agency may have more than one insider threat program SO.</P>
              <P>(t) <E T="03">Key managers and officials (KMO)</E> are the senior management official (or authorized executive official under CCIPP), the entity's security officer (or security POC under CCIPP), the insider threat program senior official, and other entity employees whom the responsible CSA identifies as having authority, direct or indirect, to influence or decide matters affecting the entity's <PRTPAGE P="509"/>management or operations, its contracts requiring access to classified information, or national security interests. They may include individuals who hold majority ownership interest in the entity (in the form of stock or other ownership interests).</P>
              <P>(u) <E T="03">Proscribed information</E> is information that is classified as top secret (TS) information; communications security (COMSEC) information (excluding controlled cryptographic items when un-keyed or utilized with unclassified keys); restricted data (RD); special access program information (SAP); or sensitive compartmented information (SCI).</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Security officer</E> is a U.S. citizen employee the entity designates to supervise and direct security measures implementing NISPOM (or equivalent; such as DOE Orders) requirements. Some CSAs refer to this position as a facility security officer (FSO). The security officer must complete security training specified by the responsible CSA, and must have and maintain an employee eligibility determination level that is at least the same level as the entity's eligibility determination level.</P>
              <P>(w) <E T="03">Senior agency official for NISP (SAO for NISP)</E> is the official an agency head designates to direct and administer the agency's National Industrial Security Program.</P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Senior management official (SMO)</E> is the person in charge of an entity. Under the CCIPP, this is the authorized executive official with authority to sign the security agreement with DHS.</P>
              <P>(y) <E T="03">Sub-entity</E> is an entity's branch or division, another type of sub-element, a sub-contractor, subsidiary, or other subordinate or connected entity. Sub-entities fall under the definition of “entity,” but this part refers to them as sub-entities when necessary to distinguish such entities from prime contractor or parent entities. See definition of “entity” in paragraph (k) of this section for more context.</P>

              <P>(c) The EA, in consultation with all affected agencies and with the concurrence of the other CSAs, develops the requirements, restrictions, and safeguards contained in the NISPOM. The EA uses security standards applicable to agencies as the basis for developing NISPOM entity standards to the extent practicable and reasonable.</P>
              <P>(d) The EA also facilitates the NISPOM coordination process, which addresses issues raised by entities, agencies, ISOO, or the NISPPAC, including requests to create or change NISPOM security standards.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Agency responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency categories and general areas of responsibility.</E> Federal agencies fall into three categories for the purpose of NISP responsibilities:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">CSAs.</E> CSAs are responsible for carrying out NISP implementation within their agency, for providing NISP industrial security services on behalf of non-CSA agencies by agreement when authorized, and for overseeing NISP compliance by entities that access classified information under the CSA's cognizance. When the CSA has oversight responsibilities for a particular non-CSA agency or for an entity, the CSA also functions as the responsible CSA;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-CSA agencies.</E> Non-CSA agencies are responsible for entering agreements with a designated CSA for industrial security services, and are responsible for carrying out NISP implementation within their agency consistently with the agreement, the CSA's guidelines and procedures, and this regulation; or<PRTPAGE P="511"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Agencies that are components of another agency.</E> Component agencies do not have itemized responsibilities under this regulation and do not independently need to enter agreements with a CSA, but they follow, and may have responsibilities under, implementing guidelines and procedures established by their CSA or non-CSA agency, or both.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsible CSA role.</E> (1) The responsible CSA is the CSA (or its delegated CSO) that provides NISP industrial security services on behalf of an agency, determines an entity's eligibility for access, and monitors and inspects an entity's NISP implementation.</P>
              <P>(2) In general, the goal is to have one responsible CSA for each agency and for each entity, to minimize the burdens that can result from complying with differing CSA procedures and requirements.</P>
              <P>(i) With regard to agencies, NISP accomplishes this goal by a combination of designated CSAs and agreements between agencies and CSAs.</P>
              <P>(ii) With regard to entities, CSAs strive to reduce the number of responsible CSAs for a given entity as much as possible. To this end, when more than one CSA releases classified information to a given entity, those CSAs agree on which is the responsible CSA. However, due to certain unique agency authorities, there may be circumstances in which a given entity is under the oversight of more than one responsible CSA.</P>
              <P>(3) Responsible CSA for agencies:</P>
              <P>(i) In general, each CSA serves as the responsible CSA for classified information that it (or any of its component agencies) releases to entities, unless it enters an agreement otherwise with another CSA.</P>
              <P>(ii) DoD serves as the responsible CSA for DHS with the exception of the CCIPP, based on an agreement between the two CSAs.</P>
              <P>(iii) DoD serves as the responsible CSA on behalf of all non-CSA agencies, except CSA components, based on E.O. 12829 and its role as NISP EA.</P>
              <P>(iv) ODNI serves as the responsible CSA for CIA.</P>
              <P>(4) Responsible CSA for entities: When determining the responsible CSA for a given entity, the involved CSAs consider, at a minimum: retained authorities, the information's classification level, number of contracts requiring access to classified information, location, number of Government customers, volume of classified activity, safeguarding requirements, responsibility for entity employee eligibility determinations, and any special requirements.</P>
              <P>(5) Responsible CSAs may delegate oversight responsibility to a cognizant security office (CSO) through CSA policy or by written delegation. The CSA must inform entities under its cognizance if it delegates responsibilities. For purposes of this rule, the term CSA also refers to the CSO.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">CSA responsibilities.</E> (1) The CSA may perform GCA responsibilities as its own GCA.</P>
              <P>(2) As CSA, the CSA performs or delegates the following responsibilities:</P>
              <P>(i) Designates a CSA senior agency official (SAO) for NISP;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identifies the insider threat program senior official (SO) to the Director, ISOO;</P>
              <P>(iii) Shares insider threat information with other CSAs, as lawful and appropriate, including information that indicates an insider threat about entity employees eligible to access classified information;</P>
              <P>(iv) Acts upon and shares—with security management, GCAs, insider threat program employees, and Government program and CI officials—any relevant entity-reported information about security or CI concerns, as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(v) Submits reports to ISOO as required by this part; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Develops, coordinates, and provides concurrence on changes to the NISPOM when requested by the EA.</P>
              <P>(3) As a responsible CSA, the CSA also performs or delegates the following responsibilities:</P>
              <P>(i) Determines whether an entity is eligible for access to classified information (see § 2004.32);</P>

              <P>(ii) Allocates funds, ensures appropriate investigations are conducted, and determines entity employee eligibility for access to classified information (see § 2004.36);<PRTPAGE P="512"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Reviews and approves entity safeguarding measures, including making safeguarding capability determinations (see § 2004.38);</P>
              <P>(iv) Conducts periodic security reviews of entity operations (see § 2004.26) to determine that entities: effectively protect classified information provided to them; and follow NISPOM (or equivalent) requirements;</P>
              <P>(v) Provides and regularly updates guidance, training, training materials, and briefings to entities on:</P>
              <P>(A) Entity implementation of NISPOM (or equivalent) requirements, including: responsibility for protecting classified information, requesting NISPOM interpretations, establishing training programs, and submitting required reports;</P>
              <P>(B) Initial security briefings and other briefings required for special categories of information;</P>
              <P>(C) Authorization measures for information systems processing classified information (except DHS) (see § 2004.40);</P>
              <P>(D) Security training for security officers (or CCIPP POCs) and other employees whose official duties include performing NISP-related functions;</P>
              <P>(E) Insider threat programs in accordance with the National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs; and</P>
              <P>(F) Other guidance and training as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(vi) Establishes a mechanism for entities to submit requests for waivers to NISPOM (or equivalent) provisions;</P>
              <P>(vii) Reviews, continuously analyzes, and adjudicates, as appropriate, reports from entities regarding events that:</P>
              <P>(A) Impact the status of the entity's eligibility for access to classisfied information;</P>
              <P>(B) Impact an employee's eligibility for access;</P>
              <P>(C) May indicate an employee poses an insider threat;</P>
              <P>(D) Affect proper safeguarding of classified information; or</P>
              <P>(E) Indicate that classified information has been lost or compromised;</P>
              <P>(viii) Verifies that reports offered in confidence and so marked by an entity may be withheld from public disclosure under applicable exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);</P>
              <P>(ix) Requests any additional information needed from an entity about involved employees to determine continued eligibility for access to classified information when the entity reports loss, possible compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of classified information; and</P>
              <P>(x) Posts hotline information on its website for entity access, or otherwise disseminates contact numbers to the entities for which the CSA is responsible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Non-CSA agency head responsibilities.</E> The head of a non-CSA agency that is not a CSA component and that releases classified information to entities, performs the following responsibilities:</P>
              <P>(1) Designates an SAO for the NISP;</P>
              <P>(2) Identifies the insider threat program SO to ISOO to facilitate information sharing;</P>
              <P>(3) Enters into an agreement with the EA (except agencies that are components of another agency or a cross-agency oversight office) to act as the responsible CSA on the agency's behalf (see paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section);</P>
              <P>(4) Performs, or delegates in writing to a GCA, the following responsibilities:</P>
              <P>(i) Provides appropriate education and training to agency personnel who implement the NISP;</P>
              <P>(ii) Includes FAR security requirements clause 52.204-2, or equivalent (such as the DEAR clause 952.204-2), and a contract security classification specification (or equivalent guidance) into contracts and solicitations that require access to classified information (see § 2004.30); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Reports to the appropriate CSA adverse information and insider threat activity pertaining to entity employees having access to classified information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reviews of entity NISP implementation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The responsible CSA conducts recurring oversight reviews of entities' NISP security programs to verify that the entity is protecting classified information and is implementing the provisions of the NISPOM (or equivalent). The CSA determines the scope and frequency of reviews. The CSA generally notifies entities when a review will take place, but may also conduct unannounced reviews at its discretion.</P>
              <P>(b) CSAs make every effort to avoid unnecessarily intruding into entity employee personal effects during the reviews.</P>
              <P>(c) A CSA may, on entity premises, physically examine the interior spaces of containers not authorized to store classified information in the presence of the entity's representative.</P>
              <P>(d) As part of a security review, the CSA:</P>
              <P>(1) Verifies that the entity limits entity employees with access to classified information to the minimum number necessary to perform on contracts requiring access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(2) Validates that the entity has not provided its employees unauthorized access to classified information;</P>
              <P>(3) Reviews the entity's self-inspection program and evaluates and records the entity's remedial actions; and</P>
              <P>(4) Verifies that the GCA approved any public release of information pertaining to a contract requiring access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(e) As a result of findings during the security review, the CSA may, as appropriate, notify:</P>
              <P>(1) GCAs if there are unfavorable results from the review; and</P>
              <P>(2) A prime entity if the CSA discovers unsatisfactory security conditions pertaining to a sub-entity.</P>
              <P>(f) The CSA maintains a record of reviews it conducts and the results. Based on review results, the responsible CSA determines whether an entity's eligibility for access to classified information may continue. See § 2004.32(g).</P>

              <P>(2) The GCA must also include a contract security classification specification (or equivalent guidance) with each contract or agreement and solicitation that requires access to classified information. The contract security classification specification (or equivalent guidance) must identify the specific elements of classified information involved in each phase of the contract or agreement life-cycle, such as:</P>
              <P>(i) Level of classification;</P>

              <P>(ii) Where the entity will access or store the classified information, and <PRTPAGE P="514"/>any requirements or limitations on transmitting classified information outside the entity;</P>
              <P>(iii) Any special accesses;</P>
              <P>(iv) Any classification guides or other guidance the entity needs to perform during that phase of the contract or agreement;</P>

              <P>(3) The GCA revises the contract security classification specification (or equivalent guidance) throughout the contract or agreement life-cycle as security requirements change.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> Classification guidance is the exclusive responsibility of the GCA. The GCA prepares classification guidance in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.15, and provides appropriate security classification and declassification guidance to entities.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Instructions upon contract or agreement completion or termination.</E> (1) The GCA provides instructions to the entity for returning or disposing of classified information upon contract or agreement completion or termination, or when an entity no longer has a legitimate need to retain or possess classified information.</P>
              <P>(2) The GCA also determines whether the entity may retain classified information for particular purposes after the contract or agreement terminates, and if so, provides written authorization to the entity along with any instructions or limitations (such as which information, for how long, etc).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 2004.32</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Determining entity eligibility for access to classified information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility determinations.</E> (1) The responsible CSA determines whether an entity is eligible for access to classified information. An entity may not have access to classified information until the responsible CSA determines that it meets all the requirements in this section. In general, the entity must be eligible to access classified information at the appropriate level before the CSA may consider any of the entity's subsidiaries, sub-contractors, or other sub-entities for eligibility. However, when the subsidiary will perform all classified work, the CSA may instead exclude the parent entity from access to classified information rather than determining its eligibility. In either case, the CSA must consider all information relevant to assessing whether the entity's access poses an unacceptable risk to national security interests.</P>
              <P>(2) A favorable access eligibility determination is not the same as a safeguarding capability determination. Entities may access classified information with a favorable eligibility determination, but may possess classified information only if the CSA determines both access eligibility and safeguarding capability, based on the GCA's requirement in the contract security classification specification (or equivalent).</P>
              <P>(3) If an entity has an existing eligibility determination, a CSA will not duplicate eligibility determination processes performed by another CSA. If a CSA cannot acknowledge an entity eligibility determination to another CSA, that entity may be subject to duplicate processing.</P>
              <P>(4) Each CSA maintains a record of its entities' eligibility determinations (or critical infrastructure entity eligibility status under the CCIPP, for DHS) and responds to inquiries from GCAs or entities, as appropriate and to the extent authorized by law, regarding the eligibility status of entities under their cognizance.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Process.</E> (1) The responsible CSA provides guidance to entities on the eligibility determination process and on how to maintain eligibility throughout the period of the agreement or as long as an entity continues to need access to classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. or foreign government requirement.<PRTPAGE P="515"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The CSA coordinates with appropriate authorities to determine whether an entity meets the eligibility criteria in paragraph (e) of this section. This includes coordinating with appropriate U.S. Government regulatory authorities to determine entity compliance with laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) An entity cannot apply for its own eligibility determination. A GCA or an eligible entity must sponsor the entity to the responsible CSA for an eligibility determination. The GCA or eligible entity may sponsor an entity at any point during the contracting or agreement life-cycle at which the entity must have access to classified information to participate (including the solicitation or competition phase). An entity with limited eligibility granted under paragraph (f) of this section may sponsor a sub-entity for a limited eligibility determination for the same contract, agreement, or circumstance so long as the sponsoring entity is not under FOCI (see § 2004.34(i)).</P>
              <P>(4) The GCA must include enough lead time in each phase of the acquisition or agreement cycle to accomplish all required security actions. Required security actions include any eligibility determination necessary for an entity to participate in that phase of the cycle. The GCA may award a contract or agreement before the CSA completes the entity eligibility determination. However, in such cases, the entity may not begin performance on portions of the contract or agreement that require access to classified information until the CSA makes a favorable entity eligibility determination.</P>
              <P>(5) When a CSA is unable to make an eligibility determination in sufficient time to qualify an entity to participate in the particular procurement action or phase that gave rise to the GCA request (this includes both solicitation and performance phases), the GCA may request that the CSA continue the determination process to qualify the entity for future classified work for any GCA, provided that the processing delay was not due to the entity's lack of cooperation. Once the CSA determines that an entity is eligible for access to classified information, but a GCA does not award a contract or agreement requiring access to classified information to the entity, or the entity's eligibility status changes, the CSA terminates the entity eligibility determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Coverage.</E> (1) A favorable eligibility determination allows an entity to access classified information at the determined eligibility level, or lower.</P>
              <P>(2) The CSA must ensure that all entities needing access to classified information as part of a legitimate U.S. or foreign government requirement have or receive a favorable eligibility determination before accessing classified information. This includes both prime or parent entities and sub-entities, even in cases in which an entity intends to have the classified work performed only by sub-entities. A prime or parent entity must have a favorable eligibility determination at the same classification level or higher than its sub-entity(ies), unless the CSA determined that the parent entity could be effectively excluded from access (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section).</P>
              <P>(3) If a parent and sub-entity need to share classified information with each other, the CSA must validate that both the parent and the sub-entity have favorable eligibility determinations at the level required for the classified information prior to sharing the information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">DHS Classified Critical Infrastructure Protection Program (CCIPP).</E> DHS shares classified cybersecurity information with certain employees of entities under the Classified Critical Infrastructure Protection Program (CCIPP). The CCIPP applies only to entities that do not need to store classified information, have no other contracts or agreements already requiring access to classified information, and are not already determined eligible for access to classified information. DHS establishes and implements procedures consistent with the NISP to determine CCIPP entity eligibility for access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Eligibility criteria.</E> An entity must meet the following requirements to be eligible to access classified information:</P>

              <P>(1) It must need to access classified information as part of a legitimate <PRTPAGE P="516"/>U.S. Government or foreign government requirement, and access must be consistent with U.S. national security interests as determined by the CSA;</P>
              <P>(2) It must be organized and existing under the laws of any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or an organized U.S. territory (Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands); or an American Indian or Alaska native tribe formally acknowledged by the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs, of the U.S. Department of the Interior;</P>
              <P>(3) It must be located in the United States or its territorial areas;</P>
              <P>(4) It must have a record of compliance with pertinent laws, regulations, and contracts (or other relevant agreements);</P>
              <P>(5) Its KMOs must each have and maintain eligibility for access to classified information that is at least the same level as the entity eligibility level;</P>
              <P>(6) It and all of its KMOs must not be excluded by a Federal agency, contract review board, or other authorized official from participating in Federal contracts or agreements;</P>
              <P>(7) It must meet all requirements the CSA or the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy establishes for access to the type of classified information or program involved; and</P>
              <P>(8) If the CSA determines the entity is under foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI), the responsible CSA must:</P>
              <P>(i) Agree that sufficient security measures are in place to mitigate or negate risk to national security interests due to the FOCI (see § 2004.34);</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine that it is appropriate to grant eligibility for a single, narrowly defined purpose (see § 2004.34(i)); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Determine that the entity is not eligible to access classified information.</P>
              <P>(9) DoD and DOE cannot award a contract involving access to proscribed information to an entity effectively owned or controlled by a foreign government unless the Secretary of the agency first issues a waiver (see 10 U.S.C. 2536). A waiver is not required if the CSA determines the entity is eligible and it agrees to establish a voting trust agreement (VTA) or proxy agreement (PA) (see § 2004.34(f)) because both VTAs and PAs effectively negate foreign government control.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Limited entity eligibility determination.</E> CSAs may choose to allow GCAs to request limited entity eligibility determinations (this is not the same as limited entity eligibility in situations involving FOCI when the FOCI is not mitigated or negated; for more information on limited entity eligibility in such FOCI cases, see § 2004.34(i)). If a CSA permits GCAs to request a limited entity eligibility determination, it must set out parameters within its implementing policies that are consistent with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The GCA, or an entity with limited eligibility, must first request a limited entity eligibility determination from the CSA for the relevant entity and provide justification for limiting eligibility in that case;</P>
              <P>(2) Limited entity eligibility is specific to the requesting GCA's classified information, and to a single, narrowly defined contract, agreement, or circumstance;</P>
              <P>(3) The entity must otherwise meet the requirements for entity eligibility set out in this part;</P>

              <P>(5) The CSA verifies limited entity eligibility determinations only to the requesting GCA or entity. In the case of multiple limited entity eligibility determinations for a single entity, the CSA verifies each one separately only to its requestor; and</P>
              <P>(6) CSAs administratively terminate the limited entity eligibility when there is no longer a need for access to the classified information for which the CSA approved the limited entity eligibility.</P>

              <P>(2) The responsible CSA revokes the entity's eligible status if the entity is <PRTPAGE P="517"/>unable or unwilling to protect classified information.</P>
              <P>(3) The CSA coordinates with the GCA(s) to take interim measures, as necessary, toward either termination or revocation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">FOCI determination.</E> A U.S. entity is under foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) when:</P>
              <P>(1) A foreign interest has the power to direct or decide matters affecting the entity's management or operations in a manner that could:</P>
              <P>(i) Result in unauthorized access to classified information; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Adversely affect performance of a contract or agreement requiring access to classified information; and</P>
              <P>(2) The foreign interest exercises that power:</P>
              <P>(i) Directly or indirectly;</P>
              <P>(ii) Through ownership of the U.S. entity's securities, by contractual arrangements, or other similar means;</P>

              <P>(iii) By the ability to control or influence the election or appointment of one or more members to the entity's governing board (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> board of directors, board of managers, board of trustees) or its equivalent; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Prospectively (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> is not currently exercising the power, but could).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">CSA guidance.</E> The CSA establishes guidance for entities on filling out and submitting a Standard Form (SF) 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests (OMB Control No. 0704-0194), and on reporting changes in circumstances that might result in a determination that the entity is under FOCI or is no longer under FOCI. The CSA also advises entities on the Government appeal channels for disputing CSA FOCI determinations.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">FOCI factors.</E> To determine whether an entity is under FOCI, the CSA analyzes available information to determine the existence, nature, and source of FOCI. The CSA:</P>
              <P>(1) Considers information the entity or its parent provides on the SF 328/CF 328 (OMB Control No. 0704-0194), and any other relevant information; and</P>
              <P>(2) Considers in the aggregate the following factors about the entity:</P>
              <P>(i) Record of espionage against U.S. targets, either economic or Government;</P>
              <P>(ii) Record of enforcement actions against the entity for transferring technology without authorization;</P>
              <P>(iii) Record of compliance with pertinent U.S. laws, regulations, and contracts or agreements;</P>
              <P>(iv) Type and sensitivity of the information the entity would access;</P>
              <P>(v) Source, nature, and extent of FOCI, including whether foreign interests hold a majority or minority position in the entity, taking into consideration the immediate, intermediate, and ultimate parent entities;</P>
              <P>(vi) Nature of any relevant bilateral and multilateral security and information exchange agreements;</P>
              <P>(vii) Ownership or control, in whole or in part, by a foreign government; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Any other factor that indicates or demonstrates foreign interest capability to control or influence the entity's operations or management.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Entity access while under FOCI.</E> (1) If the CSA is determining whether an entity is eligible to access classified information and finds that the entity is under FOCI, the CSA must consider the entity ineligible for access to classified information. The CSA and the entity may then attempt to negotiate FOCI mitigation or negation measures sufficient to permit a favorable eligibility determination.</P>
              <P>(2) The CSA may not determine that the entity is eligible to access classified information until the entity has put into place appropriate security measures to negate or mitigate FOCI or is otherwise no longer under FOCI. If the degree of FOCI is such that no mitigation or negation efforts will be sufficient, or access to classified information would be inconsistent with national security interests, then the CSA will determine the entity ineligible for access to classified information.</P>

              <P>(3) If an entity comes under FOCI, the CSA may allow the existing eligibility status to continue while the CSA and the entity negotiate acceptable FOCI mitigation or negation measures, as long as there is no indication that classified information is at risk. If the entity does not actively negotiate <PRTPAGE P="518"/>mitigation or negation measures in good faith, or there are no appropriate measures that will remove the possibility of unauthorized access to classified information or adverse effect on the entity's performance of contracts or agreements involving classified information, the CSA will take steps, in coordination with the GCA, to terminate eligibility.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">FOCI and entities under the CCIPP.</E> DHS may sponsor, as part of the CCIPP, a U.S. entity that is under FOCI, under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary of DHS proposes appropriate FOCI risk mitigation or negation measures (see paragraph (f) of this section) to the other CSAs and ensures the anticipated release of classified information:</P>
              <P>(i) Is authorized for release to the country involved;</P>
              <P>(ii) Does not include information classified under the Atomic Energy Act; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not impede or interfere with the entity's ability to manage and comply with regulatory requirements imposed by other Federal agencies, such as the State Department's International Traffic in Arms Regulation.</P>
              <P>(2) If the CSAs agree the mitigation or negation measures are sufficient, DHS may proceed to enter a CCIPP information sharing agreement with the entity. If one or more CSAs disagree, the Secretary of DHS may seek a decision from the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs before entering a CCIPP information sharing agreement with the entity.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Mitigation or negation measures to address FOCI.</E> (1) The CSA-approved mitigation or negation measures must assure that the entity can offset FOCI by effectively denying unauthorized people or entities access to classified information and preventing the foreign interest from adversely impacting the entity's performance on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(2) Any mitigation or negation measures the CSA approves for an entity must not impede or interfere with the entity's ability to manage and comply with regulatory requirements imposed by other Federal agencies (such as Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulation).</P>
              <P>(3) If the CSA approves a FOCI mitigation or negation measure for an entity, it may agree that the measure, or particular portions of it, may apply to all of the present and future sub-entities within the entity's organization.</P>
              <P>(4) Mitigation or negation measures are different for ownership versus control or influence.</P>
              <P>(5) Methods to mitigate foreign control or influence (unrelated to ownership) may include:</P>
              <P>(i) Assigning specific oversight duties and responsibilities to independent board members;</P>
              <P>(ii) Formulating special executive-level security committees to consider and oversee matters that affect entity performance on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information;</P>
              <P>(iii) Modifying or terminating loan agreements, contracts, agreements, and other understandings with foreign interests;</P>
              <P>(iv) Diversifying or reducing foreign-source income;</P>
              <P>(v) Demonstrating financial viability independent of foreign interests;</P>
              <P>(vi) Eliminating or resolving problem debt;</P>
              <P>(vii) Separating, physically or organizationally, the entity component performing on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information;</P>
              <P>(viii) Adopting special board resolutions;</P>
              <P>(ix) A combination of these methods, as determined by the CSA; or</P>
              <P>(x) Other actions that effectively negate or mitigate foreign control or influence.</P>
              <P>(6) Methods to mitigate or negate foreign ownership include:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Board resolutions.</E> The CSA and the entity may agree to a board resolution when a foreign interest does not own voting interests sufficient to elect, or is otherwise not entitled to representation on, the entity's governing board. The resolution must identify the foreign shareholders and their representatives (if any), note the extent of foreign ownership, certify that the foreign shareholders and their representatives will not require, will not have, and can <PRTPAGE P="519"/>be effectively excluded from, access to all classified information, and certify that the entity will not permit the foreign shareholders and their representatives to occupy positions that might enable them to influence the entity's policies and practices, affecting its performance on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Security control agreements (SCAs).</E> The CSA and the entity may agree to use an SCA when a foreign interest does not effectively own or control an entity (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the entity is under U.S. control), but the foreign interest is entitled to representation on the entity's governing board. At least one cleared U.S. citizen must serve as an outside director on the entity's governing board.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Special security agreements (SSAs).</E> The CSA and the entity may agree to use an SSA when a foreign interest effectively owns or controls an entity. The SSA preserves the foreign owner's right to be represented on the entity's board or governing body with a direct voice in the entity's business management, while denying the foreign owner majority representation and unauthorized access to classified information. When a GCA requires an entity to have access to proscribed information, and the CSA proposes an SSA as the mitigation measure, the CSA makes a national interest determination (NID) as part of determining an entity's eligibility for access. See paragraph (h) of this section for more information on NIDs.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Voting trust agreements (VTAs) or proxy agreements (PAs).</E> The CSA and the entity may agree to use one of these measures when a foreign interest effectively owns or controls an entity. The VTA and PA are arrangements that vest the voting rights of the foreign-owned stock in cleared U.S. citizens approved by the CSA. Under the VTA, the foreign owner transfers legal title in the entity to the trustees approved by the CSA. Under the PA, the foreign owner conveys their voting rights to proxy holders approved by the CSA. The entity must be organized, structured, and financed to be capable of operating as a viable business entity independently from the foreign owner. Both VTAs and PAs can effectively negate foreign ownership and control; therefore, neither imposes any restrictions on the entity's eligibility to have access to classified information or to compete for contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information, including those involving proscribed information. Both VTAs and PAs can also effectively negate foreign government control.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Combinations of the measures in paragraphs (f)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section or other similar measures that effectively mitigate or negate the risks involved with foreign ownership.</E> CSAs must identify combination agreements in a way that distinguishes them from other agreements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a combination SSA-proxy agreement cannot be identified as either an SSA or a proxy agreement beause those names would not distinguish the combination agreement from either of the other types). CSAs must also coordinate terms in combination agreements with the controlling agency prior to releasing proscribed information.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Standards for FOCI mitigation or negation measures.</E> The CSA must include the following requirements as part of any FOCI mitigation or negation measures, to ensure that entities implement necessary security and governing controls:</P>
              <P>(1) Annual certification and annual compliance reports by the entity's governing board and the KMOs;</P>
              <P>(2) The U.S. Government remedies in case the entity is not adequately protecting classified information or not adhering to the provisions of the mitigation or negation measure;</P>

              <P>(3) Supplements to FOCI mitigation or negation measures as the CSA deems necessary. In addition to the standard FOCI mitigation or negation measure's requirements, the CSA may require more procedures via a supplement, based upon the circumstances of an entity's operations. The CSA may place these requirements in supplements to the FOCI mitigation or negation measure to allow flexibility as circumstances change without having to renegotiate the entire measure. When making use of supplements, the CSA does not consider the FOCI mitigation <PRTPAGE P="520"/>measure final until it approves the required supplements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> technology control plan, electronic communication plan); and</P>
              <P>(4) For agreements to mitigate or negate ownership (PAs, VTAs, SSAs, and SCAs), the following additional requirements apply:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">FOCI oversight.</E> The CSA verifies that the entity establishes an oversight body consisting of trustees, proxy holders or outside directors, as applicable, and those officers or directors whom the CSA determines are eligible for access to classified information (see § 2004.36). The entity's security officer is the principal advisor to the oversight body and attends their meetings. The oversight body:</P>
              <P>(A) Maintains policies and procedures to safeguard classified information in the entity's possession with no adverse impact on performance of contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information; and</P>
              <P>(B) Verifies the entity is complying with the FOCI mitigation or negation measure and related documents, contract security requirements or equivalent, and the NISP;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Qualifications of trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors.</E> The CSA determines eligibility for access to classified information for trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors at the classification level of the entity's eligibility determination. Trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors must meet the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(A) Be a U.S. citizen residing in the United States who can exercise management prerogatives relating to their position in a way that ensures that the foreign owner can be effectively insulated from the entity or effectively separated from the entity's classified work;</P>
              <P>(B) Be completely disinterested individuals with no prior involvement with the entity, the entities with which it is affiliated, or the foreign owner and its affiliates. Individuals who are serving as trustees, proxy holders, or outside directors as part of a mitigation measure for the entity are not considered to have prior involvement solely by performing that role; and</P>
              <P>(C) Be involved in no other circumstances that may affect an individual's ability to serve effectively, such as the number of boards on which the individual serves or the length of time serving on any other boards;</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Annual meeting.</E> The CSA meets at least annually with the oversight body to review the purpose and effectiveness of the FOCI mitigation or negation agreement; establish a common understanding of the operating requirements and their implementation; and provide guidance on matters related to FOCI mitigation and industrial security. These meetings include a CSA review of:</P>
              <P>(A) Compliance with the approved FOCI mitigation or negation measure;</P>
              <P>(B) Problems regarding practical implementation of the mitigation or negation measure; and</P>
              <P>(C) Security controls, practices, or procedures and whether they warrant adjustment; and</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Annual certification.</E> The CSA reviews the entity's annual report; addresses, and resolves issues identified in the report; and documents the results of this review and any follow-up actions.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">National interest determination (NID)</E>—(1) <E T="03">Requirement for a NID.</E> (i) The CSA must determine whether allowing an entity access to proscribed information under an SSA is consistent with national security interests of the United States as part of making an entity eligibility determination in cases in which:</P>
              <P>(A) The GCA requires an entity to have access to proscribed information;</P>
              <P>(B) The entity is under FOCI; and</P>
              <P>(C) The CSA proposes an SSA to mitigate the FOCI.</P>
              <P>(ii) This determination is called a national interest determination (NID). A favorable NID confirms that an entity's access to the proscribed information under an SSA is consistent with national security interests. If the CSA is unable to render a favorable NID, it must consider other FOCI mitigation measures instead of an SSA or reassess the entity's eligibility for access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">NID process.</E> (i) The CSA makes the NID for any categories of proscribed information for which the entity requires access.<PRTPAGE P="521"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) In cases in which any category of the proscribed information is controlled by another agency (ODNI for SCI, DOE for RD, NSA for COMSEC), the CSA asks that controlling agency to concur on the NID for that category of information.</P>
              <P>(iii) The CSA informs the GCA and the entity when the NID is complete. In cases involving SCI, RD, or COMSEC, the CSA also informs the GCA and the entity when a controlling agency concurs or non-concurs on that agency's category of proscribed information. The entity may begin accessing a category of proscribed information once the CSA informs the GCA and the entity that the controlling agency concurs, even if other categories of proscribed information are pending concurrence.</P>
              <P>(iv) An entity's access to SCI, RD, or COMSEC remains in effect so long as the entity remains eligible for access to classified information and the contract or agreement (or program or project) which imposes the requirement for access to those categories of proscribed information remains in effect, except under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(A) The CSA, GCA, or controlling agency becomes aware of adverse information that impacts the entity eligibility determination;</P>
              <P>(B) The CSA's threat assessment pertaining to the entity indicates a risk to one of the categories of proscribed information;</P>
              <P>(C) The CSA becomes aware of any material change regarding the source, nature, and extent of FOCI; or</P>
              <P>(D) The entity's record of NISP compliance, based on CSA reviews in accordance with § 2004.26, becomes less than satisfactory.</P>
              <P>(v) Under any of these circumstances, the CSA determines whether an entity may continue being eligible for access to classified information, it must change the FOCI mitigation measure in order to remain eligible, or the CSA must terminate or revoke access.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Process for concurring or non-concurring on a NID.</E> (i) Each controlling agency tells the CSAs what information the controlling agency requires to consider a NID. ODNI identifies the information it requires to assess a NID for access to SCI, DOE identifies the information it requires to assess a NID for access to RD, and NSA identifies the information it requires to assess a NID for access to COMSEC.</P>
              <P>(ii) The CSA requests from the GCA justification for access, a description of the proscribed information involved, and other information the controlling agency requires to concur or non-concur on the NID.</P>
              <P>(iii) The CSA requests concurrence on the NID from the controlling agency for the relevant category of proscribed information (ODNI for SCI, DOE for RD, NSA for COMSEC), and provides the information that controlling agency identified.</P>
              <P>(iv) The relevant controlling agency (ODNI for SCI, DOE for RD, NSA for COMSEC) responds in writing to the CSA's request for concurrence.</P>
              <P>(A) The controlling agency may concur with the NID for access under a particular contract or agreement, access under a program or project, or for all future access to the same category of proscribed information.</P>

              <P>(B) If the relevant controlling agency does not concur with the NID, the controlling agency informs the CSA in writing, citing the reasons why it does not concur. The CSA notifies the applicable GCA and, in coordination with the GCA, then notifies the entity. The entity cannot have access to the category of proscribed information under the control of that agency (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> if ODNI does not concur, the entity may not have access to SCI; if DOE does not concur, the entity may not have access to RD; and if NSA does not concur, the entity may not have access to COMSEC). The CSA, in consultation with the applicable GCA, must decide whether the reason the controlling agency did not concur otherwise affects the entity's eligibility for access to classified information (see § 2004.32(g)), or requires changing the FOCI mitigation measure (see paragraph (f) of this section).</P>

              <P>(v) When an entity is eligible for access to classified information that includes a favorable NID for SCI, RD, or COMSEC, the CSA does not have to request a new NID concurrence for the same entity if the access requirements for the relevant category of proscribed <PRTPAGE P="522"/>information and terms remain unchanged for:</P>
              <P>(A) Renewing the contract or agreement;</P>
              <P>(B) New task orders issued under the contract or agreement;</P>
              <P>(C) A new contract or agreement that contains the same provisions as the previous one (this usually applies when the contract or agreement is for a program or project); or</P>
              <P>(D) Renewing the SSA.</P>
              <P>(vi) When making the decision whether or not to concur with a NID for proscribed information under its control, the controlling agency will not duplicate work already performed by the GCA during the contract award process or by the CSA when determining entity eligibility for access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Timing for concurrence process.</E> (i) The CSA requests NID concurrence from the controlling agency as soon as the CSA has made a NID, if the entity needs access to SCI, RD, or COMSEC.</P>
              <P>(ii) The controlling agency provides a final, written concurrence or non-concurrence to the CSA within 30 days after receiving the request for concurrence from the CSA.</P>
              <P>(iii) In cases when a controlling agency requires clarification or additional information from the CSA, the controlling agency responds to the CSA within 30 days to request clarification or additional information as needed, and to coordinate a plan and timeline for concurring or non-concurring. The controlling agency must provide written updates to the CSA every 30 days until it concurs or non-concurs. In turn, the CSA provides the GCA and the entity with updates every 30 days.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Limited eligibility determinations (for entities under FOCI without mitigation or negation).</E> (1) In exceptional circumstances when an entity is under FOCI, the CSA may decide that limited eligibility for access to classified information is appropriate when the entity is unable or unwilling to implement FOCI mitigation or negation measures (this is not the same as limited eligibility in other circumstances; for more information on limited eligibility in other cases, see § 2004.32(f)).</P>
              <P>(2) The GCA first decides whether to request a limited eligibility determination for the entity and must articulate a compelling need for it to the CSA that is in accordance with U.S. national security interests. The GCA must verify to the CSA that access to classified information is essential to contract or agreement performance, and accept the risk inherent in not mitigating or negating the FOCI. See § 2004.32(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(3) The CSA may grant a limited eligibility determination if the GCA requests and the entity meets all other eligibility criteria in § 2004.32(e).</P>

              <P>(4) A foreign government may sponsor a U.S. sub-entity of a foreign entity for limited eligibility when the foreign government desires to award a contract or agreement to the U.S. sub-entity that involves access to classified information for which the foreign government is the original classification authority (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> foreign government information), and there is no other need for the U.S. sub-entity to have access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(5) Limited eligibility determinations are specific to the classified information of the requesting GCA or foreign government, and specific to a single, narrowly defined contract, agreement, or circumstance of that GCA or foreign government.</P>
              <P>(6) The access limitations of a favorable limited eligibility determination apply to all of the entity's employees, regardless of citizenship.</P>
              <P>(7) A limited eligibility determination is not an option for entities that require access to proscribed information when a foreign government has ownership or control over the entity. See § 2004.32(e)(9).</P>
              <P>(8) The CSA administratively terminates the entity's limited eligibility when there is no longer a need for access to the classified information for which the CSA made the favorable limited eligibility determination. Terminating one limited eligibility status does not impact other ones the entity may have.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Making employee eligibility determinations.</E> (1) The responsible CSA:<PRTPAGE P="523"/>
              </P>

              <P>(i) Determines whether entity employees meet the criteria established in the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). Entity employees must have a legitimate requirement (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> need to know) for access to classified information in the performance of assigned duties and eligibility must be clearly consistent with the interest of the national security.</P>
              <P>(ii) Notifies entities of its determinations of employee eligibility for access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(iii) Terminates eligibility status when there is no longer a need for access to classified information by entity employees.</P>
              <P>(2) The responsible CSA maintains:</P>
              <P>(i) SF 312s, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreements, or other approved nondisclosure agreements, executed by entity employees, as prescribed by ODNI in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.80 and E.O. 13526; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Records of its entity employee eligibility determinations, suspensions, and revocations.</P>
              <P>(3) CSAs ensure that entities limit the number of employees with access to classified information to the minimum number necessary to work on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information.</P>
              <P>(4) The CSA determines the need for event-driven reinvestigations for entity employees.</P>
              <P>(5) CSAs use the Federal Investigative Standards (FIS) issued jointly by the Suitability and Security Executive Agents.</P>
              <P>(6) The CSA provides guidance to entities on:</P>
              <P>(i) Requesting employee eligibility determinations, to include guidance for submitting fingerprints; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Granting employee access to classified information when the employee has had a break in access or a break in employment.</P>
              <P>(7) If the CSA receives adverse information about an eligible entity employee, the CSA should consider and possibly investigate, as authorized, to determine whether the employee's eligibility to access classified information remains clearly consistent with the interests of national security. If the CSA determines that an entity employee's continued eligibility is not in the interest of national security, the CSA implements procedures leading to suspension and ultimate revocation of the employee's eligible status, and notifies the entity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultants.</E> A consultant is an individual under contract or agreement to provide professional or technical assistance to an entity in a capacity requiring access to classified information. A consultant is considered an entity employee for security purposes. The CSA makes eligibility determinations for entity consultants in the same way it does for entity employees.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reciprocity.</E> The responsible CSA determines if an entity employee was previously investigated or determined eligible by another CSA. CSAs reciprocally accept existing employee eligibility determinations in accordance with applicable and current national level personnel security policy, and must not duplicate employee eligibility investigations conducted by another CSA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limited access authorization (LAA).</E> (1) CSAs may make LAA determinations for non-U.S. citizen entity employees in rare circumstances, when:</P>
              <P>(i) A non-U.S. citizen employee possesses unique or unusual skill or expertise that the agency urgently needs to support a specific U.S. Government contract or agreement; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A U.S. citizen with those skills is not available.</P>
              <P>(2) A CSA may grant LAAs up to the secret classified level.</P>
              <P>(3) CSAs may not use LAAs for access to:</P>
              <P>(i) Top secret (TS) information;</P>
              <P>(ii) RD or FRD information;</P>
              <P>(iii) Information that a Government-designated disclosure authority has not determined releasable to the country of which the individual is a citizen;</P>
              <P>(iv) COMSEC information;</P>
              <P>(v) Intelligence information, to include SCI;</P>

              <P>(vi) NATO information, except as follows: Foreign nationals of a NATO member nation may be authorized access to NATO information subject to the terms of the contract, if the responsible CSA obtains a NATO security <PRTPAGE P="524"/>clearance certificate from the individual's country of citizenship. NATO access is limited to performance on a specific NATO contract;</P>
              <P>(vii) Information for which the U.S. Government has prohibited foreign disclosure in whole or in part; or</P>
              <P>(viii) Information provided to the U.S. Government by another government that is classified or provided in confidence.</P>
              <P>(4) The responsible CSA provides specific procedures to entities for requesting LAAs. The GCA must concur on an entity's LAA request before the CSA may grant it.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Safeguarding and marking.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Safeguarding approval.</E> (1) The CSA determines whether an entity's safeguarding capability meets requirements established in 32 CFR part 2001, and other applicable national level policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Atomic Energy Act for RD). If the CSA makes a favorable determination, the entity may store classified information at that level or below. If the determination is not favorable, the CSA must ensure that the entity does not possess classified information or does not possess information at the classification level denied or a higher level.</P>
              <P>(2) The CSA maintains records of its safeguarding capability determinations and, upon request from GCAs or entities, and as appropriate and to the extent authorized by law, verifies that it has made a favorable safeguarding determination for a given entity and at what level.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Marking.</E> The GCA provides guidance to entities that meets requirements in 32 CFR 2001.22, 2001.23, 2001.24, and 2001.25, Derivative classification, Classification marking in the electronic environment, Additional requirements, and Declassification markings; ISOO's marking guide, <E T="03">Marking Classified National Security Information;</E> and other applicable national level policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Atomic Energy Act for RD) for marking classified information and material.</P>

              <P>(a) The responsible CSA must authorize an entity information system before the entity can use it to process classified information. The CSA must use the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy information to make a timely, credible, and risk-based decision whether to authorize an entity's system.</P>
              <P>(b) The responsible CSA issues to entities guidance that establishes protection measures for entity information systems that process classified information. The responsible CSA must base the guidance on standards applicable to Federal systems, which must include the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), Public Law 113-283, and may include National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications, Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) publications, and Federal information processing standards (FIPS).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Insofar as the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) applies to the National Security Council (hereafter NSC), it provides the American public with expanded opportunities to gain access to records maintained by the NSC Staff which may pertain to them as individuals. These regulations are the exclusive means by which individuals may request personally identifiable records and information from the National Security Council.</P>

            <P>(b) The NSC Staff, in addition to performing the functions prescribed in the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. 401), also serves as the supporting staff to the President in the conduct of foreign affairs. In doing so the NSC Staff is acting not as an agency but as an extension of the White House Office. In that the White House Office is not considered an agency for the purposes of this Act, the materials which are used by NSC Staff personnel in their role as supporting staff to the President are not subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. A description of these White House Office files is, nevertheless, appended to the NSC notices of systems of files and will be published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(c) In general, Records in NSC files pertain to individual members of the public only if these individuals have been (1) employed by the NSC, (2) have corresponded on a foreign policy matter with a member of the NSC or its staff, or (3) have, as a U.S. Government official, participated in an NSC meeting or in the preparation of foreign policy-related documents for the NSC.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The following regulations set forth procedures whereby individuals may seek and gain access to records concerning themselves and will guide the NSC Staff response to requests under the Privacy Act. In addition, they outline the requirements applicable to the personnel maintaining NSC systems of records.</P>
            <P>(b) These regulations, published pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-579, Section 552a (f) and (k), 5 U.S.C. (hereinafter the Act), advise of procedures whereby an individual can:</P>
            <P>(1) Request notification of whether the NSC Staff maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to him or her in any non-exempt system of records;</P>
            <P>(2) Request a copy of such record or an accounting of that disclosure;</P>
            <P>(3) Request an amendment to a record; and,</P>
            <P>(4) Appeal any initial adverse determination of any request under the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) These regulations also specify those systems of records which the NSC has determined to be exempt from certain provisions of the Act and thus not subject to procedures established by this regulation.</P>

            <P>(a) Individuals desiring to determine if they are the subject of a record or system of records maintained by the NSC Staff should address their inquiries, marking them plainly as a <E T="03">PRIVACY ACT REQUEST,</E> to:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Staff Secretary, National Security Council, Room 374, Old Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20506.</FP>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <FP>All requests must be made in writing and should contain:</FP>
            <P>(1) A specific reference to the system of records maintained by the NSC as listed in the NSC Notices of Systems and Records (copies available upon request); or</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the record or systems of records in sufficient detail to allow the NSC to determine whether the record does, in fact, exist in an NSC system of records.</P>
            <P>(b) All requests must contain the printed or typewritten name of the individual to whom the record pertains, the signature of the individual making the request, and the address to which the reply should be sent. In instances when the identification is insufficient to insure disclosure to the individual to whom the information pertains in view of the sensitivity of the information, NSC reserves the right to solicit from the requestor additional identifying information.</P>

            <P>(c) Responses to all requests under the Act will be made by the Staff Secretary, or by another designated member of the NSC Staff authorized to act in the name of the Staff Secretary in responding to a request under this Act. Every effort will be made to inform the requestor if he or she is the subject of a specific record or system of records within ten working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal Federal Holidays) of receipt of the request. Such a response will also contain the procedures to be followed in order to gain access to any record which may exist and a copy of the most recent NSC notice, as published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> on the system of records in which the record is contained.</P>
            <P>(d) Whenever it is not possible to respond in the time period specified above, the NSC Staff Secretary or a designated alternate will, within ten working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal Federal Holidays), inform the requestor of the reasons for the delay (e.g., insufficient requestor information, difficulties in record location, etc.), steps that need to be taken in order to expedite the request, and the date by which a response is anticipated.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for access to a record.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Individuals requesting access to a record or system of records in which there is information concerning them must address a request in writing to the Staff Secretary of the NSC (see § 2102.1). Due to restricted access to NSC offices in the Old Executive Office Building where the files are located, requests cannot be made in person.</P>
            <P>(b) All written requests should contain a concise description of the records to which access is requested. In addition, the requestor should include any other information which he or she feels would assist in the timely identification of the record. Verification of the requestor's identity will be determined under the same procedures used in requests for learning of the existence of a record.</P>

            <P>(c) To the extent possible, any request for access will be answered by <PRTPAGE P="531"/>the Staff Secretary or a designated alternate within ten working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) of the receipt of the request. In the event that a response cannot be made within this time, the requestor will be notified by mail of the reasons for the delay and the date upon which a reply can be expected.</P>
            <P>(d) The NSC response will forward a copy of the requested materials unless further identification or clarification of the request is required. In the event access is denied, the requestor shall be informed of the reasons therefore and the name and address of the individual to whom an appeal should be directed.</P>

            <P>(a) Individuals wishing to amend a record contained in the NSC systems of records pertaining to them must submit a request in writing to the Staff Secretary of the NSC in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.</P>
            <P>(b) All requests for amendment or correction of a record must state concisely the reason for requesting the amendment. Such requests should include a brief statement which describes the information the requestor believes to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unnecessary and the amendment or correction desired.</P>
            <P>(c) To the extent possible, every request for amendment of a record will be answered within ten working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) of the receipt of the request. In the event that a response cannot be made within this time, the requestor will be notified by mail of the reasons for the delay and the date upon which a reply can be expected. A final response to a request for amendment will include the NSC Staff determination on whether to grant or deny the request. If the request is denied, the response will include:</P>
            <P>(1) The reasons for the decision;</P>
            <P>(2) The name and address of the individual to whom an appeal should be directed;</P>
            <P>(3) A description of the process for review of the appeal within the NSC; and</P>

              <P>The purpose of this regulation is to ensure, consistent with the authorities listed in § 2103.1, that national security information processed by the National Security Council Staff is protected from unauthorized disclosure, but only to the extent, and for such period, as is necessary to safeguard the national security.</P>

              <P>This regulation governs the National Security Council Staff Information Security Program. In consonance with the authorities listed in § 2103.1, it establishes the policy and procedures for the security classification, downgrading, declassification, and safeguarding of information that is owned by, is produced for or by, or is under the control of the National Security Council Staff.</P>

              <P>Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher than is necessary, shall be avoided. If there is reasonable doubt as to which designation in section 1-1 of Executive Order 12065 is appropriate, or whether information should be classified at all, the less restrictive designation should be used, or the information should not be classified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duration of original classification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Original classification may be extended beyond six years only by officials with Top Secret classification authority. This extension authority shall be used only when these officials determine that the basis for original classification will continue throughout the entire period that the classification will be in effect and only for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(a) The information is “foreign government information” as defined by the authorities in § 2301.1;</P>
              <P>(b) The information reveals intelligence sources and methods;</P>
              <P>(c) The information pertains to communication security;</P>
              <P>(d) The information reveals vulnerability or capability data, the unauthorized disclosure of which can reasonably be expected to render ineffective a system, installation, or project important to the national security;</P>
              <P>(e) The information concerns plans important to the national security, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably can be expected to nullify the effectiveness of the plan;</P>

              <P>(f) The information concerns specific foreign relations matters, the continued protection of which is essential to the national security;<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) Disclosure of the information would place a person's life in immediate jeopardy; or</P>
              <P>(h) The continued protection of the information is specifically required by statute.</P>
              <FP>Even when the extension authority is exercised, the period of original classification shall not be greater than twenty years from the date or original classification, except that the original classification of “foreign government information” pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be for a period of thirty years.</FP>

              <SUBJECT>Challenges to classification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>If holders of classified information believe that the information is improperly or unnecessarily classified, or that original classification has been extended for too long a period, they should discuss the matter with their immediate superiors or the classifier of the information. If these discussions do not satisfy the concerns of the challenger, the matter should be brought to the attention of the chairperson of the NSC Information Security Oversight Committee (see § 2103.51 of this part).</P>

              <P>Derivative classification is the act of assigning a level of classification to information that is determined to be the same in substance as information that is currently classified. Thus, derivative classification may be accomplished by any person cleared for access to that level of information, regardless of whether the person has original classification authority at that level.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basic policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Except as provided in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, Executive Order 12356, as implemented by Directive No. 1 and this Regulation, provides the only basis for classifying information. The policy of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is to make available to the public as much information concerning its activities as is possible, consistent with its responsibility to protect the national security. Information may not be classified unless its disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 2400.6</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Classification levels.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) National security information (hereinafter “classified information”) shall be classified at one of the following three levels:</P>
              <P>(1) “Top Secret” shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.</P>
              <P>(2) “Secret” shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security.</P>
              <P>(3) “Confidential” shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be used to identify classified information. Markings other than “Top Secret,” “Secret,” and “Confidential,” such as “For Official Use Only,” shall not be used to identify national security information. In addition, no other term or phrase shall be used in conjunction with one of the three authorized classification levels, such as “Secret Sensitive” or “Agency Confidential.” The terms “Top Secret”, “Secret”, and “Confidential” should not be used to identify nonclassified executive branch information.</P>
              <P>(c) Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher than is necessary shall be scrupulously avoided.</P>
              <P>(d) If there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify information, it shall be safeguarded as if it were classified “Confidential” pending a determination by an original classification authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days. If there is reasonable doubt about the appropriate level of classification the originator of the information shall safeguard it at the higher level of classification pending a determination by an original classification authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days. Upon the determination of a need for classification and/or the proper classification level, the information that is classified shall be marked as provided in § 2400.12 of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) Authority for original classification of information as Top Secret shall be exercised within OSTP only by the <PRTPAGE P="541"/>Director and by such principal subordinate officials having frequent need to exercise such authority as the Director shall designate in writing.</P>
              <P>(b) The authority to classify information originally as Secret shall be exercised within OSTP only by the Director, other officials delegated in writing to have original Top Secret classification authority, and any other officials delegated in writing to have original Secret classification authority.</P>
              <P>(c) The authority to classify information originally as Confidential shall be exercised within OSTP only by officials with original Top Secret or Secret classification authority and any officials delegated in writing to have original Confidential classification authority.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limitations on delegation of original classification authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Director, OSTP is the only official authorized to delegate original classification authority.</P>
              <P>(b) Delegations of original classification authority shall be held to an absolute minimum.</P>
              <P>(c) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the level of classification required.</P>
              <P>(d) Original classification authority shall not be delegated to OSTP personnel who only quote, restate, extract or paraphrase, or summarize classified information or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide.</P>
              <P>(e) The Executive Director, OSTP, shall maintain a current listing of persons or positions receiving any delegation of original classification authority. If possible, this listing shall be unclassified.</P>
              <P>(f) Original classification authority may not be redelegated.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exceptional Cases.</E> When an employee, contractor, licensee, or grantee of OSTP that does not have original classification authority originates information believed by that person to require classification, the information shall be protected in a manner consistent with these Regulations as provided in § 2400.6(d) of this part. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided in these Regulations to the official in OSTP who has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority with respect to this information. That official shall decide within thirty (30) days whether to classify this information. If the information is not within OSTP's area of classification responsibility, OSTP shall promptly transmit the information to the responsible agency. If it is not clear which agency has classification responsibility for this information, it shall be sent to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. The Director shall determine the agency having primary subject matter interest and forward the information, with appropriate recommendations, to that agency for a classification determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Classification requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Information may be classified only if it concerns one or more of the categories cited in Executive Order 12356, as subcategorized below, <E T="03">and</E> an official having original classification authority determines that its unauthorized disclosure, either by itself or in the context of other information, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</P>
              <P>(1) Military plans, weapons or operations;</P>
              <P>(2) The vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or plans relating to the national security;</P>
              <P>(3) Foreign government information;</P>
              <P>(4) Intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence sources or methods;</P>
              <P>(5) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</P>
              <P>(6) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security;</P>
              <P>(7) United States Government programs for safe-guarding nuclear materials or facilities;</P>
              <P>(8) Cryptology;</P>
              <P>(9) A confidential source; or</P>

              <P>(10) Other categories of information which are related to national security and that require protection against unauthorized disclosure as determined by the Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy. Each such determination shall be reported promptly to <PRTPAGE P="542"/>the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</P>
              <P>(b) Foreign government information need not fall within any other classification category listed in paragraph (a) of this section to be classified.</P>
              <P>(c) Certain information which would otherwise be unclassified may require classification when combined or associated with other unclassified or classified information. Classification on this basis shall be fully supported by a written explanation that, at a minimum, shall be maintained with the file or referenced on the record copy of the information.</P>
              <P>(d) Information classified in accordance with this section shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unofficial publication or inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure in the United States or abroad of identical or similar information. Following an inadvertent or unauthorized publication or disclosure of information identical or similar to information that has been classified in accordance with Executive Order 12356 or predecessor orders, OSTP, if the agency of primary interest, shall determine the degree of damage to the national security, the need for continued classification, and in coordination with the agency in which the disclosure occurred, what action must be taken to prevent similar occurrences. If the agency of primary interest is other than OSTP, the matter shall be referred to that agency.</P>

              <P>(a) Information shall be classified as long as required by national security considerations. When it can be determined, a specific date or event for declassification shall be set by the original classification authority at the time the information is originally classified.</P>
              <P>(b) Automatic declassification determinations under predecessor Executive Orders shall remain valid unless the classification is extended by an authorized official of the originating agency. These extensions may be by individual documents or categories of information. The originating agency shall be responsible for notifying holders of the information of such extensions.</P>
              <P>(c) Information classified under predecessor Executive Orders and marked for declassification review shall remain classified until reviewed for declassification under the provisions of Executive Order 12356.</P>
              <P>(d) Information classified under predecessor Executive Orders that does not bear a specific date or event for declassification shall remain classified until reviewed for declassification. The authority to extend the classification of information subject to automatic declassification under predecessor Orders is limited to those officials who have classification authority over the information and are designated in writing to have original classification authority at the level of the information to remain classified. Any decision to extend this classification on other than a document-by-document basis shall be reported to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</P>

              <P>(a) At the time of original classification, the following information shall be shown on the face of all classified documents, or clearly associated with other forms of classified information in a manner appropriate to the medium involved, unless this information itself would reveal a confidential source or relationship not otherwise evident in the document or information:</P>
              <P>(1) One of the three classification levels defined in § 2400.6 of this part;</P>
              <P>(2) The identity of the original classification authority if other than the person whose name appears as the approving or signing official;</P>
              <P>(3) The agency and office of origin; and</P>
              <P>(4) The date or event for declassification, or the notation “Originating Agency's Determination Required.”</P>

              <P>(b) Each classified document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which portions are not classified. The <PRTPAGE P="543"/>Director OSTP may, for good cause, grant and revoke waivers of this requirement for specified classes of documents or information. The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall be notified of any waivers.</P>

              <P>(a) In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; to restrain competition; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of national security.</P>
              <P>(b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security may not be classified.</P>
              <P>(c) The Director may reclassify information previously declassified and disclosed if it is determined in writing that (1) the information requires protection in the interest of national security; and (2) the information may reasonably be recovered. These reclassification actions shall be reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. Before reclassifying any information, the Director shall consider the factors listed in § 2001.6 of Directive No. 1, which shall be addressed in the report to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</P>
              <P>(d) Information may be classified or reclassified after OSTP has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552), or the mandatory review provisions of Executive Order 12356 (section 3.4) if such classification meets the requirements of this Order and is accomplished personally and on a document-by-document basis by the Director.</P>

              <P>(a) Derivative classification is (1) the determination that information is in substance the same as information currently classified, and (2) the application of the same classification markings. Persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original classification authority. If a person who applies derivative classification markings believes that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of classified information has changed the level of or removed the basis for classification, that person must consult an appropriate official of the originating agency or office of origin who has the authority to declassify, downgrade or upgrade the information.</P>
              <P>(b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Observe and respect original classification decisions; and</P>
              <P>(2) Carry forward to any newly created documents any assigned authorized markings. The declassification date or event that provides the longest period of classification shall be used for documents classified on the basis of multiple sources.</P>

              <P>(b) The classification guides shall be approved, in writing, by the Director or by officials having Top Secret original <PRTPAGE P="544"/>classification authority. Such approval constitutes an original classification decision.</P>
              <P>(c) Each classification guide shall specify the information subject to classification in sufficient detail to permit its ready and uniform identification and categorization and shall set forth the classification level and duration in each instance. Additionally, each classification guide shall prescribe declassification instructions for each element of information in terms of (1) a period of time, (2) the occurrence of an event, or (3) a notation that the information shall not be automatically declassified without the approval of OSTP.</P>
              <P>(d) The classification guides shall be kept current and shall be fully reviewed at least every two years. The Executive Director, OSTP shall maintain a list of all OSTP classification guides in current use.</P>
              <P>(e) The Executive Director, OSTP shall receive and maintain the record copy of all approved classification guides and changes thereto. He will assist the originator in determining the required distribution.</P>
              <P>(f) The Director may, for good cause, grant and revoke waivers of the requirement to prepare classification guides for specified classes of documents or information. The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall be notified of any waivers. The Director's decision to waive the requirement to issue classification guides for specific classes of documents or information will be based, at a minimum, on an evaluation of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) The ability to segregate and describe the elements of information;</P>
              <P>(2) The practicality of producing or disseminating the guide because of the nature of the information;</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all information classified under Executive Order 12356 or predecessor orders shall be subject to a review for declassification by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, if:</P>
              <P>(1) The request is made by a United States citizen or permanent resident alien, a federal agency, or a State or local government; and</P>
              <P>(2) The request is made in writing and describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable the Office of Science and Technology Policy to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort.</P>
              <P>(b) Requests should be addressed to: Executive Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC 20506.</P>
              <P>(c) If the request does not reasonably describe the information sought to allow identification of documents containing such information, the requester shall be notified that unless additional information is provided or the request is made more specific, no further action will be taken.</P>

              <P>(d) Information originated by a President, the White House Staff, by committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the President, or others specifically providing advice and counsel to a President or acting on behalf of a <PRTPAGE P="546"/>President is exempted from the mandatory review provisions of § 2400.24(a) of this part. The Archivist of the United States shall have the authority to review, downgrade and declassify information under the control of the Administrator of General Services or the Archivist pursuant to sections 2107, 2107 note, or 2203 of title 44, United States Code.

              <P>(2) Notify the requester of the referral unless the agency to which the request is referred objects to such notice on grounds that its association with the information requires protection; and</P>
              <P>(3) Request, when appropriate, that the agency notify the Office of Science and Technology Policy of its determination.</P>
              <P>(j) If the request requires the rendering of services for which fees may be charged under title 5 of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 31 U.S.C. 483a, the Executive Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, may calculate the anticipated amount of fees to be charged.</P>
              <P>(1) Fees for the location and reproduction of information that is the subject of a mandatory review request shall be assessed according to the following schedule:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Search for records.</E> $5.00 per hour when the search is conducted by a clerical employee; $8.00 per hour when the search is conducted by a professional employee. No fee shall be assessed for searches of less than one hour.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reproduction of documents.</E> Documents will be reproduced at a rate of <PRTPAGE P="547"/>$.25 per page for all copying of four pages or more. No fee shall be assessed for reproducing documents that are three pages or less, or for the first three pages of longer documents.</P>
              <P>(2) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25, and the requestor has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requester shall be promptly notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. In instances where the estimated fees will greatly exceed $25, an advance deposit may be required. Dispatch of such a notice or request shall suspend the running of the period for response by OSTP until a reply is received from the requester.</P>
              <P>(3) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittances shall be made to the Treasury of the United States and mailed to the Executive Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC 20506.</P>

            <P>The regulations in this part prescribe procedures to obtain information and records from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. The regulations in this part apply only to records that are:</P>
            <P>(a) Either created or obtained by OSTP; and</P>
            <P>(b) Under OSTP control at the time of the FOIA request.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 2402.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Delegation of authority and responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy designates the OSTP General Counsel as the Chief FOIA Officer, and hereby delegates to the Chief FOIA Officer the authority to act upon all requests for agency records and to re-delegate such authority at his or her discretion.</P>

            <P>(b) The Chief FOIA Officer shall designate a FOIA Public Liaison, who shall serve as the supervisory official to whom a FOIA requester can raise concerns about the service the FOIA requester has received following an initial response. The FOIA Public Liaison will be listed on the OSTP Web site (<E T="03">http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp</E>) and may re-delegate the FOIA Public Liaison's authority at his or her discretion.</P>

            <P>(c) The Director establishes a FOIA Requester Service Center that shall be staffed by the Chief FOIA Officer and the FOIA Public Liaison. The contact information for the FOIA Requester Service Center is Office of Science and Technology Policy, Eisenhower Executive Office Building, 1650 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20504; Telephone: (202) 456-4444 Fax: (202) 456-6021; Email: <E T="03">ostpfoia@ostp.eop.gov.</E> Updates to this contact information will be made on the OSTP Web site.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General policy and definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Non-exempt records available to public.</E> Except for records exempt from disclosure by 5 U.S.C. 552(b) or published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1), agency records of OSTP subject to FOIA are available to any person who requests them in accordance with these regulations.<PRTPAGE P="553"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Record availability at the OSTP e-FOIA Reading Room.</E> OSTP shall make records available on its Web site in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), as amended, and other documents that, because of the nature of their subject matter, are likely to be the subject of FOIA requests. To save both time and money, OSTP strongly urges requesters to review documents available at the OSTP e-FOIA Reading Room before submitting a request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this part:</P>
            <P>(1) All of the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act, and the definitions included in the “Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines” issued by the Office of Management and Budget apply, unless otherwise defined in this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) The term “commercial use request” means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. OSTP shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because OSTP has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, OSTP shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.</P>
            <P>(3) The terms “disclose” or “disclosure” refer to making records available, upon request, for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records.</P>
            <P>(4) The term “duplication” means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others.</P>
            <P>(5) The term “educational institution” means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(6) The term “fee waiver” means the waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied.</P>
            <P>(7) The term “FOIA Public Liaison” means an agency official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.</P>
            <P>(8) The term “noncommercial scientific institution” means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in these regulations, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.</P>
            <P>(9) The term “perfected request” means a FOIA request for records that adequately describes the records sought, that has been received by OSTP, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment of applicable fees.</P>

            <P>(10) The terms “representative of the news media” or “news media requester” mean any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this clause, the term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if <PRTPAGE P="554"/>such entities qualify as disseminators of ‘news’) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</P>
            <P>(11) The term “search” refers to the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.</P>
            <P>(12) The term “working day” means a regular Federal working day. It does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal Federal holidays.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 2402.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Procedure for requesting records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Format of requests.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Requests for information must be made in writing and may be delivered by mail, fax, or electronic mail, as specified in § 2402.2(c). All requests must be made in English. Requests for information must specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. When requesters do not specify the preferred form or format of the response, OSTP shall produce printed copies of responsive records.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Electronic format records.</E> (i) OSTP shall provide the responsive record or records in the form or format requested if the record or records are readily reproducible by OSTP in that form or format. OSTP shall make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible for the purpose of disclosure. For purposes of this paragraph, the term readily reproducible means, with respect to electronic format, a record or records that can be downloaded or transferred intact to a floppy disk, computer disk (CD), tape, or other electronic medium using equipment currently in use by the office or offices processing the request. Even though some records may initially be readily reproducible, the need to segregate exempt from nonexempt records may cause the releasable material to be not readily reproducible.</P>
            <P>(ii) In responding to a request for records, OSTP shall make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except where such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system(s). For purposes of this paragraph, the term “search” means to locate, manually or by automated means, agency records for the purpose of identifying those records that are responsive to a request.</P>
            <P>(iii) Searches for records maintained in electronic form or format may require the application of codes, queries, or other minor forms of programming to retrieve the requested records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents.</E> A request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OSTP personnel to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. OSTP will regard a request for a specific category of records as fulfilling the requirements of this paragraph if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive to OSTP operations. Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, number, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. If OSTP determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it will either provide notice of any additional information needed or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. OSTP will offer a requester reasonable opportunity to reformulate the request so that it meets the requirements of this section.<PRTPAGE P="555"/>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Date of receipt.</E> A request that complies with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is deemed a “perfected request.” A perfected request is deemed received on the actual date it is received by OSTP. A request that does not comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is deemed received when sufficient information to perfect the request is actually received by OSTP. For requests that are expected to result in fees exceeding $250, the request shall not be deemed to have been received until OSTP has received full payment or satisfactory assurance of full payment as provided under § 2402.8.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 2402.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Responses within 20 working days.</E> OSTP will exercise all reasonable efforts to acknowledge, grant, partially grant, or deny a request for records within 20 working days after receiving a perfected request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Extensions of response time in “unusual circumstances.”</E> In circumstances where a determination as provided in paragraph (a) of this section is not possible within 20 working days, OSTP may extend the time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section as necessary to adequately respond to a request. OSTP shall notify the requester of the extension, the reasons for the extension, and the date on which a determination is expected. In such instances, the requester will be provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the time limit, or to agree to a reasonable alternative time frame for processing. Circumstances justifying a time limit extension as provided in this paragraph (b) include, but are not limited to, requests that require OSTP to:</P>
            <P>(1) Search for and collect the requested records from off-site storage facilities;</P>
            <P>(2) Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request;</P>
            <P>(3) Consult, with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request; or</P>
            <P>(4) Perform searches of records of former employees.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Two-track processing.</E> To ensure the most equitable treatment possible for all requesters, OSTP will process requests on a first-in, first-out basis, using a two-track processing system based upon the estimated time it will take to process the request.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Simple requests.</E> The first track is for requests of simple to moderate complexity that are expected to be completed within 20 working days. A requester whose request does not qualify as a simple request may be given an opportunity to limit the scope of his or her request in order to qualify for faster processing.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Complex requests.</E> The second track is for requests involving “unusual circumstances,” as described in paragraph (b) of this section, that are expected to take more than 20 working days to complete.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) Expedited requests: OSTP may take requests out of order and expedite the processing of a request upon receipt of a written statement that clearly demonstrates a compelling need for expedited processing. Requesters must provide detailed explanations to support their expedited requests. For purposes of determining expedited processing, the term compelling need means:</P>
            <P>(i) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of any individual; or</P>
            <P>(ii) That a request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, and the person establishes that there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</P>
            <P>(2) A person requesting expedited processing must include a statement certifying that the compelling need provided is true to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief.</P>

            <P>(3) OSTP may grant or deny a request for expedited processing as a matter of agency discretion. A determination of whether to provide expedited processing shall be made, and notice of the determination shall be provided to the person making the request, within 10 working days after receipt of the perfected request.<PRTPAGE P="556"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Content of denial.</E> When OSTP denies a request for records, either in whole or in part, the written notice of the denial shall state the reason for denial, and cite the applicable statutory exemption(s), unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s) under which the request was denied, and notify the requester of the right to appeal the determination as specified in § 2402.7. The requester's failure to make advance payment or to give a satisfactory assurance of full payment required under § 2402.8 may be treated as a denial of the request and appealed under § 2402.7.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Identifying responsive records.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, OSTP ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date the component begins its search for them.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals.</E> When OSTP receives a request for a record in its possession, it shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under FOIA and, if so, whether it should be disclosed as a matter of administrative discretion. If the receiving component determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the receiving component determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it shall either:</P>
            <P>(1) Respond to the request regarding that record after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it, or to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it. OSTP shall notify the FOIA requester in writing that a referral of records has been made, provide the name of the agency to which the referral was directed, and include that agency's FOIA contact information.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Redactions.</E> For redactions within disclosed records, OSTP shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Indicate the FOIA exemption under which a redaction is made, unless including that exemption would harm an interest protected by the exemption; and</P>
            <P>(2) Indicate, if technically feasible and reasonable, the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made at the place in the record where the deletion is made.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 2402.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Business information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Business information obtained by OSTP from a submitter will be disclosed under FOIA only under this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Business information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by OSTP from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of FOIA.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity from whom OSTP obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of business information.</E> A submitter of business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> OSTP shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its business information, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information. The notice shall either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, notification may <PRTPAGE P="557"/>be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Where notice is required.</E> Notice shall be given to a submitter wherever:</P>
            <P>(1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
            <P>(2) OSTP has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> OSTP will allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section and will specify that time period within the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, the submitter is required to provide a detailed written statement of objections. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, the submitter must show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that OSTP does not receive within the time specified shall not be considered by OSTP. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> OSTP shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever OSTP decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, OSTP shall give the submitter written notice, which shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</P>
            <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section shall not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) OSTP determines that the information should not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 235); or</P>
            <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous—except that, in such a case, OSTP shall, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, OSTP shall promptly notify the submitter.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Corresponding notice to requesters.</E> Whenever OSTP provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, OSTP shall also notify the requester(s). Whenever OSTP notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose requested information under paragraph (g) of this section, OSTP shall also notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, OSTP shall notify the requester(s).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeal of denials.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A denial of a request for records, either in whole or in part, may be appealed in writing to the Chief FOIA Officer within 30 working days of the date of the letter denying an initial request.</P>

            <P>(b) Appeals may be sent via email to ostpfoia@ostp.eop.gov or by mail to: Chief FOIA Officer, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Eisenhower Executive Office Building, 1650 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20504. Updates to this contact information will be made on the OSTP Web site. The appeal letter should specify the internal control number assigned to the FOIA request by OSTP in its response, <PRTPAGE P="558"/>the records requested, and the basis for the appeal.</P>
            <P>(c) The Chief FOIA Officer shall make a determination on the appeal under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii) within 20 working days after the receipt of the appeal. If the denial is wholly or partially upheld, the Chief FOIA Officer shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Notify the requester that judicial review is available pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B)-(G); and</P>

            <P>(2) Notify the requester that the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. OGIS' contact information is: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, MD 20740, Email: <E T="03">ogis@nara.gov,</E> Telephone: 202-741-5770, Facsimile: 202-741-5769, Toll-free: 1-877-684-6448.</P>
            <P>(d) If OGIS' services are requested, OSTP will work with OGIS and the FOIA requester to resolve any dispute as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees generally required.</E> OSTP shall use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under FOIA. OSTP shall charge fees in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section unless fees are waived in accordance with § 2402.9.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Calculation of fees.</E> In general, fees for searching, reviewing, and duplication will be based on the direct costs of these services, including the average hourly salary (base plus locality payment plus 16 percent) for the employee(s) making the search.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search fee.</E> Search fees may be charged even if responsive documents are not located or if they are located but withheld on the basis of an exemption. However, search fees shall be limited or not charged as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Easily identifiable records.</E> Search fees shall not be charged for records that are identified by the requester by title of the record and name of the person possessing the record</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational, scientific or news media requests.</E> No search fee shall be charged if the request is not sought for a commercial use and is made by an educational or scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, or by a representative of the news media.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Other non-commercial requests.</E> No search fee shall be charged for the first two hours of searching if the request is not for a commercial use but is not by an educational or scientific institution, or a representative of the news media.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Requests for records about self.</E> No search fee shall be charged to search for records performed under the terms of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Review fee.</E> A review fee shall be charged only for commercial requests. A review fee shall be charged for the initial examination of documents located in response to a request to determine the documents may be withheld from disclosure and for the redaction of document portions exempt from disclosure. Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review are also assessable.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication fee.</E> Records will be photocopied at a rate of $0.10 per page. For other methods of reproduction or duplication, OSTP will charge the actual direct costs of producing the document(s). Duplication fees shall not be charged for the first 100 pages of copies unless the copies are requested for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Aggregation of requests.</E> When OSTP determines that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to evade the assessment of fees by submitting multiple requests in the place of a single more complex request, OSTP may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees likely to exceed $25.</E> If the total fee charges are likely to exceed $25, OSTP shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of the charges. The estimate shall include a breakdown of the fees for search, review, and/or duplication. The notification <PRTPAGE P="559"/>shall offer the requester an opportunity to confer with the FOIA Public Liaison to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> Advance payment of fees will generally not be required. If, however, charges are likely to exceed $250, OSTP shall notify the requester of the likely cost and:</P>
            <P>(1) Obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment; or</P>
            <P>(2) Regardless of when a FOIA request becomes perfected under § 2402.4(c), if the requester has no history of payment or has failed to pay a fee within 30 days of the date of billing, OSTP may require the requester to pay the full amount of any fees owed and/or to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated charges before OSTP begins to process the new request or a pending request from that requester. In this case, OSTP's working days to process the request as described in § 2402.5 will not begin to run until the date OSTP receives the full amount of any fees owed and/or the advance payment of the full amount of the estimated charges.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> OSTP will recover the full costs of providing services such as those enumerated below when it elects to provide them:</P>
            <P>(1) Certifying that records are true copies;</P>
            <P>(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Remittances.</E> Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the Treasury of the United States and mailed to the Chief FOIA Officer, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Eisenhower Executive Office Building, 1650 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20504. Updates to this contact information will be made on the OSTP Web site.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Receipts and refunds.</E> A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request. A refund of fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 2402.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Waiver of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> OSTP shall waive part or all of the fees assessed under § 2402.8 if the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
            <P>(1) Disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and</P>
            <P>(2) Disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Clarification.</E> Where OSTP has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, OSTP may seek clarification from the requester before assigning the request to a specific category for fee assessment purposes.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Partial waiver of fees.</E> If the two conditions stated in paragraph (a) of this section are met, OSTP will ordinarily waive all fees. In exceptional cases and provided that the requester does not meet the conditions stated in paragraph (a), however, a partial waiver may be granted if the request for records would impose an exceptional burden on OSTP or require an exceptional expenditure of OSTP resources.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to comply.</E> OSTP will not assess fees under § 2402.8 if the Agency fails to comply with any time limit and no exceptional circumstances apply to processing the request.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Waivers.</E> OSTP may waive fees in other circumstances solely at its discretion, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552 and the Fee Waiver Policy Guidance issued by the Department of Justice.</P>

            <P>(b) OSTP shall annually, on or before February 1 of each year, prepare and submit to the Attorney General an annual report compiling the statistics maintained in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section for the previous fiscal year. A copy of the report will be available for public inspection at the OSTP Web site.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure, consistent with the authorities listed in § 2700.1, that national security information originated and/or held by the Office for Micronesian Status Negotiations (OMSN), which includes the Status Liaison Office, Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands (SLNO), is protected. To ensure that such information is protected, but only to the extent and for such period as is necessary, this regulation identifies the information to be protected and prescribes certain classification, declassification and safeguarding procedures to be followed.</P>

              <P>This Regulation supplements E.O. 12065 within OMSN with regard to National Security Information. In consonance with the authorities listed in § 2700.1, it establishes general policies and certain procedures for the classification, declassification and safeguarding of information which is owned by, is produced for or by, or is under the control of OMSN.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basic policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> It is the policy of OMSN to make available to the public as much information concerning its activities as is possible, consistent with its responsibility to protect the national security.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Safeguarding national security information.</E> Within the Federal Government there is some information which because it bears directly on the effectiveness of our national defense and the conduct of our foreign relations, must be subject to some constraints for the security of our nation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Balancing test.</E> To balance the public's interest in access to government information with the need to protect certain national security information from disclosure, these regulations indentify the information to be protected, prescribe classification, downgrading, declassification, and safeguarding procedures to be followed, and establish education, monitoring and <PRTPAGE P="564"/>sanctioning systems to insure their effectiveness. When questions arise as whether the need to protect information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, they shall be referred to OMSN pursuant to § 2700.32(b) for a determination whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 2700.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Criteria for and level of original classification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General Policy.</E> Documents or other material are to be classified only when protecting the national security requires that the information they contain be withheld from public disclosure. Information may not be classified to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error, or to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization or agency, or to restrain competition. No material may be classified to limit dissemination, or to prevent or delay public release, unless its classification is consistent with E.O. 12065.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> To be eligible for classification, information must meet two requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) First, it must deal with one of the criteria set forth in section 1-301 of E.O. 12065;</P>
              <P>(2) Second, the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations or his delegate who has original classification authority must determine that unauthorized disclosure of the information or material can reasonably be expected to cause at least identifiable harm to the national security.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Classification designations.</E> Only three designations of classification are authorized—“Top Secret,” “Secret,” “Confidential.” No other classification designation is authorized or shall have force.</P>
              <P>(d) Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher than is necessary, shall be avoided. If there is reasonable doubt as to which designation in section 1-1 of E.O. 12065 is appropriate, or whether information should be classified at all, the less restrictive designation should be used, or the information should not be classified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duration of original classification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Information or material which is classified after December 1, 1978, shall be marked at the time of classification with the date or event for declassification or a date for review for declassification. This date or event shall be as early as national security permits and shall be no more than six years after original classification except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Only the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations may authorize a classification period exceeding six years. Originally classified information that is so designated shall be identified with the authority and reason for extension. This authority shall be used sparingly. In those cases where extension of classification is warranted, a declassification date or event, or a date for review shall be set. This date or event shall be early as national security permits and shall be no more than twenty years after original classification except that for foreign information the date or event may be up to thirty years after original classification.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Challenges to classification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>If holders of classified information believe the information is improperly or unnecessarily classified, or that original classification has been extended for too long a period, they should discuss the matter with their immediate superiors or the classifier of the information. If these discussions do not satisfy the concerns of the challenger, the matter should be brough to the attention of the chairman of the OMSN Information Security Oversight Committee, established pursuant to § 2700.51. Action on such challenges shall be taken within 30 days from date of receipt and the challenger shall be notified of the results. When requested, anonymity of the challenger shall be preserved.</P>

              <P>Derivative classification is the act of assigning a level of classification to information which is determined to be the same in substance as information which is currently classified.

              <P>OMSN shall issue classification guides pursuant to section 2-2 of E.O. 12065. These guides, which shall be used to direct derivative classification, shall identify the information to be protected in specific and uniform terms so that the information involved can be readily identified. The classification guides shall be approved in writing by the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations. Such approval constitutes an original classification decision. The classification guides shall be kept current and shall be reviewed at least every two years.</P>

              <P>Declassification of classified information shall be given emphasis comparable to that accorded to classification. The determination to declassify information shall not be made on the basis of the level of classification assigned, but on the loss of the sensitivity of the information with the passage of time, and with due regard for the public interest in access to official information. At the time of review, any determination not to declassify shall be based on a determination that despite the passage of time since classification, release of information reasonably could still be expected to cause at least identifiable damage to the national security.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mandatory review for declassification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> All information classified under the Order or prior orders, except as provided for in section 3-503 of E.O. 12065 shall be subject to review for declassification upon request of a member of the public, a government employee, or an agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Receipt.</E> (1) Requests for mandatory review for declassification under section 3-501 of E.O. 12065 must be in writing and should be addressed to: Office for Micronesian Status Negotiations, ATTN: Security Officer (Mandatory Review Request), Room 3356, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.</P>
              <P>(2) The requestor shall be informed of the date of receipt of the request at OMSN. This date will be the basis for the time limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If the request does not reasonably describe the information sought, the requestor shall be notified that, unless additional information is provided or the request is made more specific, no further action will be taken.</P>
              <P>(4) Subject to paragraph (b)(7) of this section, if the information requested is in the custody of and under the exclusive declassification authority of OMSN, OMSN shall determine whether the information or any reasonably segregable portion of it no longer requires protection. If so, OMSN shall promptly make such information available to the requester, unless withholding it is otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be released, in whole or in part, OMSN shall give the requester a brief statement of the reasons, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the agency review committee, and notice that such an appeal must be filed with the review committee within 60 days.</P>

              <P>(5) When OMSN receives a request for information in a document which is in its custody, but which was classified by <PRTPAGE P="566"/>another agency, it shall refer the request to the appropriate agency for review, together with a copy of the document containing the information requested, where practicable. OMSN shall also notify the requester of the referral, unless the association of the reviewing agency with the information requires protection. The reviewing agency shall review a document in coordination with any other agency involved with the classification or having a direct interest in the subject matter. The reviewing agency shall respond directly to the requester in accordance with the pertinent procedures described above and, if requested, shall notify OMSN of its determination.</P>

              <P>(6) Requests for declassification of classified documents originated by OMSN or another agency but in the possession and control of the Administrator of General Services, pursuant to 44 U.S.C 2107 or 2107 <E T="03">Note,</E> shall be referred by the Archivist to the agency of origin for processing and for direct response to the requests. The Archivist will inform requesters of such referrals.</P>
              <P>(7) In the case of requests for documents containing foreign government information, OMSN, if it is also the agency which initially received the foreign government information, shall determine whether the foreign government information in the document may be declassified and released in accordance with agency policies or guidelines, consulting with other agencies of subject matter interest as necessary. If OMSN is not the agency which received the foreign government information, it shall refer the request to the latter agency, which shall take action on the request. In those cases where available agency policies or guidelines do not apply, consultation with the foreign originator through appropriate channels may be advisable prior to final action on the request.</P>
              <P>(8) If any agency makes a request on behalf of a member of the public, the request shall be considered as a request by that member of the public and handled accordingly.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review.</E> (1) Within sixty days from its receipt, OMSN shall inform the requestor of the determination of the mandatory review for declassification.</P>
              <P>(2) If the determination is to withhold some or all of the material requested, the requestor may appeal the determination. The requestor shall be informed that an appeal must be made in writing within sixty days of receipt of the denial and should be addressed to the chairperson of the OMSN Classification Review Committee established pursuant to § 2700.52.</P>
              <P>(3) No agency in possession of a classified document may, in response to a request for the document made under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or under section 3-5 of E.O. 12065, refuse to confirm the existence or non-existence of the document, unless the fact of its existence or non-existence would itself be classifiable.</P>
              <P>(4) The requestor shall be informed of the appellate determination within thirty days of receipt of the appeal.</P>
              <P>(5) In considering requests for mandatory review, OMSN may decline to review again any request for material which has been recently reviewed and denied, except insofar as the request constitutes an appeal under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Processing of Requests.</E> The processing of requests by OMSN shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The Security Officer or his designee shall record the request, and arrange for search and review of the documents. The documents will be reviewed for declassification in accordance with these regulations or any applicable guidelines. If the documents remain classified and are not to be released, in whole or in part, the reviewing office will also prepare a letter informing the requester as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The letter to the requester shall be signed by the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations, his Deputy or the Status Liaison Officer. The Security Officer or his designee shall record disposition of the case and forward the letter of denial to the requester.</P>
              <P>(2) If any request requires obtaining the views of other agencies, the receiving office shall arrange coordination of review with such other agencies.</P>

              <P>(3) When all documents involved in the request are declassified and released, the receiving office will send a <PRTPAGE P="567"/>release statement, to the requester, and shall inform the requester of any fees due before releasing documents.</P>
              <P>(4) In the case of documents of agency origin requested by a Presidential Library on behalf of a member of the public, if there is a partial denial, the letter will advise the requester as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, but the requester will be referred to the Archivist for copies of the released document, with portions excised. The receiving office will transmit such documents, with portions marked to be excised, to Archives which will transmit them with portions excised to the Presidential Library for its records and for use in the case of further similar requests.</P>
              <P>(5) The Security Officer or his designee shall also coordinate requests from other agencies seeking the views of OMSN as to declassification of documents originated by such other agencies but involving information of primary subject matter interest to OMSN. The Security Officer or his designee will transmit the documents to the reviewing individual for a determination as to declassification and will coordinate the reply of OMSN to the requesting agency.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> (1) The President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations shall receive appeals for denial of documents by OMSN. Such appeals shall be addressed to President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations, Suite 3356, Interior Department Building, Washington, DC 20240. The appeal must be received in OMSN within 60 days of the date of the original denial letter or the final release of documents, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(2) Appeals shall be decided within 30 days of their receipt.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Fees.</E> (1) Fees for the location and reproduction of information which is the subject of a mandatory review request shall be assessed according to the following schedule:</P>
              <P>(i) Search for records: $5.00 per hour when the search is conducted by a clerical employee; $8.00 per hour when the search is conducted by a professional employee. No fee shall be assessed for searches of less than one hour.</P>
              <P>(ii) Reproduction of documents: Documents will be reproduced at a rate of $.25 per page for all copying of four pages or more. No fee shall be assessed for reproducing documents which are three pages or less, or for the first three pages of longer documents.</P>
              <P>(2) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25.00, and the requestor has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requestor shall be promptly notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. In instances where the estimated fees will greatly exceed $25.00, an advance deposit may be required. Dispatch of such a notice or request shall suspend the running of the period for response by OMSN until a reply is received from the requestor.</P>
              <P>(3) Remittance shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittance shall be made payable to Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the address noted in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) A receipt for fees paid will be provided only upon request. Refund of fees for services actually rendered will not be made.</P>
              <P>(5) OMSN may waive all or part of any fee provided for in this section when it is deemed to be in either the interest of OMSN or of the general public.</P>

All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the names of such designees and updated information as necessary. In the event that the Top Secret Control Officer or his designees are not available to receive such documents, they shall be turned over to the office supervisor and secured, unopened, in a designated combination safe located in OMSN or SLNO, as appropriate until the Top Secret Control Officer is available. All materials not immediately deliverable to the Top Secret Control Officer shall be delivered at the earliest opportunity. Under no circumstances shall classified material that cannot be delivered to the Top Secret Control Officer be stored other than in the designated safe.</P>

            <P>The classification, declassification, safeguarding and handling of classified information within the Office of the Vice President will comply with the letter and spirit of those directives listed in § 2800.2. All personnel of the Office of the Vice President are responsible individually for complying with the provisions of these regulations are in all respects. The provisions of these regulations applicable to all personnel assigned or detailed to the Office of the Vice President.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 2800.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Staff Security Officer/Top Secret Control Officer.</E> A Vice Presidential Staff Security Officer and Assistant Staff Security Officer will be assigned to perform the duties as outlined in these regulations. They will normally be on the staff of the Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs. The Staff Security Officer and Assistant Staff Security Officer will serve as Top Secret Control Officer and Assistant Top Secret Control Officer and custodians of classified material for the Office of the Vice President respectively, and will be responsible for the overall supervision of the Top Secret Control program. They will maintain positive control over the movement of all Top Secret material under their jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Custodian, Office of the Assistant to the Vice President for Congressional Relations.</E> The Assistant to the Vice President for Congressional Relations, Office of the President of the Senate, will be designated as Custodian of classified material for that office. He will be responsible for compliance with the instructions contained herein. In this capacity, he will be charged with safeguarding classified material necessary to the operation of the office.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">National Security Classifications.</E> Classifications of National Security Information are defined in Executive Order 12065, sections 1-102 through 1-104.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Prohibited Markings.</E> (1) The caveats “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” and “ADMINISTRATIVELY RESTRICTED” are used within the Office of the Vice President to designate certain unclassified information which requires control. These caveats will under no circumstances be applied to information which qualifies as classified information. Further, neither they nor other terms will be used in conjunction with the prescribed security classifications of CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET.</P>
            <P>(2) Unclassified information bearing either of the foregoing administrative designations cannot be protected from release under the national security exemption of the Freedom of Information Act (although other exemptions may be available).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Security Clearances.</E> No person shall be given access to classified information or material unless a favorable background investigation has been <PRTPAGE P="574"/>completed determining that the individual is trustworthy and that access is necessary for the performance of official duties.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Security Clearance Procedures.</E> (i) The Counsel to the Vice President will:</P>
            <P>(A) Be responsible for the processing of full field investigations for personnel assigned to the Vice President's staff. Department of Defense detailees are processed by the Defense Investigative Service.</P>
            <P>(B) Inform the Staff Security Office of individuals whose full field investigations have been satisfactorily completed and approved and of any subsequent changes.</P>
            <P>(C) Notify the Staff Security Office as soon as he/she is aware that a staff member is planning to terminate his/her employment.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Staff Security Office will provide newly cleared persons with a security orientation briefing covering policy and procedures for handling classified information and material. After the briefing individuals will sign a Statement of Understanding of Security Procedures (Attachment 1). This statement will be kept on file by the Staff Security Office.</P>

            <P>(iii) There is no such thing as an “Interim Security Clearance” for persons employed by or detailed to the Office of the Vice President. Under <E T="03">no</E> circumstances will uncleared persons be given access to classified material. Access to classified material will be denied until the individual has had a satisfactorily completed background investigation, has received the security orientation briefing and signed the Statement of Understanding of Security Procedures.</P>
            <P>(iv) The Staff Security Office, as part of an individual's departure debriefing, will remind them of their continuing responsibilities to protect classified information to which they have had access during the performance of their official duties. After being debriefed, the individual will sign a Security Termination Statement acknowledging his responsibilities (Attachment 2).</P>
            <P>(2) Satisfactory completion of a background investigation does not in itself grant an individual access to classified information. Individual clearances for access to classified information or material will be controlled by the Staff Security Office and certified in writing on an individual basis.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Access to Classified Material.</E> Each member of the staff who has custody or possession of classified information is responsible for providing the required degree of protection from unauthorized disclosure at all times.</P>
            <P>(1) Classified information and material will only be disclosed to an individual after it has been determined that the individual possesses the required clearance and has a valid “need to know.” Persons releasing the information shall be responsible in every case for determining the recipient's eligibility for access.</P>
            <P>(2) Access to Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Information will be controlled by the Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Custody and safekeeping of Classified Material.</E> (1) Classified material addressed to the Office of the Vice President will normally be delivered to and receipted for by the Staff Security Office where it will be entered into the classified material control system.</P>
            <P>(i) Staff members receiving classified material from any source by any means will personally deliver such material to the Staff Security Office for appropriate entry into the classified control system.</P>
            <P>(ii) Conversely, members of the staff desiring to transmit classified material will deliver the material to the Staff Security Office for handling in accordance with paragraph (h)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Storage of Classified Material.</E> (i) Classified material will be stored only in accordance with the provisions of ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraph IV-F-1 through 4.</P>

            <P>(ii) Filing of unclassified material in security containers is prohibited except where the unclassified material is an integral part of a file which contains classified material. If extenuating circumstances necessitate the use of a security container for storing only unclassified material, the container will be marked with a sign stating “This container is not used to store <PRTPAGE P="575"/>classified material” or “Do not store classified material in this container.”</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Record of safe locations.</E> The Staff Security Office will assign numbers to all security containers used to store classified material in the Office of the Vice President. A record of safe numbers, locations and date of last combination change will be maintained in the Staff Security Office.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Changing of lock combinations.</E> Combinations of security containers will be changed by the Staff Security Office or the Secret Service. This service may be requested by contacting the Staff Security Office. Combinations will be changed in accordance with the provisions of ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraph IV-F-5.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Records of combinations.</E> Records of combinations shall be maintained by the Staff Security Office. Whenever a combination is changed, the new combination and other required information will be recorded on GSA Optional Form 63. The sealed envelope will then be delivered to the Staff Security Office for retention in the vault safe.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Custodians.</E> Each container used for storage of classified material within the Office of the Vice President will have assigned a primary and alternate custodian. Responsibility for security of these containers shall rest with those persons, and their names shall be affixed on the outside of the top drawer of each container positioned so as to be readily discernible. Optional Form 63 shall be used for this purpose.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Handling of Classified Material</E>—(1) <E T="03">Use of cover sheets.</E> A separate cover sheet indicating the classification of the material will be fastened to the top page of cover of each CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET document.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Unattended documents.</E> Classified material will be under the direct supervision of a person with an appropriate security clearance and a verified need-to-know at all times when in use. Special care will be taken to insure that classified material is not left unsecured or unattended in an office.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Working papers.</E> Working papers are documents, including drafts, photographs, etc., created to assist in the formulation and preparation of finished papers. Working papers containing classified information will be marked with the appropriate classification and provided the same degree of protection as that given to other documents of an equal category of classification.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Communications security.</E> Classified information shall not be discussed over any voice communications device except as authorized over <E T="03">approved</E> secure communications circuits. This restriction also applies to electrical transmission of classified material via any unsecure circuitry involving teletypes, DEX equipment or other systems of a like nature. Appropriate secure facilities for the discussion or transmittal of classified material may be arranged by contacting the Staff Security Office.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Transmittal of Classified Material</E>—(i) <E T="03">Outside the Office of the Vice President and the White House Complex.</E> The Staff Security Office is responsible for transmitting or transferring all classified material outside the Office of the Vice President and the White House Complex in accordance with the provisions of ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraphs I, G and H.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Within the Office of the Vice President and the White House Complex.</E> Transfer or movement of classified material will be accomplished only by properly cleared persons handcarrying the material to the recipient. The material shall be carried in an envelope marked with the appropriate classification. <E T="03">Use of see through messenger envelopes is not authorized.</E> Recipients will sign a receipt (GSA Optional Form 112) for all material classified SECRET and TOP SECRET. Whenever TOP SECRET material is transferred, the Staff Security Office will be notified in order to maintain accurate accountability of the material. Classified material will never be delivered to an uncleared person, left in an unoccupied office, or sent through unclassified mail delivery/distribution systems.</P>

            <P>(iii) Staff members requiring the use of classified material at conferences or meetings held outside the Washington, DC Metropolitan area and who intend to use commercial transportation shall provide the material to the Staff Security Office far enough in advance to assure that the material will be available <PRTPAGE P="576"/>on or before the date needed. This requirement does not apply when utilizing government/military transportation. In this case, material may be handcarried. The Staff Security Office will brief each staff member prior to departure concerning security requirements or arrangements needed to safeguard the material while away from his office. For meetings or conferences within the Washington, DC Metropolitan area, members may handcarry classified material. Use of classified material during a conference or meeting requires increased awareness and precautionary handling to avoid security violations and/or compromises. Staff members using classified material during a meeting or conference are responsible for ensuring that the material is properly protected at all times, and that personnel present posses appropriate clearances for the material being presented.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Visits to foreign countries.</E> Special precautions must be taken when visiting foreign countries to ensure classified material is protected at all times. For all visits to foreign countries a member of the staff will be appointed as custodian for all classified material required for the success of the mission. This individual will be the holder of a diplomatic passport which exempts him from customs inspections. Individual so designated will coordinate with United States embassy personnel in the country to be visited for securing of classified material within the embassy compound or other appropriate secure area during the course of the visit.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Preparation and marking of Classified Material.</E> All classified material originating within the office of the Vice President will be prepared and marked by properly authorized and cleared personnel in accordance with ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraphs I, G, and H. A sample letter is attached for your guidance (Attachment 3). Derivitive information will be prepared and classified in accordance with ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraphs II A through C. Questions concerning procedures should be directed to the Staff Security Office.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Reproduction of Classified Material.</E> (i) Reproduction of classified material will be accomplished only by properly cleared persons.</P>
            <P>(ii) Reproduction of TOP SECRET material will be accomplished only by a member of the Staff Security Office or a designated representative of that office.</P>
            <P>(iii) Accountability of reproduced classified material will be maintained by informing the Staff Security Office of the reproduction of SECRET and TOP SECRET material, the number of copies reproduced and their disposition.</P>

            <P>(iv) Reproduction machines can retain the imagery of material passed through them. Therefore, to avoid inadvertent disclosure of classified information through subsequent use of machines, staff members will <E T="03">always</E> run machines through four cycles (four blank pages) after the last page of the classified material has been reproduced. These pages will be destroyed in the same manner as classified material.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Destruction of Classified Material.</E> (i) SECRET and TOP SECRET material will be given to the Staff Security Office for destruction to insure destruction is properly recorded and destroyed material is removed from the classified control system.</P>
            <P>(ii) CONFIDENTIAL material may be destroyed in the holder's office by tearing lengthwise and placing in a “Burn Bag” specifically designated for classified material.</P>
            <P>(iii) Classified waste material will be separated from other office waste material and placed in “Burn Bags.” Classified waste material includes working papers, notes, drafts of classified correspondence, carbon paper, typewriter ribbons and any other material containing information requiring destruction. “Burn Bags” will be collected daily by a member of the White House Executive Protective Service who will then dispose of the bags in a secure facility.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Typewriter ribbons.</E> Classified material can be reproduced from imprints on used typewriter ribbons. Therefore, ribbons which are used in the preparation of classified material must be safeguarded accordingly, i.e., they will <PRTPAGE P="577"/>be stored in a safe at the close of business, destroyed as classified waste when no longer serviceable, etc.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Inventories.</E> The Staff Security Office will conduct inventories of all TOP SECRET material charged to the Office of the Vice President at least annually to determine the adequacy of control procedures and insure accountability.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Loss or compromise.</E> Any person who has knowledge of loss of possible compromise of classified information shall promptly report the circumstances to the Staff Security Office for appropriate action in accordance with ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraph IV, H.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Penalties.</E> Any individual breach of security may warrant penalties up to and including the separation of the individual from his employment or criminal prosecution.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Special access.</E> Special access authority is required for release of Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Information. The names of personnel cleared for access to this category of information are on file in the Staff Security Office.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic policy.</E> Except as provided in the Atomic Energy Act of 1943, as amended, Executive Order 12065, as implemented by ISOO Directive No. 1, provides the only basis for classifying information. It is the policy of this office to make available to the public as much information concerning its activities as possible consistent with the need to protect the national security. Accordingly, security classification shall be applied only to protect the national security.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duration of classification.</E> Classification shall not be continued longer than necessary for the protection of national security. Each decision to classify requires a simultaneous determination of the duration such classification must remain in effect. For further guidance, refer to sections 1-401 and 1-402, E.O. 12065.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Declassification.</E> Declassification of information shall be given emphasis comparable to that accorded to classification. Decisions concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of the information's sensitivity with the passage of time or upon the occurrence of a declassification event. For further guidance, refer to sections 3-102, 3-103 and 3-104 of E.O. 12065.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Systematic review for declassification.</E> Systematic review for declassification will be in accordance with sections 3-204, 3-401 and 3-503 of E.O. 12065.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Mandatory review requests.</E> Requests from a member of the public, a government employee, or an agency, to declassify and release information will be acted upon within 60 days provided the request reasonably identifies the information. After review, the information or any reasonably segregable portion thereof that no longer requires protection, shall be declassified and released, except as provided in section 3-503, E.O. 12065, unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Classification guides.</E> The Chief Counsel, National Security Council, has determined that, in view of the limited amount of material originally classified by this office, the preparation and publication of classification guides is not required.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Access to Classified Information by historical researchers and former Presidential appointees.</E> Access may be granted under the provisions of section 4-3 of E.O. 12065; however, access is permissive and not mandatory.</P>
