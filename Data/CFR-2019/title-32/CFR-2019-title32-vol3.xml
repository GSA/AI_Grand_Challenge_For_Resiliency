      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Voluntary information.</E> Nothing in this part will preclude any financial institution, or any officer, employee, or agent of a financial institution, from notifying an Army investigative element that such institution, or officer, employee or agent has information which may be relevant to a possible violation of any statute or regulation.</P>

              <P>(iv) Type of account of any customer or ascertainable group of customers associated with a financial transaction or class of financial transactions.</P>

However, if access to the financial records themselves is required, the procedures in § 504.2 must be followed. (A sample format for requesting basic identifying account data is in app. A.)</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A law enforcement official seeking access to a person's financial records will, when feasible, obtain the customer's consent. This section also sets forth other authorized procedures for obtaining financial records if it is not feasible to obtain the customer's consent. Authorized procedures for obtaining financial records follow. All communications with a U.S. Attorney or a U.S. District Court, as required by this part, will be coordinated with the supporting staff judge advocate before dispatch.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Customer consent.</E> (1) A law enforcement office may gain access to or a copy of a customer's financial records by obtaining the customer's consent and authorization in writing. (See app. B to this part for a sample format.) Any consent obtained under the provisions of this paragraph must—</P>
              <P>(i) Be in writing, signed, and dated.</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify the particular financial records being disclosed.</P>

              <P>(3) A copy of the customer's consent will be made a part of the law enforcement inquiry file.</P>

              <P>(4) A certification of compliance with 12 U.S.C. 3401 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (app. C), along with the customer's consent, will be provided to the financial institution as a prerequisite to obtaining access to the financial records.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative summons or subpoena.</E> The Army has no authority to issue an administrative summons or subpoena for access to financial records.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Search warrant.</E> (1) A law enforcement office may obtain financial records by using a search warrant obtained under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in appropriate cases.</P>
              <P>(2) No later than 90 days after the search warrant is served, unless a delay of notice is obtained under § 504.2(i), a copy of the search warrant and the following notice must be mailed to the customer's last known address:</P>
              <P>Records or information concerning your transactions held by the financial institution named in the attached search warrant were obtained by this (office/agency/unit) on (date) for the following purpose: (state purpose). You may have rights under the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978.</P>
              <P>(3) Search authorization signed by installation commanders or military judges will not be used to gain access to financial records from financial institutions in any State or territory of the United States.</P>
              <P>(4) Access to financial records maintained by military banking contractors in overseas areas or by other financial institutions located on DOD installations outside the United States, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands is preferably obtained by customer consent.</P>
              <P>(i) In cases where it would not be appropriate to obtain this consent or such consent is refused and the financial institution is not otherwise willing to provide access to its records, the law enforcement activity may seek access by use of a search authorization. This authorization must be prepared and issued per AR 27-10, Military Justice.</P>
              <P>(ii) Information obtained under this paragraph should be properly identified as financial information. It should be transferred only where an official need-to-know exists. Failure to do so, however, does not render the information inadmissible in courts-martial or other proceedings.</P>

              <P>(iii) Law enforcement activities seeking access to financial records maintained by all other financial institutions overseas will comply with local foreign statutes or procedures governing such access.<PRTPAGE P="10"/>

              <P>(2) Include subpoenas issued under Rule for Courts-Martial 703(e)(2) of the Manual for Courts-Martial and Article 46 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The servicing staff judge advocate will be consulted on the availability and use of judicial subpoenas.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Formal written request.</E> (1) A law enforcement office may formally request financial records when the records are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. This request may be issued only if—</P>
              <P>(i) The customer has declined to consent to the disclosure of his or her records, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Seeking consent from the customer would compromise or harmfully delay a legitimate law enforcement inquiry.</P>
              <P>(2) A formal written request will be in a format set forth in appendix D of this part and will—</P>
              <P>(i) State that the request is issued under the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 and this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) Described the specific records to be examined.</P>
              <P>(iii) State that access is sought in connection with a legitimate law enforcement inquiry.</P>
              <P>(iv) Describe the nature of the inquiry.</P>
              <P>(v) Be signed by the head of the law enforcement office or a designee (persons specified in § 504.1(e)(2)).</P>
              <P>(3) At the same time or before a formal written request is issued to a financial institution, a copy of the request will be personally served upon or mailed to the customer's last known address unless a delay of customer notice has been obtained under § 504.2(i). The notice to the customer will be—</P>
              <P>(i) In a format similar to appendix E of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) Personally served at least 10 days or mailed at least 14 days before the date on which access is sought.</P>
              <P>(4) The official who signs the customer notice is designated to receive any challenge from the customer.</P>
              <P>(5) The customer will have 10 days to challenge a notice request when personal service is made, and 14 days when service is by mail.</P>
              <P>(6) The head of the law enforcement office initiating the formal written request will set up procedures to ensure that no access to financial records is attempted before expiration of the above time periods—</P>
              <P>(i) While awaiting receipt of a potential customer challenge, or</P>
              <P>(ii) While awaiting the filing of an application for an injunction by the customer.</P>
              <P>(7) Proper preparation of the formal written request and notice to the customer requires preparation of motion papers and a statement suitable for court filing by the customer. Accordingly, the law enforcement office intending to initiate a formal written request will coordinate preparation of the request, the notice, motion papers, and sworn statement with the supporting staff judge advocate. These documents are required by statute; their preparation cannot be waived.</P>
              <P>(8) The supporting staff judge advocate is responsible for liaison with the proper United States Attorney and United States District Court. The requesting official will coordinate with the supporting staff judge advocate to determine whether the customer has filed a motion to prevent disclosure of the financial records within the prescribed time limits.</P>

              <P>(9) The head of the law enforcement office (§ 504.2(f)(2)(v)) will certify in writing (see app. C) to the financial institution that such office has complied with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 3401 <E T="03">et seq.</E>—</P>
              <P>(i) When a customer fails to file a challenge to access to financial records within the above time periods, or</P>
              <P>(ii) When a challenge is adjudicated in favor of the law enforcement office. No access to any financial records will be made before such certification is given.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Emergency access.</E> Section 504.2(g)(2)(3) provides for emergency access in such cases of imminent danger. (No other procedures in this part apply to such emergency access.)</P>

              <P>(1) In some cases, the requesting law enforcement office may determine that a delay in obtaining access would create an imminent danger of—<PRTPAGE P="11"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Physical injury to a person,</P>
              <P>(ii) Serious property damage, or</P>
              <P>(iii) Flight to avoid prosecution.</P>
              <P>(2) When emergency access is made to financial records, the requesting official (§ 504.1(e)(2)) will—</P>

              <P>(ii) File with the proper court a signed, sworn statement setting forth the grounds for the emergency access within 5 days of obtaining access to financial records.</P>
              <P>(3) After filing of the signed, sworn statement, the official who has obtained access to financial records under this paragraph will as soon as practicable—</P>

              <P>(i) Personally serve or mail to the customer a copy of the request to the financial institution and the following notice, unless a delay of notice has been obtained under § 504.2(i):

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Records transfer.</E> (i) Financial records originally obtained under this part will not be transferred to another agency or department outside the DOD unless the transferring law enforcement office certifies their relevance in writing. Certification will state that there is reason to believe that the records are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry within the jurisdiction of the receiving agency or department. To support this certification, the transferring office may require that the requesting agency submit adequate justification for its request.

              <P>Federal law protects the privacy of your financial records. Before banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, credit card issuers, or other financial institutions may give financial information about you to a Federal agency, certain procedures must be followed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Consent to Financial Records</HD>
              <P>You may be asked to consent to the financial institution making your financial records available to the Government. You may withhold your consent, and your consent is not required as a condition of doing business with any financial institution. If you give your consent, it can be revoked in writing at any time before your records are disclosed. Furthermore, any consent you give is effective for only 3 months and your financial institution must keep a record of the instances in which it discloses your financial information.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Without Your Consent</HD>

              <P>Without your consent, a Federal agency that wants to see your financial records may do so ordinarily only by means of a lawful subpoena, summons, formal written request, or search warrant for that purpose. Generally, the Federal agency must give you advance notice of its request for your records explaining why the information is being sought and telling you how to object in court. The Federal agency must also send <PRTPAGE P="14"/>you copies of court documents to be prepared by you with instructions for filling them out. While these procedures will be kept as simple as possible, you may want to consult an attorney before making a challenge to a Federal agency's request.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Exceptions</HD>
              <P>In some circumstances, a Federal agency may obtain financial information about you without advance notice or your consent. In most of these cases, the Federal agency will be required to go to court for permission to obtain your records without giving you notice beforehand. In these instances, the court will make the Government show that its investigation and request for your records are proper. When the reason for the delay of notice no longer exists, you will usually be notified that your records were obtained.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Transfer of Information</HD>
              <P>Generally, a Federal agency that obtains your financial records is prohibited from transferring them to another Federal agency unless it certifies in writing the transfer is proper and sends a notice to you that your records have been sent to another agency.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Penalties</HD>
              <P>If the Federal agency or financial institution violates the Right to Financial Privacy Act, you may sue for damages or seek compliance with the law. If you win, you may be repaid your attorney's fee and costs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Individual privacy rights policy.</E> Army policy concerning the privacy rights of individuals and the Army's responsibilities for compliance with the Privacy Act are as follows—</P>
              <P>(1) Protect the privacy of United States living citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence from unwarranted intrusion.</P>
              <P>(2) Deceased individuals do not have Privacy Act rights, nor do executors or next-of-kin in general. However, immediate family members may have limited privacy rights in the manner of death details and funeral arrangements of the deceased individual. Family members often use the deceased individual's Social Security Number (SSN) for federal entitlements; appropriate safeguards must be implemented to protect the deceased individual's SSN from release. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act extends protection to certain medical information contained in a deceased individual's medical records.</P>
              <P>(3) Personally identifiable health information of individuals, both living and deceased, shall not be used or disclosed except for specifically permitted purposes.</P>
              <P>(4) Maintain only such information about an individual that is necessary to accomplish the Army's mission.</P>
              <P>(5) Maintain only personal information that is timely, accurate, complete, and relevant to the collection purpose.</P>
              <P>(6) Safeguard personal information to prevent unauthorized use, access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</P>
              <P>(7) Maintain records for the minimum time required in accordance with an approved National Archives and Records Administration record disposition.</P>

              <P>(8) Let individuals know what Privacy Act records the Army maintains by publishing Privacy Act system of records notices in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> This will enable individuals to review and make copies of these <PRTPAGE P="19"/>records, subject to the exemptions authorized by law and approved by the Secretary of the Army. Department of the Army Privacy Act systems of records notices are available at <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(9) Permit individuals to correct and amend records about themselves which they can prove are factually in error, not timely, not complete, not accurate, or not relevant.</P>
              <P>(10) Allow individuals to request an administrative review of decisions that deny them access to or the right to amend their records.</P>
              <P>(11) Act on all requests promptly, accurately, and fairly.</P>
              <P>(12) Keep paper and electronic records that are retrieved by name or personal identifier only in approved Privacy Act systems of records.</P>
              <P>(13) Maintain no records describing how an individual exercises his or her rights guaranteed by the First Amendment (freedom of religion, freedom of political beliefs, freedom of speech and press, freedom of peaceful assemblage, and petition) unless expressly authorized by statute, pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity, or otherwise authorized by law or regulation.</P>
              <P>(14) Maintain appropriate administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure records are protected from unauthorized alteration or disclosure.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Safeguard personal information.</E> (1) Privacy Act data will be afforded reasonable safeguards to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of records during processing, storage, transmission, and disposal.</P>
              <P>(2) Personal information should never be placed on shared drives that are accessed by groups of individuals unless each person has an “official need to know” the information in the performance of official duties.</P>
              <P>(3) Safeguarding methods must strike a balance between the sensitivity of the data, need for accuracy and reliability for operations, general security of the area, and cost of the safeguards. In some situations, a password may be enough protection for an automated system with a log-on protocol. For additional guidance on safeguarding personal information in automated records see AR 380-67, The Department of the Army Personnel Security Program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conveying privacy protected data electronically via e-mail and the World Wide Web.</E> (1) Unencrypted electronic transmission of privacy protected data makes the Army vulnerable to information interception which can cause serious harm to the individual and the accomplishment of the Army's mission.</P>
              <P>(2) The Privacy Act requires that appropriate technical safeguards be established, based on the media (e.g., paper, electronic) involved, to ensure the security of the records and to prevent compromise or misuse during transfer.</P>
              <P>(3) Privacy Web sites and hosted systems with privacy-protected data will employ secure sockets layers (SSL) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) encryption certificates or other DoD-approved commercially available certificates for server authentication and client/server authentication. Individuals who transmit data containing personally identifiable information over e-mail will employ PKI or other DoD-approved certificates.</P>
              <P>(4) When sending Privacy Act protected information within the Army using encrypted or dedicated lines, ensure that—</P>
              <P>(i) There is an “official need to know” for each addressee (including “cc” addressees); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Privacy Act protected information is marked For Official Use Only (FOUO) to inform the recipient of limitations on further dissemination. For example, add FOUO to the beginning of an e-mail message, along with the following language: “This contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which is protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 and AR 340-21, The Army Privacy Program. Do not further disseminate this information without the permission of the sender.”</P>
              <P>(iii) Do not indiscriminately apply this statement. Use it only in situations when actually transmitting protected Privacy Act information.</P>
              <P>(iv) For additional information about marking documents “FOUO” review AR 25-55, Chapter IV.</P>

              <P>(5) Add appropriate “Privacy and Security Notices” at major Web site <PRTPAGE P="20"/>entry points. Refer to AR 25-1, para 6-4n for requirements for posting “Privacy and Security Notices” on public Web sites. Procedures related to the establishing, operating, and maintaining of unclassified DA Web sites can be accessed at <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/webmasters/policy/DOD_web_policy.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Ensure public Web sites comply with policies regarding restrictions on persistent and third party cookies. The Army prohibits both persistent and third part cookies. (see AR 25-1, para 6-4n)</P>
              <P>(7) A Privacy Advisory is required on Web sites which host information systems soliciting personally identifying information, even when not maintained in a Privacy Act system of records. The Privacy Advisory informs the individual why the information is solicited and how it will be used. Post the Privacy Advisory to the Web site page where the information is being solicited, or to a well marked hyperlink stating “Privacy Advisory—Please refer to the Privacy and Security Notice that describes why this information is collected and how it will be used.”</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Protecting records containing personal identifiers such as names and Social Security Numbers.</E> (1) Only those records covered by a Privacy Act system of records notice may be arranged to permit retrieval by a personal identifier (e.g., an individual's name or Social Security Number). AR 25-400-2, paragraph 6-2 requires all records covered by a Privacy Act system of records notice to include the system of record identification number on the record label to serve as a reminder that the information contained within must be safeguarded.</P>
              <P>(2) Use a coversheet or DA Label 87 (For Official Use Only) for individual records not contained in properly labeled file folders or cabinets.</P>
              <P>(3) When developing a coversheet, the following is an example of a statement that you may use: “The information contained within is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) and protected by the Privacy Act of 1974.”</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of Individuals when personal information is lost, stolen, or compromised.</E> (1) Whenever an Army organization becomes aware the protected personal information pertaining to a Service member, civilian employee (appropriated or non-appropriated fund), military retiree, family member, or another individual affiliated with Army organization (e.g., volunteer) has been lost, stolen, or compromised, the organization shall inform the affected individuals as soon as possible, but not later than ten days after the loss or compromise of protected personal information is discovered.</P>
              <P>(2) At a minimum, the organization shall advise individuals of what specific data was involved; the circumstances surrounding the loss, theft, or compromise; and what protective actions the individual can take.</P>
              <P>(3) If Army organizations are unable to comply with policy, they will immediately notify their superiors, who will submit a memorandum through the chain of command to the Administrative Assistant of the Secretary of the Army to explain why the affected individuals or population's personal information has been lost, stolen, or compromised.</P>
              <P>(4) This policy is also applicable to Army contractors who collect, maintain, use, or disseminate protected personal information on behalf of the organization.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Federal government contractors' compliance.</E> (1) When a DA activity contracts for the design, development, or operation of a Privacy Act system of records in order to accomplish a DA mission, the agency must apply the requirements of the Privacy Act to the contractor and its employees working on the contract (See 48 CFR part 24 and other applicable supplements to the FAR; 32 CFR part 310).</P>
              <P>(2) System Managers will review annually, contracts contained within the system(s) of records under their responsibility, to determine which ones contain provisions relating to the design, development, or operation of a Privacy Act system of records.</P>
              <P>(3) Contractors are considered employees of the Army for the purpose of the sanction provisions of the Privacy Act during the performance of the contract requirements.</P>

              <P>(4) Disclosing records to a contractor for use in performing the requirements <PRTPAGE P="21"/>of an authorized DA contract is considered a disclosure within the agency under exception (b)(1), “Official Need to Know”, of the Act.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 505.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Privacy Act systems of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Systems of records.</E> (1) A system of records is a group of records under the control of a DA activity that are retrieved by an individual's name or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to an individual.</P>
              <P>(2) Privacy Act systems of records must be—</P>
              <P>(i) Authorized by Federal statute or an Executive Order;</P>
              <P>(ii) Needed to carry out DA's mission; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in a system of records notice, which will provide the public an opportunity to comment before DA implements or changes the system.</P>
              <P>(3) The mere fact that records are retrievable by a name or personal identifier is not enough. Records must actually be retrieved by a name or personal identifier. Records in a group of records that may be retrieved by a name or personal identifier but are not normally retrieved by this method are not covered by this part. However, they are covered by AR 25-55, the Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program.</P>
              <P>(4) The existence of a statute or Executive Order mandating the maintenance of a system of records to perform an authorized activity does not abolish the responsibility to ensure the information in the system of records is relevant and necessary to perform the authorized activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Privacy Act system of records notices.</E> (1) DA must publish notices in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on new, amended, altered, or deleted systems of records to inform the public of the Privacy Act systems of records that it maintains. The Privacy Act requires submission of new or significantly changed systems of records to OMB and both houses of Congress before publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (See Appendix E of this part).</P>
              <P>(2) Systems managers must send a proposed notice at least 120 days before implementing a new, amended or altered system to the DA Freedom of Information and Privacy Office. The proposed or altered notice must include a narrative statement and supporting documentation. A narrative statement must contain the following items:</P>
              <P>(i) System identifier and name;</P>
              <P>(ii) Responsible Official, title, and phone number;</P>
              <P>(iii) If a new system, the purpose of establishing the system or if an altered system, nature of changes proposed;</P>
              <P>(iv) Authority for maintenance of the system;</P>
              <P>(v) Probable or potential effects of the system on the privacy of individuals;</P>
              <P>(vi) Whether the system is being maintained, in whole or in part, by a contractor;</P>
              <P>(vii) Steps taken to minimize risk of unauthorized access;</P>
              <P>(viii) Routine use compatibility;</P>
              <P>(ix) Office of Management and Budget information collection requirements; and</P>

              <P>(x) Supporting documentation as an attachment. Also as an attachment should be the proposed new or altered system notice for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) An amended or altered system of records is one that has one or more of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A significant increase in the number, type, or category of individuals about whom records are maintained;</P>
              <P>(ii) A change that expands the types of categories of information maintained;</P>
              <P>(iii) A change that alters the purpose for which the information is used;</P>
              <P>(iv) A change to equipment configuration (either hardware or software) that creates substantially greater access to the records in the system of records;</P>
              <P>(v) An addition of an exemption pursuant to Section (j) or (k) of the Act; or</P>
              <P>(vi) An addition of a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(4) For additional guidance contact the DA FOIA/P Office.</P>

              <P>(5) On behalf of DA, the Defense Privacy Office maintains a list of DOD Components' Privacy Act system of records notices at the Defense Privacy Office's Web site <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="22"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) DA PAM 25-51 sets forth procedures pertaining to Privacy Act system of records notices.</P>
              <P>(7) For new systems, system managers must establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records. This applies to all new systems of records whether maintained manually or automated.</P>
              <P>(i) One safeguard plan is the development and use of a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) mandated by the E-Gov Act of 2002, Section 208. The Office of Management and Budget specifically directs that a PIA be conducted, reviewed, and published for all new or significantly altered information in identifiable form collected from or about the members of the public. The PIA describes the appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for new automated systems. This will assist in the protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of data, which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained. Contact your local Information Officer for guidance on conducting a PIA.</P>
              <P>(ii) The development of appropriate safeguards must be tailored to the requirements of the system as well as other factors, such as the system environment, location, and accessibility.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 505.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Collecting personal information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> (1) Employees will collect personal information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject of the record. This is especially critical, if the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs (<E T="03">See</E> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2)).</P>
              <P>(2) It is unlawful for any Federal, State, or local government agency to deny anyone a legal right, benefit, or privilege provided by law for refusing to give their SSN unless the law requires disclosure, or a law or regulation adopted before January 1, 1975, required the SSN or if DA uses the SSN to verify a person's identity in a system of records established and in use before that date. Executive Order 9397 (issued prior to January 1, 1975) authorizes the Army to solicit and use the SSN as a numerical identifier for individuals in most federal records systems. However, the SSN should only be collected as needed to perform official duties. Executive Order 9397 does not mandate the solicitation of SSNs from Army personnel as a means of identification.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon entrance into military service or civilian employment with DA, individuals are asked to provide their SSN. The SSN becomes the service or employment number for the individual and is used to establish personnel, financial, medical, and other official records. After an individual has provided his or her SSN for the purpose of establishing a record, the Privacy Act Statement is not required if the individual is only requested to furnish or verify the SSN for identification purposes in connection with the normal use of his or her records. If the SSN is to be used for a purpose other than identification, the individual must be informed whether disclosure of the SSN is mandatory or voluntary; by what statutory authority the SSN is solicited; and what uses will be made of the SSN. This notification is required even if the SSN is not to be maintained in a Privacy Act system of records.</P>
              <P>(4) When asking an individual for his or her SSN or other personal information that will be maintained in a system of records, the individual must be provided with a Privacy Act Statement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Privacy Act Statement (PAS).</E> (1) A Privacy Act Statement is required whenever personal information is requested from an individual and will become part of a Privacy Act system of records. The information will be retrieved by the individual's name or other personal identifier (<E T="03">See</E> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3)).</P>
              <P>(2) The PAS will ensure that individuals know why the information is being collected so they can make an informed decision as to providing the personal information.</P>

              <P>(3) In addition, the PAS will include language that is explicit, easily understood, and not so lengthy as to deter an individual from reading it.<PRTPAGE P="23"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) A sign can be displayed in areas where people routinely furnish this kind of information, and a copy of the PAS will be made available upon request by the individual.</P>
              <P>(5) Do not ask the person to sign the PAS.</P>
              <P>(6) A Privacy Act Statement must include the following four items—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Authority:</E> Cite the specific statute or Executive Order, including a brief title or subject that authorizes the DA to collect the personal information requested.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Principal Purpose (s):</E> Cite the principal purposes for which the information will be used.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Routine Uses:</E> A list of where and why the information will be disclosed OUTSIDE of DOD. Applicable routine uses are published in the applicable Privacy Act system of records notice(s). If none, the language to be used is: “Routine Use(s): None. However the ‘Blanket Routine Uses’ set forth at the beginning of the Army's compilation of systems of records notices apply.”</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Disclosure:</E> Voluntary or Mandatory. Include in the Privacy Act Statement specifically whether furnishing the requested personal data is mandatory or voluntary. A requirement to furnish personal data is mandatory ONLY when a federal statute, Executive Order, regulation, or other law specifically imposes a duty on the individual to provide the information sought, and when the individual is subject to a penalty if he or she fails to provide the requested information. If providing the information is only a condition of or prerequisite to granting a benefit or privilege and the individual has the option of receiving the benefit or privilege, providing the information is always voluntary. However, the loss or denial of the privilege, benefit, or entitlement sought must be listed as a consequence of not furnishing the requested information.</P>
              <P>(7) Some acceptable means of administering the PAS are as follows, in the order of preference—</P>
              <P>(i) Below the title of the media used to collect the personal information. The PAS should be positioned so that the individual will be advised of the PAS before he or she provides the requested information;</P>
              <P>(ii) Within the body with a notation of its location below the title;</P>
              <P>(iii) On the reverse side with a notation of its location below the title;</P>
              <P>(iv) Attached as a tear-off sheet; or</P>
              <P>(v) Issued as a separate supplement.</P>
              <P>(8) An example of a PAS is at appendix B of this part.</P>
              <P>(9) Include a PAS on a Web site page if it collects information directly from an individual and is retrieved by his or her name or personal identifier (See Office of Management and Budget Privacy Act Guidelines, 40 FR 28949, 28961 (July 9, 1975)).</P>
              <P>(10) Army policy prohibits the collection of personally identifying information on public Web sites without the express permission of the user. Requests for exceptions must be forwarded to the Army CIO/G-6. (See AR 25-1, para 6-4n.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Collecting personal information from third parties.</E> (1) It may not be practical to collect personal information directly from the individual in all cases. Some examples of when collection from third parties may be necessary are when—</P>
              <P>(i) Verifying information;</P>
              <P>(ii) Opinions or evaluations are needed;</P>
              <P>(iii) The subject cannot be contacted; or</P>
              <P>(iv) At the request of the subject individual.</P>
              <P>(2) When asking third parties to provide information about other individuals, they will be advised of—</P>
              <P>(i) The purpose of the request; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Their rights to confidentiality as defined by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Consult with your servicing Staff Judge Advocate for potential limitations to the confidentiality that may be offered pursuant to the Privacy Act).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Confidentiality promises.</E> Promises of confidentiality must be prominently annotated in the record to protect from disclosure any information provided in confidence pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), (k)(5), or (k)(7).</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 505.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Individual access to personal information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Individual access.</E> (1) The access provisions of this part are intended for use by individuals whose records are maintained in a Privacy Act system of <PRTPAGE P="24"/>records. If a representative acts on their behalf, a written authorization must be provided, with the exception of members of Congress acting on behalf of a constituent.</P>
              <P>(2) A Department of the Army “Blanket Routine Use” allows the release of Privacy Act protected information to members of Congress when they are acting on behalf of the constituent and the information is filed and retrieved by the constituent's name or personal identifier. The said “Blanket Routine Use” is listed below.</P>
              <P>“Congressional Inquiries Disclosure Routine Use: Disclosure from a system of records maintained by a DOD Component may be made to a congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an inquiry from the congressional office made at the request of that individual.”</P>
              <P>(3) Upon a written request, an individual will be granted access to information pertaining to him or her that is maintained in a Privacy Act system of records, unless—</P>

              <P>(i) The information is subject to an exemption, the system manager has invoked the exemption, and the exemption is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The information was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
              <P>(4) Legal guardians or parents acting on behalf of a minor child have the minor child's rights of access under this part, unless the records were created or maintained pursuant to circumstances where the interests of the minor child were adverse to the interests of the legal guardian or parent.</P>
              <P>(5) These provisions should allow for the maximum release of information consistent with Army and DOD's statutory responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Individual requests for access.</E> (1) Individuals will address requests for access to records in a Privacy Act system of records to the system manager or the custodian of the record designated in DA systems of records notices (See DA PAM 25-51 or the Defense Privacy Office's Web site <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy</E>).</P>
              <P>(2) Individuals do not have to state a reason or justify the need to gain access to records under the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) Release of personal information to individuals under this section is not considered a “public release” of information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Verification of identity for first party requesters.</E> (1) Before granting access to personal data, an individual will provide reasonable verification of identity.</P>
              <P>(2) When requesting records in writing, the preferred method of verifying identity is the submission of a notarized signature. An alternative method of verifying identity for individuals who do not have access to notary services is the submission of an un-sworn declaration in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746 in the following format:</P>
              <P>(i) If executed within the United States, its territories, possessions, or commonwealths: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature)”.</P>
              <P>(ii) If executed outside of the United States: “I declare under perjury or penalty under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).”</P>
              <P>(3) When an individual seeks access in person, identification can be verified by documents normally carried by the individual (such as identification card, driver's license, or other license, permit or pass normally used for identification purposes). However, level of proof of identity is commensurate with the sensitivity of the records sought. For example, more proof is required to access medical records than is required to access parking records.</P>
              <P>(4) Telephonic requests will not be honored.</P>
              <P>(5) An individual cannot be denied access solely for refusal to provide his or her Social Security Number (SSN) unless the SSN was required for access by statute or regulation adopted prior to January 1, 1975.</P>

              <P>(6) If an individual wishes to have his or her records released directly to a third party or to be accompanied by a third party when seeking access to his or her records, reasonable proof of authorization must be obtained. The individual may be required to furnish a <PRTPAGE P="25"/>signed access authorization with a notarized signature or other proof of authenticity (<E T="03">i.e.</E> telephonic confirmation) before granting the third party access.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Individual access to medical records.</E> (1) An individual must be given access to his or her medical and psychological records unless a judgment is made that access to such records could have an adverse effect on the mental or physical health of the individual. This determination normally should be made in consultation with a medical doctor. Additional guidance is provided in DOD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program. In this instance, the individual will be asked to provide the name of a personal health care provider, and the records will be provided to that health care provider, along with an explanation of why access without medical supervision could be harmful to the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) Information that may be harmful to the record subject should not be released to a designated individual unless the designee is qualified to make psychiatric or medical determinations.</P>
              <P>(3) DA activities may offer the services of a military physician, other than the one who provided the treatment.</P>
              <P>(4) Do not require the named health care provider to request the records for the individual.</P>
              <P>(5) The agency's decision to furnish the records to a medical designee and not directly to the individual is not considered a denial for reporting purposes under the Act and cannot be appealed.</P>
              <P>(6) However, no matter what the special procedures are, DA has a statutory obligation to ensure that access is provided the individual.</P>
              <P>(7) Regardless of age, all DA military personnel and all married persons are considered adults. The parents of these individuals do not have access to their medical records without written consent of the individual.</P>
              <P>(8) DOD 6025.18-R, DOD Health Information Privacy Regulation, issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, has placed additional procedural requirements on the uses and disclosure of individually identifiable health information beyond those found in the Privacy Act of 1974 and this part. In order to be in compliance with HIPAA, the additional guidelines and procedures will be reviewed before release of an individual's identifiable health information.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Personal notes.</E> (1) The Privacy Act does not apply to personal notes of individuals used as memory aids. These documents are not Privacy Act records and are not subject to this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The five conditions for documents to be considered personal notes are as follows—</P>
              <P>(i) Maintained and discarded solely at the discretion of the author;</P>
              <P>(ii) Created only for the author's personal convenience and the notes are restricted to that of memory aids;</P>
              <P>(iii) Not the result of official direction or encouragement, whether oral or written;</P>
              <P>(iv) Not shown to others for any reason; and</P>
              <P>(v) Not filed in agency files.</P>
              <P>(3) Any disclosure from personal notes, either intentional or through carelessness, removes the information from the category of memory aids and the personal notes then become subject to provisions of the Act.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Denial or limitation of individual's right to access.</E> (1) Even if the information is filed and retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier, his or her right to access may be denied if—</P>
              <P>(i) The records were compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding including any action where DA expects judicial or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. The term “civil action or proceeding” includes quasi-judicial, pre-trial judicial, and administrative proceedings, as well as formal litigation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The information is about a third party and does not pertain to the requester. A third party's SSN and home address will be withheld. However, information about the relationship between the individual and the third party would normally be disclosed as it pertains to the individual;</P>

              <P>(iii) The records are in a system of records that has been properly exempted by the Secretary of the Army from the access provisions of this part and the information is exempt from release <PRTPAGE P="26"/>under a provision of the Freedom of Information Act (See appendix C of this part for a list of applicable Privacy Act exemptions, exceptions, and “Blanket” routine uses);</P>
              <P>(iv) The records contain properly classified information that has been exempted from the access provision of this part;</P>
              <P>(v) The records are not described well enough to enable them to be located with a reasonable amount of effort on the part of an employee familiar with the file. Requesters should reasonably describe the records they are requesting. They do not have to designate a Privacy Act system of records notice identification number, but they should at least identify a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for “all records about me,” DA personnel should ask the requester for more information to narrow the scope of his or her request; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Access is sought by an individual who fails or refuses to comply with Privacy Act established procedural requirements, included refusing to pay fees.</P>
              <P>(2) Requesters will not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels for making Privacy Act requests. System managers will process such requests but inform requesters that using government resources to make Privacy Act requests is not authorized.</P>
              <P>(3) When a request for information contained in a Privacy Act system of records is denied in whole or in part, the Denial Authority or designee shall inform the requester in writing and explain why the request for access has been refused.</P>
              <P>(4) A request for access, notification, or amendment of a record shall be acknowledged in writing within 10 working days of receipt by the proper system manager or record custodian.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Relationship between the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.</E> (1) Not all requesters are knowledgeable of the appropriate statutory authority to cite when requesting information. In some instances, they may cite neither the PA nor the Freedom of Information Act in their request. In some instances they may cite one Act but not the other. The Freedom of Information Act and the PA works together to ensure that requesters receive the greatest amount of information possible.</P>
              <P>(2) Do not deny the individual access to his or her records simply because he or she failed to cite the appropriate statute or regulation.</P>
              <P>(3) If the records are required to be released under the Freedom of Information Act, the PA will never block disclosure to requester. If the PA allows the DA activity to deny access to an individual, the Freedom of Information Act must still be applied, and the information released if required by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
              <P>(4) Unlike the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act applies only to U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</P>
              <P>(5) Requesters who seek records about themselves contained in a Privacy Act system of records (1st party requesters) and who cite or imply only the Privacy Act, will have their request processed under the provisions of both the PA and the Freedom of Information Act. If the information requested is not contained in a Privacy Act system of records or is not about the requester, the individual's request will be processed under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act only, and the Freedom of Information Act processing requirements/time lines will apply.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Third party information.</E> (i) Third party information contained in a Privacy Act system of records that does not pertain to the requester, such as SSN, home addresses, and other purely personal information that is not about the requester, will be processed under the provisions of Freedom of Information Act only. Third party information that is not about the requester is not subject to the Privacy Act's first party access provision.</P>

              <P>(ii) Information about the relationship between the first party requester and a third party is normally disclosed as pertaining to the first party requester. Consult your servicing Staff Judge Advocate if there is a question about the release of third party information to a first party requester.<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) If an individual requests information about them contained in a Privacy Act system of records, the individual may be denied the information only if the information is exempt under both the PA and the Freedom of Information Act. Both PA and Freedom of Information Act exemptions will be cited in the denial letter and appeals will be processed in accordance with both Acts.</P>
              <P>(8) Each time a first party requester cites or implies the PA, perform this analysis:</P>
              <P>(i) Is the request from a United States living citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence?</P>
              <P>(ii) Is the individual requesting an agency record?</P>
              <P>(iii) Are the records within a PA system of records that are filed and retrieved by an individual's name or other personal identifier? (If the answer is “yes” to all of these questions, then the records should be processed under the “Privacy Act”) and</P>
              <P>(iv) Does the information requested pertain exclusively to the requester?</P>
              <P>(A) If yes, no further consideration of Freedom of Information Act exemptions required. Release all information unless a PA exemption authorizes withholding.</P>
              <P>(B) If no, process the information that is not about the requester under the Freedom of Information Act and withhold only if a proper Freedom of Information Act exemption applies.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Functional requests.</E> If an individual asks for his or her records and does not cite or reasonably imply either the Privacy Act or the Freedom of Information Act, and another prescribing directive or regulation authorizes the release, the records should be released under that other directive or regulation and not the PA or the FOIA. Examples of functional requests are military members asking to see their Official Military Personnel Records or civilian employees asking to see their Official Personnel Folder.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Procedures for denying or limiting an individual's right to access or amendment and the role of the Denial Authority.</E> (1) The only officials authorized to deny a request for records or a request to amend records in a PA system of records pertaining to the requesting individual, are the appropriate Denial Authorities, their designees, or the Secretary of the Army who will be acting through the General Counsel.</P>
              <P>(2) Denial Authorities are authorized to deny requests, either in whole or in part, for notification, access and amendment of Privacy Act records contained in their respective areas of responsibility.</P>
              <P>(i) The Denial Authority may delegate all or part of their authority to a division chief under his supervision within the Agency in the grade of 0-5/GS-14 or higher. All delegations must be in writing.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Denial Authority will send the names, office names, and telephones numbers of their delegates to the DA Freedom of Information and Privacy Office.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a Denial Authority delegate denies access or amendment, the delegate must clearly state that he or she is acting on behalf of the Denial Authority, who must be identified by name and position in the written response to the requester. Denial Authority designation will not delay processing privacy requests/actions.</P>
              <P>(iv) The official Denial Authorities are for records under their authority (See appendix B of this part). The individuals designated as Denial Authorities under this part are the same individuals designated as Initial Denial Authorities under AR 25-55, the Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program. However, delegation of Denial Authority pursuant to this part does not automatically encompass delegation of Initial Denial Authority under AR 25-55. Initial Denial Authority must be expressly delegated pursuant to AR 25-55 for an individual to take action on behalf of an Initial Denial Authority under AR 25-55.</P>
              <P>(3) The custodian of the record will acknowledge requests for access made under the provisions of the Privacy Act within 10 working days of receipt.</P>

              <P>(4) Requests for information recommended for denial will be forwarded to the appropriate Denial Authority, along with a copy of the records and justification for withholding the record. At the same time, notify the requester of the referral to the Denial <PRTPAGE P="28"/>Authority for action. All documents or portions thereof determined to be releasable to the requester will be released to the requester before forwarding the case to the Denial Authority.</P>
              <P>(5) Within 30 working days, the Denial Authority will provide the following notification to the requester in writing if the decision is to deny the requester access to the information.</P>
              <P>(6) Included in the notification will be:</P>
              <P>(i) Denying Official's name, position title, and business address;</P>
              <P>(ii) Date of the denial;</P>
              <P>(iii) The specific reason for the denial, citing the appropriate subsections of the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act, AR 25-55, The Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program and this part; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The individual's right to administratively appeal the denial within 60 calendar days of the mailing date of the notice, through the Denial Authority, to the Office of the General Counsel, Secretary of the Army, 104 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-0104.</P>
              <P>(7) The appeal must be in writing and the requester should provide a copy of the denial letter and a statement of their reasons for seeking review.</P>

              <P>(8) For denials made by the DA when the record is maintained in a Government-wide system of records, an individual's request for further review must be addressed to each of the appropriate government Privacy Act offices listed in the Privacy Act system of records notices. For a current listing of Government-wide Privacy Act system of records notices see the Defense Privacy Office's Web site <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy</E> or DA PAM 25-51.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">No records determinations.</E> (1) Since a no record response may be considered an “adverse” determination, the Denial Authority must make the final determination that no records exist. The originating agency shall notify the requester that an initial determination has been made that there are no responsive records, however the final determination will be made by the Denial Authority. A no records certificate must accompany a no records determination that is forwarded to the Denial Authority.</P>
              <P>(2) The Denial Authority must provide the requester with appeal rights.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Referral of requests.</E> (1) A request received by a DA activity having no records responsive to a request shall be referred to another DOD Component or DA activity, if the other Component or activity confirms that they have the requested records, or verifies that they are the proper custodian for that type of record. The requester will be notified of the referral. In cases where the DA activity receiving the request has reason to believe that the existence or nonexistence of the record may in itself be classified, that activity will consult the Component or activity having cognizance over the records in question before referring the request. If the Component or activity that is consulted determines that the existence or nonexistence of the records is in itself classified, the requester shall be so notified by the DA activity originally receiving the request that it can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the record, and no referral shall take place.</P>
              <P>(2) A DA activity shall refer a Privacy Act request for a classified record that it holds to another DOD Component, DA activity, or agency outside the Department of Defense, if the record originated in the other DOD Component, DA activity, or outside agency, or if the classification is derivative. The referring DA activity will provide the records and a release recommendation with the referral action.</P>
              <P>(3) Any DA activity receiving a request that has been misaddressed will refer the request to the proper address and advise the requester.</P>
              <P>(4) Within DA, referrals will be made directly to offices having custody of the requested records (unless the Denial Authority is the custodian of the requested records). If the office receiving the Privacy Act request does not know where the requested records are located, the office will contact the DA FOIA/P Office, to determine the appropriate office for referral.</P>

              <P>(5) The requester will be informed of the referral whenever records or a portion of records are, after prior consultation, referred to another activity for a release determination and direct <PRTPAGE P="29"/>response. Additionally, the DA activity referral letter will accomplish the following—</P>
              <P>(i) Fully describe the Privacy Act system of records from which the document was retrieved; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Indicate whether the referring activity claims any exemptions in the Privacy Act system of records notice.</P>
              <P>(6) Within the DA, an activity will refer a Privacy Act request for records that it holds but was originated by another activity, to the originating activity for direct response. An activity will not, in any case, release or deny such records without prior consultation with the originating activity. The requester will be notified of such referral.</P>
              <P>(7) A DA activity may refer a Privacy Act request for records that originated in an agency outside of DOD, or that is based on information obtained from an agency outside the DOD, to that agency for direct response to the requester, only if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act. Otherwise, the DA activity must respond to the request.</P>
              <P>(8) DA activities will not honor any Privacy Act requests for investigative, intelligence, or any other type of records that are on loan to the Department of Defense for a specific purpose, if the records are restricted from further release in writing. Such requests will be referred to the agency that provided the records.</P>
              <P>(9) A DA activity will notify requesters seeking National Security Council (NSC) or White House documents that they should write directly to the NSC or White House for such documents. DA documents in which the NSC or White House have a concurrent reviewing interest will be forwarded to the Department of Defense, Office of Freedom of Information and Security Review, which will coordinate with the NSC or White House, and return the documents to the originating DA activity after NSC or White House review. NSC or White House documents discovered in DA activity files which are responsive to a Privacy Act request will be forwarded to DOD for coordination and return with a release determination.</P>
              <P>(10) To the extent referrals are consistent with the policies expressed above; referrals between offices of the same DA activity are authorized.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Reproduction fees.</E> (1) Use fees only to recoup direct reproduction costs associated with granting access.</P>
              <P>(2) DA activities may use discretion in their decision to charge for the first copy of records provided to an individual to whom the records pertain. Thereafter, fees will be computed pursuant to the fee schedule set forth in AR 25-55, including the fee waiver provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) Checks or money orders for fees should be made payable to the Treasurer of the United States and will be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts of the treasury account maintained at the activity's finance office.</P>
              <P>(4) Reproduction costs shall only include the direct costs of reproduction and shall not include costs of—</P>
              <P>(i) Time or effort devoted to searching for or reviewing the records by personnel;</P>
              <P>(ii) Fees not associated with the actual cost of reproduction;</P>
              <P>(iii) Producing a copy when it must be provided to the individual without cost under another regulation, directive, or law;</P>
              <P>(iv) Normal postage;</P>
              <P>(v) Transportation of records or personnel; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Producing a copy when the individual has requested only to review the records and has not requested a copy, and the only means of allowing review is to make a copy (e.g., the records are stored in a computer and a copy must be printed to provide individual access, or the activity does not wish to surrender temporarily the original records for the individual to review).</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Privacy Act case files.</E> (1) Whenever an individual submits a Privacy Act request, a case file will be established. This Privacy Act case file is a specific type of file that is governed by a specific Privacy Act system of records notice. In no instance will the individual's Privacy Act request and corresponding Army actions be included in the individual's military personnel file or other military filing systems, such as adverse action files or general legal files, and in no instance will the Privacy Act case file be used <PRTPAGE P="30"/>to make an adverse determination about the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) The case file will be comprised of the request for access/amendment, grants, refusals, coordination action(s), and all related papers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Amendment of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Amended records.</E> (1) Individuals are encouraged to periodically review the information maintained about them in Privacy Act systems of records and to familiarize themselves with the amendment procedures established by this part.</P>
              <P>(2) An individual may request to amend records that are retrieved by his or her name or personal identifier from a system of records unless the system has been exempted from the amendment provisions of the Act. The standard for amendment is that the records are inaccurate as a matter of fact rather than judgment, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The burden of proof is on the requester.</P>
              <P>(3) The system manager or custodian must review Privacy Act records for accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.</P>
              <P>(4) Amendment procedures are not intended to permit individuals to challenge events in records that have actually occurred. Amendment procedures only allow individuals to amend those items that are factually inaccurate and not matters of official judgment (e.g., performance ratings, promotion potential, and job performance appraisals). In addition, an individual is not permitted to amend records for events that have been the subject of judicial or quasi-judicial actions/proceedings.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proper amendment requests.</E> (1) Amendment requests, except for routine administrative changes, will be in writing.</P>
              <P>(2) When acting on behalf of a first party requester, an individual must provide written documentation of the first party requester's consent to allow the individual to view his or her records.</P>
              <P>(3) Amendment is appropriate if it can be shown that—</P>
              <P>(i) Circumstances leading up to the recorded event were found to be inaccurately reflected in the document;</P>
              <P>(ii) The record is not identical to the individual's copy; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The document was not constructed in accordance with the applicable recordkeeping requirements prescribed in AR 25-400-2, The Army Records Information Management System (ARIMS).</P>
              <P>(4) Under the amendment provisions, an individual may not challenge the merits of an adverse determination.</P>
              <P>(5) U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) reports of investigations (PA system of records notice A0195-2a USACIDC, Source Register; A0195-2b USACIDC, Criminal Investigation and Crime Laboratory Files) have been exempted from the amendment provisions of the Privacy Act. Requests to amend these reports will be considered under AR 195-2. Actions taken by the Commander of U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command will constitute final action on behalf of the Secretary of the Army under that regulation.</P>
              <P>(6) Records placed in the National Archives are exempt from the Privacy Act provision allowing individuals to request amendment of records. Most provisions of the Privacy Act apply only to those systems of records that are under the legal control of the originating agency; for example, an agency's current operating files or records stored at a Federal Records Center.</P>
              <P>(7) Inspector General investigative files and action request/complaint files (records in system notice A0021-1 SAIG, Inspector General Records) have been exempted from the amendment provisions of the Privacy Act. Requests to amend these reports will be considered under AR 20-1 by the Inspector General. Action by the Inspector General will constitute final action on behalf of the Secretary of the Army under that regulation.</P>
              <P>(8) Other records that are exempt from the amendment provisions of the Privacy Act are listed in the applicable PA system of records notices.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment procedures.</E> (1) Requests to amend records should be addressed to the custodian or system manager of the records. The request must reasonably describe the records to be amended and the changes sought <PRTPAGE P="31"/>(e.g., deletion, addition, or amendment). The burden of proof is on the requester. The system manager or records custodian will provide the individual with a written acknowledgment of the request within 10 working days and will make a final response within 30 working days of the date the request was received. The acknowledgment must clearly identify the request and inform the individual that final action will be forthcoming within 30 working days.</P>
              <P>(2) Records for which amendment is sought must be reviewed by the proper system manager or custodian for accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.</P>
              <P>(3) If the amendment is appropriate, the system manager or custodian will physically amend the records accordingly. The requester will be notified of such action.</P>
              <P>(4) If the amendment is not warranted, the request and all relevant documents, including reasons for not amending, will be forwarded to the proper Denial Authority within 10 working days to ensure that the 30 day time limit for the final response is met. In addition, the requester will be notified of the referral.</P>
              <P>(5) Based on the documentation provided, the Denial Authority will either amend the records and notify the requester and the custodian of the records of all actions taken, or deny the request. If the records are amended, those who have received the records in the past will receive notice of the amendment.</P>
              <P>(6) If the Denial Authority determines that the amendment is not warranted, he or she will provide the requester and the custodian of the records reason(s) for not amending. In addition, the Denial Authority will send the requester an explanation regarding his or her right to seek further review by the DA Privacy Act Review Board, through the Denial Authority, and the right to file a concise “Statement of Disagreement” to append to the individual's records.</P>
              <P>(i) On receipt of a request for further review by the Privacy Act Review Board, the Denial Authority will append any additional records or background information that substantiates the refusal or renders the case complete;</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 5 working days of receipt, forward the appeal to the DA Privacy Act Review Board; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Append the servicing Judge Advocate's legal review, including a determination that the Privacy Act Review Board packet is complete.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">DA Privacy Act Review Board.</E> (1) The DA Privacy Act Review Board acts on behalf of the Secretary of the Army in deciding appeals of the appropriate Denial Authority's refusal to amend records.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board will process an appeal within 30 working days of its receipt. The General Counsel may authorize an additional 30 days when unusual circumstances and good cause so warrant.</P>
              <P>(3) The Board membership consists of the following principal members, comprised of three voting and two non-voting members, or their delegates.</P>
              <P>(4) Three voting members include—</P>
              <P>(i) Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army (AASA) who acts as the Chairman of the Board;</P>
              <P>(ii) The Judge Advocate General; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The Chief, DA Freedom of Information and Privacy Division, U.S. Army Records Management and Declassification Agency.</P>
              <P>(5) In addition, two non-voting members include—</P>
              <P>(i) The Chief Attorney, OAASA (or designee) who serves as the legal advisor and will be present at all Board sessions to provide legal advice as required; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Recording Secretary provided by the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">DA Privacy Act Review Board meetings.</E> (1) The meeting of the Board requires the presence of all five members or their designated representatives. Other non-voting members with subject matter expertise may participate in a meeting of the Board, at the discretion of the Chairman.</P>
              <P>(2) Majority vote of the voting members is required to make a final determination on a request before the Board.</P>

              <P>(3) Board members, who have denial authority, may not vote on a matter upon which they took Denial Authority action. However, an individual who <PRTPAGE P="32"/>took Denial Authority action, or his or her representative, may serve as a non-voting member when the Board considers matters in the Denial Authority's area of functional specialization.</P>
              <P>(4) The Board may seek additional information, including the requester's official personnel file, if relevant and necessary to decide the appeal.</P>
              <P>(5) If the Board determines that an amendment is warranted (the record is inaccurate as a matter of fact rather than judgment, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete) it will amend the record and notify the requester, the Denial Authority, the custodian of the record, and any prior recipients of the record, of the amendment.</P>
              <P>(6) If the Board determines that amendment is unwarranted, they will—</P>
              <P>(i) Obtain the General Counsel's concurrence in writing;</P>
              <P>(ii) Respond to the requester with the reasons for denial; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Inform the requester of the right to file a “Statement of Disagreement” with the Board's action and to seek judicial review of the Army's refusal to amend. A “Statement of Disagreement” must be received by the system manager within 120 days and it will be made an integral part of the pertinent record. Anyone who may have access to, use of, or need to disclose information from the record will be aware that the record was disputed. The disclosing authority may include a brief summary of the Board's reasons for not amending the disputed record.</P>
              <P>(7) It is inappropriate for the Privacy Act Review Board to consider any record which is exempt from the amendment provision of the Privacy Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disclosure of personal information to other agencies and third parties.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Disclosing records to third parties.</E> (1) DA is prohibited from disclosing a record from a Privacy Act system of records to any person or agency without the prior written consent of the subject of the record, except when—</P>
              <P>(i) Pursuant to the twelve Privacy Act exceptions. The twelve exceptions to the “no disclosure without consent” rule are those exceptions which permit the release of personal information without the individual's/subject's consent (See appendix C of this part).</P>
              <P>(ii) The FOIA requires the release of the record. One of the twelve exceptions to Privacy Act is the FOIA Exception. If the FOIA requires the release of information, the information must be released. The Privacy Act can not prevent release to a third party if the FOIA requires release. However, information must not be discretionarily released under the FOIA if the information is subject to the Privacy Act's “no disclosure without consent” rule.</P>

              <P>(iii) A routine use applies. Another major exception to the “no disclosure without consent” rule is the routine use exception. The Privacy Act allows federal agencies to publish routine use exceptions to the Privacy Act. Some routine uses are Army specific, DOD specific, and Governmentwide. Routine uses exceptions are listed in the Privacy Act system of records notice(s) applicable to the Privacy Act records in question. The Army and other agencies' system of records notices may be accessed at the Defense Privacy Office's Web site <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The approved twelve exceptions to the Privacy Act “no disclosure without consent” rule are listed at appendix C of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosing records to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD.</E> (1) The twelve Privacy Act exceptions referred to in appendix C of this part are available to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD as exceptions to the Privacy Act's “no disclosure without consent” rule, with the exception of the FOIA exception. The FOIA is not an appropriate mechanism for providing information to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD.</P>
              <P>(2) A widely used exception to requests for information from local and state government agencies and federal agencies not within the DOD is the routine use exception to the Privacy Act.</P>

              <P>(3) The most widely used exception to requests for information from other DOD components is the “intra-agency <PRTPAGE P="33"/>need to know” exception to the Privacy Act. Officers and employees of the DOD who have an official need for the records in the performance of their official duties are entitled to Privacy Act protected information. Rank, position, or title alone does not authorize access to personal information about others. An official need for the information must exist before disclosure.</P>
              <P>(4) For the purposes of disclosure and disclosure accounting, the Department of Defense (DOD) is considered a single agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Disclosures under AR 25-55, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program.</E> (1) Despite Privacy Act protections, all records must be disclosed if the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires their release. The FOIA requires release unless the information is exempted by one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions.</P>
              <P>(2) Required release under the FOIA. The following are examples of personal information that is generally not exempt from the FOIA; therefore, it must be released to the public, unless covered by paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. The following list is not all inclusive:</P>
              <P>(i) Military Personnel—</P>
              <P>(A) Rank, date of rank, active duty entry date, basic pay entry date, and gross pay (including base pay, special pay, and all allowances except Basic Allowance for Housing);</P>
              <P>(B) Present and past duty assignments, future stateside assignments;</P>
              <P>(C) Office/unit name, duties address and telephone number (DOD policy may require withholding of this information in certain circumstances);</P>
              <P>(D) Source of commission, promotion sequence number, military awards and decorations, and professional military education;</P>
              <P>(E) Duty status, at any given time;</P>
              <P>(F) Separation or retirement dates;</P>
              <P>(G) Military occupational specialty (MOS);</P>
              <P>(H) Active duty official attendance at technical, scientific or professional meetings; and</P>
              <P>(I) Biographies and photos of key personnel (DOD policy may require withholding of this information in certain circumstances).</P>
              <P>(ii) Federal civilian employees—</P>
              <P>(A) Present and past position titles, occupational series, and grade;</P>
              <P>(B) Present and past annual salary rates (including performance awards or bonuses, incentive awards, merit pay amount, Meritorious or Distinguished Executive Ranks, and allowances and differentials);</P>
              <P>(C) Present and past duty stations;</P>
              <P>(D) Office or duty telephone number (DOD policy may require withholding of this information in certain circumstances); and</P>
              <P>(E) Position descriptions, identification of job elements, and performance standards (but not actual performance appraisals), the release of which would not interfere with law enforcement programs or severely inhibit agency effectiveness. Performance elements and standards (or work expectations) may also be withheld when they are so intertwined with performance appraisals, the disclosure would reveal an individual's performance appraisal.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Personal information that requires protection.</E> (1) The following are examples of information that is generally NOT releasable without the written consent of the subject. This list is not all inclusive—</P>
              <P>(i) Marital status;</P>
              <P>(ii) Dependents' names, sex and SSN numbers;</P>
              <P>(iii) Civilian educational degrees and major areas of study (unless the request for the information relates to the professional qualifications for Federal employment);</P>
              <P>(iv) School and year of graduation;</P>
              <P>(v) Home of record;</P>
              <P>(vi) Home address and phone;</P>
              <P>(vii) Age and date of birth;</P>
              <P>(viii) Overseas assignments (present or future);</P>
              <P>(ix) Overseas office or unit mailing address and duty phone of routinely deployable or sensitive units;</P>
              <P>(x) Race/ethnic origin;</P>
              <P>(xi) Educational level (unless the request for the information relates to professional qualifications for federal employment);</P>
              <P>(xii) Social Security Number (SSN); and</P>

              <P>(xiii) The information that would otherwise be protected from mandatory disclosure under a FOIA exemption.<PRTPAGE P="34"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The Office of the Secretary of Defense issued a policy memorandum in 2001 that provided greater protection of DOD personnel in the aftermath of 9/11 by requiring information that personally identifies DOD personnel be more carefully scrutinized and limited. In general, the Department of Defense has specifically advised that DOD components are not to release lists of names, duty addresses, present or past position titles, grades, salaries, and performance standards of DOD military members and civilian employees. At the office director level or above, the release of information will be limited to the name, official title, organization, and telephone number, provided a determination is made that disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns. No other information, including room numbers, will normally be released about these officials. Consistent with current policy, information on officials below the office director level may continue to be released if their positions or duties require frequent interaction with the public.</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure of records pertaining to personnel of overseas, sensitive, or routinely deployed units shall be prohibited to the extent authorized by 10 U.S.C. 130b.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Release of home addresses and home telephone numbers.</E> (1) The release of home addresses and home telephone numbers normally is prohibited. This release is normally considered a clearly “unwarranted invasion” of personal privacy and is exempt from mandatory release under the FOIA. However, home addresses and home telephone numbers may still be released if—</P>
              <P>(i) The individual has indicated previously in writing that he or she has no objection to the release;</P>
              <P>(ii) The source of the information to be released is a public document such as commercial telephone directory or other public listing;</P>
              <P>(iii) The release is required by Federal statute (for example, pursuant to federally funded state programs to locate parents who have defaulted on child support payments) (See 42 U.S.C. 653); or</P>
              <P>(iv) The releasing of information is pursuant to the routine use exception or the “intra-agency need to know” exception to the Privacy Act.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for a home address or telephone number may be referred to the last known address of the individual for a direct reply by the individual to the requester. In such cases, the requester shall be notified of the referral.</P>
              <P>(3) Do not sell or rent lists of individual names and addresses unless such action is specifically authorized by the appropriate authority.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Emergency recall rosters.</E> (1) The release of emergency recall rosters normally is prohibited. Their release is normally considered a clearly “unwarranted invasion” of personal privacy and is exempt from mandatory release under the FOIA. Emergency recall rosters should only be shared with those who have an “official need to know” the information, and they should be marked “For Official Use Only” (See AR 25-55).</P>
              <P>(2) Do not include a person's SSN on an emergency recall roster or their spouse's name.</P>
              <P>(3) Commanders and supervisors should give consideration to those individuals with unlisted phone numbers. Commanders and supervisors should consider limiting access to an unlisted number within the unit.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Social rosters.</E> (1) Before including personal information such as a spouse's name, home addresses, home phone numbers, and similar information on social rosters or social directories, which will be shared with individuals, always ask for the individual's written consent. Without their written consent, do not include this information.</P>
              <P>(2) Collection of this information will require a Privacy Act Statement which clearly tells the individual what information is being solicited, the purpose, to whom the disclosure of the information is made, and whether collection of the information is voluntary or mandatory.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Disclosure of personal information on group orders.</E> (1) Personal information will not be posted on group orders so that everyone on the orders can view it. Such a disclosure of personal information violates the Privacy Act and this part.<PRTPAGE P="35"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The following are some examples of personal information that should not be contained in group orders. The following list is not all-inclusive—</P>
              <P>(i) Complete SSN;</P>
              <P>(ii) Home addresses and phone numbers; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Date of birth.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Disclosures for established routine uses.</E> (1) Records may be disclosed outside the DOD without the consent of the individual to whom they pertain for an established routine use.</P>
              <P>(2) A routine use shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Be compatible with and related to the purpose for which the record was compiled;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify the persons or organizations to which the records may be released; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Have been published previously in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Establish a routine use for each user of the information outside the Department of Defense who needs official access to the records.</P>

              <P>(4) Routine uses may be established, discontinued, or amended without the consent of the individuals involved. However, new or changed routine uses must be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> at least 30 days before actually disclosing any records.</P>
              <P>(5) In addition to the routine uses listed in the applicable systems of records notices, “Blanket Routine Uses” for all DOD maintained systems of records have been established. These “Blanket Routine Uses” are applicable to every record system maintained within the DOD unless specifically stated otherwise within a particular record system. The “Blanket Routine Uses” are listed at appendix C of this part.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Disclosure accounting.</E> (1) System managers must keep an accurate record of all disclosures made from DA Privacy Act system of records, including those made with the consent of the individual, except when records are—</P>
              <P>(i) Disclosed to DOD officials who have a “need to know” the information to perform official government duties; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
              <P>(2) The purpose for the accounting of disclosure is to—</P>
              <P>(i) Enable an individual to ascertain those persons or agencies that have received information about them;</P>
              <P>(ii) Enable the DA to notify past recipients of subsequent amendments or “Statements of Dispute” concerning the record; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide a record of DA compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, if necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) Since the characteristics of records maintained within DA vary widely, no uniform method for keeping the disclosure accounting is prescribed.</P>
              <P>(4) Essential elements to include in each disclosure accounting report are—</P>
              <P>(i) The name, position title, and address of the person making the disclosure;</P>
              <P>(ii) Description of the record disclosed;</P>
              <P>(iii) The date, method, and purpose of the disclosure; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The name, position title, and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure was made.</P>
              <P>(5) The record subject has the right of access to the disclosure accounting except when—</P>
              <P>(i) The disclosure was made for law enforcement purposes under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The disclosure was made from a system of records for which an exemption from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) has been claimed.</P>
              <P>(6) There are no approved filing procedures for the disclosure of accounting records; however, system managers must be able to retrieve upon request. With this said, keep disclosure accountings for 5 years after the disclosure, or for the life of the record, whichever is longer.</P>
              <P>(7) When an individual requests such an accounting, the system manager or designee will respond within 20 working days.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use and establishment of exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Three types of exemptions.</E> (1) There are three types of exemptions applicable to an individual's right to access permitted by the Privacy Act. They are the Special, General, and Specific exemptions.</P>
              <P>(2) Special exemption (d)(5)—Relieves systems of records from the access provision of the Privacy Act only. This exemption applies to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
              <P>(3) General exemption (j)(2)—Relieves systems of records from most requirements of the Act. Only Army activities actually engaged in the enforcement of criminal laws as their primary function may claim this exemption.</P>
              <P>(4) Specific exemptions (k)(1)-(k)(7)-Relieves systems of records from only a few provisions of the Act.</P>

              <P>(5) To find out if an exemption is available for a particular record, refer to the applicable system of records notices. System of records notices will state which exemptions apply to a particular type of record. System of records notices that are applicable to the Army are contained in DA Pam 25-51 (available at the Army Publishing Directorate Web site <E T="03">http://www.usapa.army.mil/</E>), the Defense Privacy Office's Web site <E T="03">http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/</E>), or in this section). Some of the system of records notices apply only to the Army and the DOD and some notices are applicable government-wide.</P>
              <P>(6) Descriptions of current exemptions are listed in detail at appendix C of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemption procedures.</E> (1) For the General and Specific exemptions to be applicable to the Army, the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="37"/>of the Army must promulgate exemption rules to implement them. This requirement is not applicable to the one Special exemption which is self-executing. Once an exemption is made applicable to the Army through the exemption rules, it will be listed in the applicable system of records notices to give notice of which specific types of records the exemption applies to. When a system manager seeks to have an exemption applied to a certain Privacy Act system of records that is not currently provided for by an existing system of records notice, the following information will be furnished to the DA FOIA/P Office—</P>
              <P>(i) Applicable system of records notice;</P>
              <P>(ii) Exemption sought; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Justification.</P>

              <P>(2) After appropriate staffing and approval by the Secretary of the Army and the Defense Privacy Office, it will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a proposed rule, followed by a final rule 60 days later. No exemption may be invoked until these steps have been completed.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rulemaking procedures.</E> (1) DA Privacy Program procedures and exemption rules are subject to the formal rulemaking process.</P>

              <P>(2) Privacy Act system of records notices are not subject to formal rulemaking and are published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as Notices, not Rules.</P>
              <P>(3) The Privacy Program procedures and exemption rules are incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Privacy Act system of records notices are not published in the CFR.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Part 505—Exemptions, Exceptions, and DoD Blanket Routine Uses</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Special exemption.</E> 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5)—Denies individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General and specific exemptions.</E> The Secretary of the Army may exempt Army systems of records from certain requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974. The two kinds of exemptions that require Secretary of the Army enactment are general and specific exemptions. The general exemption authorizes the exemption of a system of records from most requirements of the Act; the specific exemptions authorize the exemption of a system of record from only a few.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">General exemptions.</E> Only Army activities actually engaged in the enforcement of criminal laws as their principal function may claim the general exemption. See 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). To qualify for this exemption, a system must consist of:</P>
              <P>(1) Information compiled to identify individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders, which consists only of identifying data and arrest records; type and disposition of charges; sentencing, confinement, and release records; and parole and probation status;</P>
              <P>(2) Information compiled for the purpose of criminal investigation including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or</P>
              <P>(3) Reports identifiable to an individual, compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws, from arrest or indictment through release from supervision.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific exemptions.</E> The Secretary of the Army has exempted all properly classified information and systems of records that have the following kinds of information listed in this section, from certain parts of the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act exemption reference appears in parentheses after each category.</P>
              <P>(1) Classified information in every Army system of records. Before denying any individual access to classified information, the Access and Amendment Refusal Authority must make sure that it was properly classified under the standards of Executive Orders 11652, 12065, or 12958 and that it must remain so in the interest of national defense of foreign policy (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1)).</P>
              <P>(2) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes (other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if this information has been used to deny someone a right, privilege or benefit to which the individual is entitled by Federal law, or for which an individual would otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information, it must be released, unless doing so would reveal the identity of a confidential source. Note: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions.</P>
              <P>(3) Records maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals protected pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C., section 3056 (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(3)).</P>
              <P>(4) Records maintained solely for statistical research or program evaluation purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the rights, benefits, or entitlements of individuals, except for census records which may be disclosed under Title 13 U.S.C., section 8 (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4)).</P>
              <P>(5) Investigatory material compiled solely to determine suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal service, Federal contracts, or access to classified information. This information may be withheld only to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5)).</P>
              <P>(6) Testing or examination material used solely to determine if a person is qualified for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. This information may be withheld only if disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the examination process (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6)).</P>
              <P>(7) Evaluation material used solely to determine promotion potential in the Armed Forces. Information may be withheld, but only to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7)).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> When a system manager seeks an exemption for a system of records, the following information will be furnished to the Chief Information Officer, 107 Army Pentagon, Room 3E608, Washington, DC 20310-0107; applicable system notice, exemptions sought, and justification. After appropriate staffing and approval by the Secretary of the Army, a proposed rule will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> followed by a final rule 60 days later. No exemption may <PRTPAGE P="43"/>be invoked until these steps have been completed.</P>

              <P>(f) The Army system of records notices for a particular type of record will state whether the Secretary of the Army has authorized a particular general and specific exemption to a certain type of record. The Army system of records notices are published on the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Division's Web site: <E T="03">http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/DODComponentArticleList/tabid/6799/Category/278/department-of-the-army.aspx</E>
              </P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exempt Army records.</E> The following records may be exempt from certain parts of the Privacy Act:</P>
              <P>(1) System identifier: A0020-1 SAIG.</P>
              <P>(i) System name: Inspector General Records.</P>
              <P>(ii) Exemptions: (A) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such information, the individual will be provided access to such information except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(B) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(C) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5) from subsections 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f).</P>
              <P>(iii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and(k)(5).</P>
              <P>(iv) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting would permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(B) From subsection (d) because access to such records contained in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(C) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal investigations, information is often obtained concerning the violations of laws or civil obligations of others not relating to an active case or matter. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary that this valuable information is retained since it can aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide valuable leads for other agencies and future cases that may be brought.</P>
              <P>(D) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (e)(4)(H) because portions of this system of records have been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d), making these subsections not applicable.</P>
              <P>(E) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</P>
              <P>(F) From subsection (f) because portions of this system of records have been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(2) System identifier: A0 025-400-2 0AA.</P>
              <P>(i) System name: Army Records Information Management System (ARIMS)</P>
              <P>(ii) Exemption: During the course of records management, declassification and claims research, exempt materials from other systems of records may in turn become part of the case record in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those “other” systems of records are entered into this system, the Department of the Army hereby claims the same exemptions for the records from those “other” systems.</P>
              <P>(iii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) and (k)(1) through (k)(7).</P>
              <P>(iv) Reasons: Records are only exempt from pertinent provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a to the extent such provisions have been identified and an exemption claimed for the original record and the purposes underlying the exemption for the original record still pertain to the record which is now contained in this system of records. In general, the exemptions were claimed in order to protect properly classified information relating to national defense and foreign policy, to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative actions or investigations, to ensure protective services provided to the President and others are not compromised, to protect records used solely as statistical records, to protect the identity of confidential sources incident to Federal employment, military service, contract, and security clearance determinations, to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of Federal testing materials, and to safeguard evaluation materials used for military promotions when furnished by a confidential source. The exemption rule for the original records will identify the specific reasons why the records may be exempt from specific provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.</P>

              <P>(ii) Exemption: During the processing of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, exempt materials from other systems of records may in turn become part of the case record in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those “other” systems of records are entered into this system, the Department of the Army claims the same exemptions for the records from those “other” systems.</P>
              <P>(iii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(1) through (k)(7).</P>
              <P>(iv) Reasons: Records are only exempt from pertinent provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a to the extent such provisions have been identified and an exemption claimed for the original record and the purposes underlying the exemption for the original record still pertain to the record which is now contained in this system of records.

              <P>(4) System identifier: A0027-1 DAJA.</P>
              <P>(i) System name: General Legal Files.</P>
              <P>(ii) Exemption: (A) Information specifically authorized to be classified under E.O. 12958, as implemented by DoD 5200.1-R, may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).</P>
              <P>(B) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such information, the individual will be provided access to such information except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(C) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(D) Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process.</P>
              <P>(E) Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(F) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) through(k)(7) from subsections 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f).</P>
              <P>(iii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (k)(2), (k)(5), (k)(6), and (k)(7).</P>
              <P>(iv) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting would permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>

              <P>(E) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection.</P>

              <P>(D) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal investigations, information is often obtained concerning the violation of laws or civil obligations of others not relating to an active case or matter. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary that this valuable information be retained since it can aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide valuable leads for other agencies and future cases that may be brought.</P>
              <P>(E) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation, the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection.</P>
              <P>(F) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential informants.</P>

This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</P>
              <P>(I) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment reporting on investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(J) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.</P>
              <P>(K) From subsection (f) because portions of this system of records have been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(L) From subsection (g) because portions of this system of records are compiled for law enforcement purposes and have been exempted from the access provisions of subsections (d) and (f).</P>

              <P>(B) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(C) Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>

              <P>(iv) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting would permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(B) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d), making this subsection not applicable.</P>
              <P>(C) From subsection (d) because access to such records contained in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(D) From subsection (e)(1) because the nature of the criminal and/or civil investigative function creates unique problems in prescribing a specific parameter in a particular case with respect to what information is relevant or necessary. Also, information may be received which may relate to a case under the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. The maintenance of this information may be necessary to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement purposes and to establish patterns of activity that may relate to the jurisdiction of other cooperating agencies.</P>
              <P>(E) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation, the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection.</P>
              <P>(F) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential informants.</P>
              <P>(G) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (e)(4)(H) because the requirements in those subsections are inapplicable to the extent that portions of this system of records may be exempt from subsection (d), concerning individual access.</P>
              <P>(H) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</P>
              <P>(I) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(J) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.</P>

However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled <PRTPAGE P="65"/>by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such information, such material shall be provided to the individual, except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from subsections 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f).</P>
              <P>(iii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).</P>
              <P>(iv) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting would permit the subject of a criminal investigation or other investigation conducted for law enforcement purposes to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(B) From subsection (d) because access to such records contained in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation or other investigation conducted for law enforcement purposes, of the existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(C) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal investigations or other law enforcement investigations, information is often obtained concerning the violations of laws or civil obligations of others not relating to an active case or matter. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary that this valuable information is retained because it can aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide valuable leads for other agencies and future cases that may be brought.</P>
              <P>(D) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (e)(4)(H) because the requirements in those subsections are inapplicable to the extent that portions of this system of records may be exempted from subsection (d), concerning individual access.</P>
              <P>(E) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific sources must be withheld to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</P>
              <P>(F) From subsection (f) because portions of this system of records have been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(G) For records that are copies of exempt records from external systems of records, such records are only exempt from pertinent provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a to the extent such provisions have been identified and an exemption claimed for the original record and the purposes underlying the exemption for the original record still pertain to the record that is now contained in this system of records. In general, the exemptions were claimed to properly protect classified information relating to national defense and foreign policy; to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative actions or investigations; to ensure protective services provided to the President and others are not compromised; to protect records used solely as statistical records; to protect the identity of confidential sources incident to Federal employment, military service, contract, and security clearance determinations; to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of Federal testing materials; and to safeguard evaluation materials used for military promotions when provided by a confidential source. The exemption rule for the original records will identify the specific reasons the records are exempt from specific provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Exempt OPM records.</E> Three Office of Personnel Management systems of records apply to Army employees, except for non-appropriated fund employees. These systems, the specific exemptions determined to be necessary and proper, the records exempted, provisions of the Privacy Act from which exempt, and justification are set forth below:</P>
              <P>(1) Personnel Investigations Records (OPM/CENTRAL-9).</P>
              <P>(i) Exemptions: (A) Information specifically authorized to be classified under E.O. 12958, as implemented by DoD 5200.1-R, may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).</P>
              <P>(B) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such information, the individual will be provided access to such information except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(C) Records maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C., section 3056 may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(3).</P>
              <P>(D) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>

              <P>(E) Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <PRTPAGE P="66"/>552a(k)(6), if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process.</P>
              <P>(F) Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(G) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (k)(2), (k)(3), (k)(5), (k)(6), or (k)(7) from subsections 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d).</P>
              <P>(ii) Reasons: (A) Personnel investigations may obtain from another Federal agency, properly classified information which pertains to national defense and foreign policy. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to an amendment of such classified information under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) in order to protect such information.</P>
              <P>(B) Personnel investigations may contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), e.g., investigations into the administration of the merit system. Application of exemption (k)(2) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to or amendment of such records, under 552a(c)(3) and (d) because otherwise, it would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(C) Personnel investigations may obtain from another Federal agency, information that relates to providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to section 3056 of title 18. Application of exemption (k)(3) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to or amendment of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) to ensure protective services provided to the President and others are not compromised.</P>
              <P>(D) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d) in order to protect the identity of confidential sources incident to determinations of suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal employment, military service, contract, and security clearance determinations.</P>
              <P>(E) All material and information in the records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of records by the data subject in order to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of Federal testing materials.</P>
              <P>(F) All material and information in the records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of records by the data subject in order to safeguard evaluation materials used for military promotions when furnished by a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(2) Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records (OPM/GOVT-5).</P>
              <P>(i) Exemptions: (A) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</P>
              <P>(B) Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process.</P>
              <P>(C) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), or (k)(6) from subsections 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d).</P>
              <P>(ii) Reasons: (A) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d) in order to protect the identity of confidential sources incident to determinations of suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal employment, military service, contract, and security clearance determinations. These exemptions are also claimed because this system contains investigative material compiled solely for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of a request for approval of an objection to an eligible individual's qualification for employment in the Federal service.</P>
              <P>(B) All material and information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) are exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access and amendment of records by the subject, in order to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of Federal testing materials.</P>
              <P>(3) Personnel Research Test Validation Records (OPM/GOVT-6).</P>

              <P>(i) Exemptions: Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) from subsections 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).<PRTPAGE P="67"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Reasons: All material and information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to an amendment of the records by the data subject, in order to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of Federal testing materials.</P>
              <P>(i) Twelve Exceptions to the “No Disclosure without Consent” rule of the Privacy Act.</P>
              <P>(1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1)—To DoD officers and employees who have a need for the record in the performance of their official duties. This is the “official need to know” concept.</P>

              <P>(6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(6)—To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record that has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the U.S. Government, or for evaluation by the Archivist of the United States or the designee of the Archivist to determine whether the record has such value. Note: Records transferred to the Federal Records Centers for storage remain under the control of the Department of the Army and no accounting for disclosure is required under the Privacy Act.</P>
              <P>(7) 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7)—To another agency or instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity, if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Department of the Army or DoD specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Access.</E> Review or copying a record or parts thereof contained in a Privacy Act system of records by an individual.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency.</E> For the purposes of disclosing records subject to the Privacy Act, Components of the Department of Defense are considered a single agency. For other purposes including access, amendment, appeals from denials of access or amendment, exempting systems of records, and recordkeeping for release to non-DOD agencies, the Department of the Army is considered its own agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment.</E> The process of adding, deleting, or changing information in a system of records to make the data accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Computer Matching Agreement.</E> An agreement to conduct a computerized comparison of two or more automated systems of records to verify eligibility for payments under Federal benefit programs or to recover delinquent debts for these programs.</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Deceased Individuals.</E> The Privacy Act confers no rights on deceased persons, nor may their next-of-kin exercise any rights for them.

This information may be withheld when necessary to protect the privacy interests of surviving family members. Even information that is not particularly sensitive in and of itself may be withheld to protect the privacy interests of surviving family members if disclosure would rekindle grief, anguish, pain, embarrassment, or cause a disruption of their peace minds. Because surviving family members use the deceased's Social Security Number to obtain benefits, DA personnel should continue to protect the SSN of deceased individuals.</P>

              <P>Chaplains will conduct or arrange for appropriate burial services at the interment of members of the military service, active and retired, and for members of their families upon request. A chaplain may perform the marriage rite, provided he complies with the civil law of the place where the marriage is to be solemnized and provided all parties concerned have complied with the requirements of the denomination the chaplain represents and with any directives which may have been issued by the military command or higher headquarters. The scope of the chaplains' work will include such ministrations as are held by some denominations or religious bodies as sacraments and by others as rites or ordinances. Chaplains will administer or arrange for rites and sacraments for military personnel and civilians under military jurisdiction according to the respective beliefs and conscientious practices of all concerned.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Service of civil process within the United States.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> DA officials will not prevent or evade the service or process in legal actions brought against the United States or against themselves in their official capacities. If acceptance of service of process would interfere with the performance of military duties, Army officials may designate a representative to accept service. DA personnel sued in their individual capacity should seek legal counsel concerning voluntary acceptance of process.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Process of Federal courts.</E> Subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander, civil officials will be permitted to serve Federal process. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, 45).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Process of state courts.</E> (1) In areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction that are not subject to the right to serve state process, the commander or supervisor will determine whether the individual to be served wishes to accept service voluntarily. A JA or other DA attorney will inform the individual of the legal effect of voluntary acceptance. If the individual does not desire to accept service, the party requesting service will be notified that the nature of the exclusive Federal jurisdiction precludes service by state authorities on the military installation.</P>
                <P>(2) On Federal property where the right to serve process is reserved by or granted to the state, in areas of concurrent jurisdiction, or where the United States has only a proprietary interest, Army officials asked to facilitate service of process will initially proceed as provided in the preceding subparagraph. If the individual declines to accept service, the requesting party will be allowed to serve the process in accordance with applicable state law, subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Process of foreign courts.</E> A U.S. District Court may order service upon a person who resides in the judicial district of any document issued in connection with a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal. (28 U.S.C. 1696). In addition, the U.S. State Department has the power to receive a letter rogatory issued by a foreign or international tribunal, to transmit it to a tribunal, officer or agency in the United States, and to return it after execution. (28 U.S.C. 1781). Absent a treaty or agreement to the contrary, these provisions will govern.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Seizure of personal property.</E> State and Federal courts issue orders (for example, writ of attachment) authorizing a levy (seizure) of property to secure satisfaction of a judgment. DA personnel will comply with valid state or Federal court orders commanding or authorizing the seizure of private property to the same extent that state or Federal process is served.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Injunctive relief.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Plaintiffs may attempt to force government action or restraint in important operational matters or pending personnel actions through motions for temporary restraining orders (TRO) or preliminary injunctions (PI). Because these actions can quickly impede military functions, immediate and decisive action must be taken.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification to HQDA and U.S. Attorney.</E> The SJA or legal adviser will immediately notify Litigation Division or other appropriate office at HQDA when a motion for TRO or PI has been, or is about to be, filed. The SJA or legal adviser will also notify the responsible U.S. Attorney.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Actions by SJA or legal adviser.</E> The SJA or legal adviser will assist the DOJ or DA attorney responsible for the litigation. Installation attorneys or support personnel should begin accumulating relevant documentary evidence and identifying witnesses. If requested, installation attorneys will prepare a legal memorandum concerning the motion, giving particular attention to the following issues relevant to a court granting injunctive relief:</P>
                <P>(1) Plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if injunctive relief is not granted.</P>
                <P>(3) Harm to defendant and other parties if injunctive relief is granted.</P>
                <P>(4) The public interest.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Habeas Corpus.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A soldier may file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his continued custody (usually in a post court-martial situation) or retention in the Army. As is the case with injunctive relief in the preceding paragraph, installation SJAs and legal advisers must take immediate action.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification to Litigation Division and U.S. Attorney.</E> The SJA or legal adviser will notify Litigation Division and the responsible U.S. Attorney's Office immediately upon learning that a petition for writ of habeas corpus has been filed. All relevant documentary evidence supporting the challenged action should be assembled immediately.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures in habeas corpus.</E> Upon the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the court will dismiss the petition, issue the writ, or order the respondent to show cause why it should not be granted. If a writ or order to show cause is issued, the SJA or legal adviser should be prepared to assist the responsible Litigation Division or DOJ attorney in preparing a return and answer. If so directed, the SJA will also prepare a memorandum of points and authorities to accompany the return and answer. The government's response should cover the following: whether the Army has custody of petitioner; whether respondent and petitioner are within the judicial district; and, whether appellate or administrative remedies have been exhausted.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Writs or orders issued by state courts.</E> No state court, after being judicially informed that a petitioner is in custody under the authority of the United States, should interfere with that custody or require that petitioner be brought before the state court. A deserter, apprehended by any civil officer having authority to apprehend offenders under the laws of the United States or of any state, district, territory, or possession of the United States, is in custody by authority of the United States. If a writ of habeas corpus is <PRTPAGE P="88"/>issued by a state court, the SJA or legal adviser will seek guidance from Litigation Division.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Foreign court orders.</E> A foreign court should not inquire into the legality of restraint of a person held by U.S. military authority. If a foreign court issues any process in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, the SJA or legal adviser will immediately report the matter to the appropriate U.S. forces commander and to Litigation Division.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Litigation against government contractors.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A contract might require that the government reimburse a contractor (or subcontractor) for adverse judgments or litigation expenses. Unless a contractor or subcontractor facing a lawsuit requests representation by DOJ, the Army presumes the contractor will obtain private counsel to defend the case. If the contract so allows, however, the contractor may request and HQDA may recommend that DOJ represent the contractor if it is in the best interests of the United States.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Actions by SJA or legal adviser.</E> If a contractor or subcontractor faces litigation and the underlying contract with the government requires reimbursement for adverse judgments or costs of the litigation, the SJA or legal adviser, through the contracting officer, should determine if the contractor desires representation by DOJ. If so, the contractor or authorized agent will sign a request for representation. (See figure D-3, appendix G, of this part.) The SJA or legal adviser will determine whether, in his opinion, representation by DOJ should be granted. He will prepare a memorandum to support his recommendation, especially concerning any issue regarding the government's obligation to reimburse the contractor under the contract. The SJA or legal adviser will forward his memorandum, along with the contractor's request, to Litigation Division.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Actions by Litigation Division.</E> The Chief, Litigation Division, will evaluate the submission and decide if it is in the Army's best interest that the request be granted. He will prepare a memorandum supporting his decision and send the packet to DOJ. The Chief's decision constitutes the final DA position on the matter. If DOJ grants the contractor's request, the Chief, Litigation Division, will ensure that the contractor is notified through the SJA or legal adviser and the contracting officer.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Private Counsel.</E> A contractor represented by DOJ may ask that private counsel assist the DOJ attorney in the litigation. The DOJ attorney will remain in control of the litigation, and the fees for private counsel will not be reimbursable except under unusual circumstances. The contractor must seek both DOJ and DA approval to employ private counsel when DOJ representation has been granted. Even if DOJ and DA grant authority to employ private counsel, the contracting officer will determine whether a contractor will be reimbursed under the contract for private counsel.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> The contractor, unless the contract specifies otherwise, will ultimately decide whether to compromise a suit. Reimbursement under the contract is determined by the contracting officer, with the advice of his attorney.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Communications, transportation, and utility services administrative proceedings.</E> Any contracting officer or other Army official responsible for the acquisition of communications, transportation, utilities (gas, electric, water and sewer), or military mail services, who becomes aware of any action or proceeding of interest to the Army, <PRTPAGE P="89"/>will promptly refer the matter to the SJA or legal adviser, who will take the actions prescribed in § 516.17 of this part. Examples of actions requiring referral follow: new or amended rates, regulations, or conditions of service; applications for authority to discontinue or initiate service; changes in electromagnetic patterns causing adverse communications interference; or, zoning proposals affecting historic or aesthetic preservation. In addition, the SJA or legal adviser will transmit the following to Regulatory Law Office:</P>

In other legal proceedings instituted in a foreign country, the SJA or legal adviser will take the actions prescribed in § 516.17 of this part.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Maritime claims.</E> Admiralty and maritime claims within the purview of Chapter 8, AR 27-20, which have been investigated and processed under AR 55-19 or other applicable regulations, will be referred to USARCS.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Army and Air Force Exchange Service litigation.</E> The SJA or legal adviser will send a copy of all documents relating to litigation against AAFES to General Counsel, AAFES, P.O. Box 660202, Dallas, TX 75266-0202.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Statement of Facts.</E> Include a complete statement of the facts upon which the action and any defense thereto are based. Where possible, support facts by reference to documents or witness statements. Include details of previous administrative actions, such as the filing and results of an administrative claim. If the action is predicated on the Federal Tort Claims Act, include a description of the plaintiff's relationship to the United States, its instrumentalities, or its contractors. Also include a statement whether an insurance company or other third party has an interest in the plaintiff's claim by subrogation or otherwise and whether there are additional claims related to the same incident.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Setoff or Counterclaim.</E> Discuss whether setoff or counterclaim exists. If so, highlight the supportive facts.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Responses to Pleadings.</E> Prepare a draft answer or other appropriate response to the pleadings. (See figure C-1, to this part). Discuss whether allegations of fact are well-founded. Refer to evidence that refutes factual allegations.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Memorandum of Law.</E> Include a brief statement of the applicable law with citations to legal authority. Discussions of local law, if applicable, should cover relevant issues such as measure of damages, scope of employment, effect of contributory negligence, or limitations upon death and survival actions. Do not unduly delay submission of a litigation report to prepare a comprehensive memorandum of law.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Potential witness information.</E> List each person having information relevant to the case and provide an office address and telephone number. If there is no objection, provide the individual's social security account number, home address, and telephone number. This is “core information” required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil Justice Reform). Finally, summarize the information or potential testimony that each person listed could provide.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> (1) Attach a copy of all relevant documents. This is “core information” required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil Justice Reform). Unless otherwise directed by HQDA, <PRTPAGE P="90"/>each exhibit should be tabbed and internally paginated. References to exhibits in the litigation report should be to page numbers of particular exhibits.</P>
                <P>(2) Copies of relevant reports of claims officers, investigating officers, boards or similar data should be attached, although such reports will not obviate the requirement for preparation of a complete litigation report.</P>
                <P>(3) Prepare an index of tabs and exhibits.</P>
                <P>(4) Where a relevant document has been released pursuant to a FOIA request, provide a copy of the response, or otherwise identify the requestor and the records released.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The DA Form 4 (See figure C-2, appendix G, of this part) is used to authenticate Army records or documents. Documents attached to a properly prepared and sealed DA Form 4 are self-authenticating. (See Fed. R. Evid. 902).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Preparation at the installation level.</E> A DA Form 4 need not be prepared until the trial attorney presenting the government's case identifies documents maintained at the installation level which he will need at trial. Once documents are identified, the custodian of the documents will execute his portion of the DA Form 4. (See figure C-2, appendix G, of this part). The custodian certifies that the documents attached to the DA Form 4 are true copies of official documents. Documents attached to each form should be generally identified; each document need not be mentioned specifically. Only the upper portion of the form should be executed at the local level.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Actions at HQDA.</E> Upon receipt of the DA Form 4 with documents attached thereto, HQDA will affix a ribbon and seal and deliver it to the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Chief, Litigation Division, procedures.</E> The Chief, Litigation Division, will review the report and evidence regarding representation and scope of employment and will determine whether certification and representation are appropriate. He will send his recommendation to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or office within DOJ. The Chief, Litigation Division, will notify the defendant of DOJ's decision.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Private counsel at government expense.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> DA personnel, sued in their individual capacity or facing criminal charges as a result of performance of official duties, have no right to employ a private sector counsel at government expense or to expect reimbursement for the same. For proceedings in the United States, a request for employment of counsel at government expense may be approved by DOJ, contingent among other things upon availability of funds and a determination that employment of private counsel at government expense is in the best interests of the United States. (See 28 CFR 50.16). Special rules apply in overseas areas. (See paragraph (e) of this section).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Individual request procedures.</E> The individual will prepare a request that private counsel be employed for him at government expense. The request must also contain the following statement: “I understand that the United States is not required to employ private counsel on my behalf, and that I may be responsible for expenses incurred prior to proper authorization by the Department of the Army or the Department of Justice.”</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Supervisory and legal adviser procedures.</E> The request will be submitted through the individual's supervisors, who will make a recommendation and forward the packet to the local SJA or legal adviser. The SJA or legal adviser will prepare his own recommendation and forward the matter to Litigation Division.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Chief, Litigation Division, procedures.</E> If the Chief, Litigation Division, determines that the request for private counsel is meritorious, he will prepare an appropriate recommendation and forward the packet to Civil Division, DOJ, for final approval.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Special actions in foreign countries.</E> Employment of private counsel in foreign proceedings is governed by AR 27-50 (Status of Forces Policies, Procedures, and Information). Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1037, soldiers, as well as employees or those accompanying the armed forces overseas, may be granted individual counsel in civil and criminal proceedings, under the criteria of AR 27-50.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Requests for indemnification.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> An individual liable for a judgment rendered against him in his <PRTPAGE P="93"/>individual capacity has no right to reimbursement from DA. DA will consider, however, a request for indemnification from DA personnel where conduct within the scope of official duties has resulted in personal liability and indemnification is in the best interests of the United States. Indemnification is strictly contingent upon an appropriation to pay the judgment, as well as availability of such funds.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Individual request procedures.</E> An individual against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered may request indemnification. The request must include, at a minimum, the following: how the employee was acting within the scope of his employment; whether the requestor has insurance or any other source of indemnification; and, how reimbursement is in the best interests of the United States. The request must also contain the following statements: “I understand that acceptance of this request for indemnification for processing by DA does not constitute an acceptance of any obligation to make such a payment. I also understand that payment is contingent on availability of funds and that it will only be made if such is determined to be in the best interests of the United States.” The individual should attach a copy of relevant documents, for example, court's opinion, judgment, and other allied papers.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Supervisory and SJA procedures.</E> The request for indemnification will be submitted through supervisory channels to the local SJA or legal adviser. Each supervisor will make a recommendation on the propriety of reimbursement.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Chief, Litigation Division, procedures.</E> Requests for indemnification will be forwarded to Chief, Litigation Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will examine the submission and, after consultation with DOJ or other agencies, forward the packet with his recommendation to the Army General Counsel. The General Counsel will obtain a final decision by the Secretary of the Army or his designee on the matter. There is no administrative appeal of the Secretary's (or his designee's) decision.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authorities.</E> (1) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651). The act provides for the recovery of medical care expenses incurred because of a tortfeasor's actions.</P>
                <P>(2) Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711). The act provides for the collection of claims for money or property arising from the activities of Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(3) Third-party Collection Program (10 U.S.C. 1095). The statute provides for collection of reasonable costs of health-care services, provided in facilities of the uniformed services to covered beneficiaries, from private insurers or third-party payers. In accordance with DOD Instruction 6010.15, “Third Party Collection (TPC) Program,” 7 March 1991, the authority to settle or waive a DOD claim under the act is delegated to TJAG or to his designee.</P>
                <P>(4) Executive Order No. 12778, (56 FR 55195; 3 CFR, 1991 Comp. p. 359), Civil Justice Reform. This order establishes several requirements on Federal agencies involved in litigation or contemplating filing an action on behalf of the United States.</P>
                <P>(5) AR 27-20, Claims. Chapter l4 (Affirmative Claims) contains comprehensive guidance for Recovery Judge Advocates (RJAs) in the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement, and waiver of claims in favor of the U.S. for property damage and for medical care claims.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Duties and procedures.</E> In accordance with Chapter 14, AR 27-20, Commander, USARCS, has supervisory responsibility over the administrative processing of property and medical care claims by RJAs. The Commander, U.S. Army Health Services Command (HSC), has supervisory responsibility over the Third Party Collection Program (TPCP). The HSC TPCP Implementation Plan effects DOD Instruction 6010.15 and establishes procedures for processing TPC claims. Litigation Division, in conjunction with DOJ and <PRTPAGE P="94"/>U.S. Attorneys, is responsible for pursuing, through litigation, claims not resolved administratively. DOJ is ultimately responsible for initiating litigation for the United States. (28 U.S.C. 515).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Assertion of claims on behalf of the United States by private attorneys.</E> The Army incurs potentially recoverable expenses when it provides medical care to soldiers or dependents injured by tortfeasors (for example, a soldier is hospitalized after an automobile accident). When injured personnel employ a private attorney to sue the tortfeasor, it may be in the Government's best interests to enter into an agreement with the private attorney to include the Army's medical care claim.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Statute of limitations.</E> There is a three year statute of limitations for actions in favor of the U.S. for money damages founded upon tort. (28 U.S.C. 2415(b)). Limitations periods can vary, however, depending upon the theory of liability and the jurisdiction involved. RJAs must be alert to the applicable period of limitations. A case referred for litigation should arrive at Litigation Division at least 6 months before the expiration of the limitations period.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Reporting of recoveries.</E> Amounts recovered through litigation will be reported to USARCS by Tort Branch, Litigation Division, or, where referred directly to a U.S. Attorney or the Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF), by the responsible RJA.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria for referral.</E> The RJA will forward the claims file and a litigation report (See § 516.35 of this part) through USARCS to Litigation Division when the claim has not been resolved administratively and any of the following conditions exist:</P>
                <P>(1) The claim exceeds $5,000;</P>
                <P>(2) It involves collection from the injured party or his attorney;</P>
                <P>(3) The claim raises an important question of policy; or,</P>
                <P>(4) There is potential for a significant precedent.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternative methods.</E> When none of the conditions cited in the preceding subparagraph are present, the RJA may refer the claim directly to the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the prospective defendant resides. Similar property claims may be referred through USARCS to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF) rather than directly to the U.S. Attorney. Notice of all such referrals shall be provided through USARCS to Tort Branch, Litigation Division. The RJA should be ready to provide support to the U.S. Attorney if requested.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Closing files.</E> A file referred directly to the U.S. Attorney will be closed if the U.S. Attorney determines further action is unwarranted. If the RJA disagrees, the file should be forwarded with the RJA's recommendation through USARCS to Litigation Division.</P>

                <P>(1) A litigation report (See § 516.23 of this part) that demonstrates a factual basis for the claim and a theory of recovery under applicable state law. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11)</P>
                <P>(2) Copies of all medical records and bills reflecting the reasonable value of the medical care furnished to the injured party, including DA Form 2631-R (Medical Care-Third Party Liability Notification), and DA Form 3154 (MSA Invoice and Receipt). These documents should be authenticated as necessary on a DA Form 4.</P>
                <P>(3) Copies of all documents necessary to establish the value of lost or damaged property.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Transmittal letter.</E> The letter of transmittal referring the claim for litigation should briefly summarize the facts giving rise to the claim and the collection actions previously taken by the Army and the injured party.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> When eviction or an action to collect delinquent rent is necessary, the SJA or legal adviser will notify General Litigation Branch, Litigation Division, of the situation. If approved by Litigation Division, the SJA or legal adviser may ask the U.S. Attorney to file suit. A copy of the complaint will be sent to Litigation Division. DOJ can take action to evict the occupants for violation of the terms of occupancy and collect delinquent rent or other charges. Once the matter has been referred to the U.S. Attorney, payments for rent should be sent to the U.S. Attorney. (See AR 210-50, chap 2.)</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> This subpart implements DOD Directive 5405.2 (See appendix C to this part and 32 CFR part 97). It governs the release of official information and the appearance of present and former DA personnel as witnesses in response to requests for interviews, notices of depositions, subpoenas, and other requests or orders related to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Requests for records, if not in the nature of legal process, should be processed under AR 25-55 (The Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program) or AR 340-21 (The Army Privacy Program). This subpart pertains to any request for witnesses, documents, or information for all types of litigation, including requests by private litigants, requests by State or U.S. attorneys, requests by foreign officials or tribunals, subpoenas for records or testimony, notices of depositions, interview requests, civil cases, criminal proceedings, private litigation, or litigation in which the United States has an interest.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General Rule.</E> Except as authorized by this subpart, present or former DA personnel will not disclose official information (See appendix F—Glossary) <PRTPAGE P="97"/>in response to subpoenas, court orders, or requests.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Present or former DA personnel may disclose official information if they obtain the written approval of the appropriate SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Referral to deciding official.</E> If present or former DA personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or request for an interview related to actual or potential litigation, and it appears the subpoena, order, or request seeks disclosures described in a above, the individual should immediately advise the appropriate SJA or legal adviser. If the SJA or legal adviser cannot informally satisfy the subpoena, order, or request in accordance with §§ 516.43 through 516.50 of this subpart, he should consult with Litigation Division.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Requesters' responsibilities.</E> Individuals seeking official information must submit, at least 14 days before the desired date of production, a specific written request setting forth the nature and relevance of the official information sought. (Requesters can be referred to this subpart G). Subject to § 516.47(a), present and former DA personnel may only produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters specified in writing and properly approved by the SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Litigation in which the United States has an interest.</E> If a subpoena, order, or request relates to litigation in which the United States has an interest and for which litigation responsibility has not been delegated, the SJA or legal adviser will coordinate with Litigation Division under § 516.42.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Motions to stay or quash subpoenas.</E> A subpoena should never be ignored, and an SJA or legal adviser should seek assistance from Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney's office whenever necessary. If a response to a subpoena or order is required before a release determination can be made or before Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney can be contacted, the SJA or legal adviser will do the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Furnish the court or tribunal a copy of this regulation (32 CFR part 516, subpart G) and applicable case law (See United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951));</P>
                <P>(2) Inform the court or tribunal that the requesting individual has not complied with this Chapter, as set out in 32 CFR 97 &amp; 516, or that the subpoena or order is being reviewed;</P>
                <P>(3) Seek to stay the subpoena or order pending the requestor's compliance with this chapter or final determination by Litigation Division; and,</P>
                <P>(4) If the court or other tribunal declines to quash or stay the subpoena or order, inform Litigation Division immediately so a decision can be made whether to challenge the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides not to challenge the subpoena or order, the affected personnel will comply with the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides to challenge the subpoena or order, it will direct the affected personnel to respectfully decline to comply with the subpoena or order. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)).</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Classified or sensitive information.</E> Only Litigation Division may authorize the release of official information or appearance of DA personnel as witnesses in litigation involving terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, or intelligence sources and methods.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Requests for Inspector General records or testimony.</E> IG records, and information obtained through performance of IG duties, are official information under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Army. (See AR 20-l, Chapter 3.) IG records frequently contain sensitive official information that may be classified or obtained under guarantees of confidentiality. When justification exists, DA attorneys will seek court protection from disclosure of IG records and information. No DA personnel will release IG records or disclose information obtained through performance of IG duties without the approval of The Secretary of the Army, The Inspector General, TIG Legal Advisor, or Chief, Litigation Division. When IG personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or a request for an interview which the IG <PRTPAGE P="98"/>reasonably believes is related to actual or potential litigation concerning IG records or related information, they should immediately notify the Inspector General Legal Adviser or the Chief, Litigation Division. IG personnel will follow the guidance of this subpart concerning actions to be taken regarding disclosure and testimony.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Preservation of originals.</E> To preserve the integrity of DA records, DA personnel will submit properly authenticated copies rather than originals of documents or records for use in legal proceedings, unless directed otherwise by Litigation Division. (See 28 U.S.C. 1733.)</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Authentication of copies.</E> Copies of DA records approved for release can be authenticated for introduction in evidence by use of DA Form 4. (See § 516.25 for instructions.)</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> DA policy is to make official information reasonably available for use in Federal and state courts and by other governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Releasability factors.</E> In deciding whether to authorize release of official information, the deciding official should consider the following:</P>
                  <P>(1) Has the requester complied with DA policy governing the release of official documents in § 516.41(d) of this part.</P>
                  <P>(2) Is the request unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules?</P>

                  <P>(4) Would the disclosure violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive?</P>
                  <P>(5) Is the disclosure appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege?</P>
                  <P>(6) Would the disclosure reveal information properly classified pursuant to the DOD Information Security Program under AR 380-5, unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to 32 CFR § 250, or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure?</P>
                  <P>(7) Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information, or, otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances?</P>
                  <P>(8) Would the disclosure violate any person's expectation of confidentiality or privacy?</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Records determined to be releasable.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>If the deciding official, after considering the factors set forth in § 536.44, determines that all or part of requested official records are releasable, copies of the records should be furnished to the requester.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Records determined not to be releasable.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If the deciding official, after considering the factors in § 516.44, determines that all or part of requested official records should not be released, he will promptly communicate directly with the attorney or individual who caused the issuance of the subpoena, order, or request and seek to resolve the matter informally. If the subpoena or order is invalid, he should explain the basis of the invalidity. The deciding official should also explain why the records requested are privileged from release. The deciding official should attempt to obtain the agreement of the requester to withdraw the subpoena, order, or request or to modify the subpoena, order, or request so that it pertains only to records which may be released. (See figure G-1, appendix G, of this part.)</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Information protected by the Privacy Act.</E> (1) A subpoena duces tecum or other legal process signed by an attorney or clerk of court for records protected by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, does not justify the release of the protected records. The deciding official should explain to the requester that the Privacy Act precludes disclosure of records in a system of records without the written consent of the subject of the records or “pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.” (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11)). An “order of the court” for the purpose of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11) is an order or writ requiring the production of the records, signed by a judge or magistrate.</P>

                  <P>(2) Unclassified records otherwise privileged from release under 5 U.S.C. 552a may be released to the court under either of the following conditions:<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(i) The subpoena is accompanied by an order signed by a judge or magistrate, or such order is separately served, that orders the person to whom the records pertain to release the specific records, or that orders copies of the records be delivered to the clerk of court, and indicates that the court has determined the materiality of the records and the nonavailability of a claim of privilege.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The clerk of the court is empowered by local statute or practice to receive the records under seal subject to request that they be withheld from the parties until the court determines whether the records are material to the issues and until any question of privilege is resolved.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Subpoenas for alcohol abuse or drug abuse treatment records must be processed under 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3 and 290ee-3, and Public Health Service regulations published at 42 CFR 2.1-2.67.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Upon request, SJAs and legal advisers may furnish to the attorney for the injured party or the tortfeasor's attorney or insurance company a copy of the narrative summary of medical care that relates to a claim under subpart E of this part. If additional medical records are requested, only those that directly pertain to the pending action will be furnished. If furnishing copies of medical records would prejudice the cause of action, the matter will be reported to Litigation Division.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Referral to Litigation Division.</E> If the SJA or legal adviser is not able to resolve a request for Army records informally, he should contact Litigation Division.</P>
                  <P>(1) Litigation Division may respond to subpoenas or orders for records privileged from release by informing the local U.S. Attorney about the subpoena and requesting that office file a motion to quash the subpoena or a motion for a protective order. The records privileged from release should be retained by the custodian pending the court's ruling upon the government's motion.</P>
                  <P>(2) When a motion to quash or for a protective order is not filed, or the motion is unsuccessful, and the appropriate DA official has determined that no further efforts will be made to protect the records, copies of the records (authenticated if necessary) will be submitted to the court (or to the clerk of court) in response to the subpoena or order.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Classified and privileged materials.</E> Requests from DOJ, U.S. Attorneys, or attorneys for other governmental entities for records which are classified or otherwise privileged from release will be referred to Litigation Division. (See § 516.41(g).</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> The involvement of present or former DA personnel in private litigation is solely a personal matter between the witness and the requesting party, unless one or more of the following conditions apply:</P>
                  <P>(1) The testimony involves official information. (See appendix F—Glossary to this part).</P>
                  <P>(2) The witness is to testify as an expert.</P>
                  <P>(3) The absence of the witness from duty will seriously interfere with the accomplishment of a military mission.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Former DA personnel.</E> Former DA personnel may freely respond to requests for interviews and subpoenas except in instances involving official information (paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or concerning expert testimony prohibited by § 516.49. In those instances, the subject of the request or subpoena should take the action specified in §§ 516.41(c) and 516.42.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Present DA personnel.</E> Present DA personnel will refer all requests for interviews and subpoenas for testimony in private litigation through their supervisor to the appropriate SJA or legal adviser.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Discretion to testify.</E> Any individual not wishing to grant an interview or to testify concerning private litigation may seek the advice of an Army attorney concerning the consequences, if any, of refusal. Any individual not authorized to consult with Army counsel should consult with private counsel, at no expense to the government.</P>

                  <P>(a) In instances involving § 516.47(a)(1), the matter will be referred <PRTPAGE P="101"/>to the SJA or legal adviser serving the organization of the individual whose testimony is requested, or to HQDA pursuant to § 516.47(a). The deciding official will determine whether to release the information sought under the principles established in § 516.44. If funding by the United States is requested, see § 516.55(d).</P>
                  <P>(b) If the deciding official determines that the information may be released, the individual will be permitted to be interviewed, deposed, or to appear as a witness in court provided such interview or appearance is consistent with the requirements of §§ 516.49 and 516.50. (See, for example, figure G-2, appendix G, to this part). A JA or DA civilian attorney should be present during any interview or testimony to act as legal representative of the Army. If a question seeks information not previously authorized for release, the legal representative will advise the witness not to answer. If necessary to avoid release of the information, the legal representative will advise the witness to terminate the interview or deposition, or in the case of testimony in court, advise the judge that DOD directives and Army regulations preclude the witness from answering without HQDA approval. Every effort should be made, however, to substitute releasable information and to continue the interview or testimony.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Present DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United States has an interest for a party other than the United States. Former DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects, or activities either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United States has an interest for a party other than the United States. (See figure G-3, appendix G of this part). An SJA or legal adviser is authorized to deny a request for expert testimony, which decision may be appealed to Litigation Division.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception to the general prohibition.</E> If a requester can show exceptional need or unique circumstances, and the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the United States, Litigation Division may grant special written authorization for present or former DA personnel to testify as expert or opinion witnesses at no expense to the United States. In no event may present or former DA personnel furnish expert or opinion testimony in a case in which the United States has an interest for a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the United States.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Exception for AMEDD personnel.</E> Members of the Army medical department or other qualified specialists may testify in private litigation with the following limitations (See figure G-4, appendix G, of this part):</P>
                  <P>(1) The litigation involves patients they have treated, investigations they have made, laboratory tests they have conducted, or other actions taken in the regular course of their duties.</P>
                  <P>(2) They limit their testimony to factual matters such as the following: their observations of the patient or other operative facts; the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken; course of recovery or steps required for repair of damage suffered; and, contemplated future treatment.</P>
                  <P>(3) Their testimony may not extend to expert or opinion testimony, to hypothetical questions, or to a prognosis.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Court-ordered expert or opinion testimony.</E> If a court or other appropriate authority orders expert or opinion testimony, the witness will immediately notify Litigation Division. If Litigation Division determines it will not challenge the subpoena or order, the witness will comply with the subpoena or order. If directed by Litigation Division, however, the witness will respectfully decline to comply with the subpoena or order. (See <E T="03">United States ex. rel. Touhy</E> v. <E T="03">Ragen,</E> 340 U.S. 462 (1951)).</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Witnesses for the United States.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Status of witness.</E> A military member authorized to appear as a witness for the United States, including those authorized to appear under § 516.55(d), will be placed on temporary duty. If USAR or NG personnel are requested as witnesses for the United States, and if their testimony arises from their active duty service, they should be placed on active duty to testify. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under Federal Personnel Manual 630, subchapter 10. DA personnel who appear as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government's claim for medical care expenses are witnesses for the United States.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Travel arrangements.</E> Travel arrangements for witnesses for the United States normally are made by DOJ through Litigation Division for other than local travel. Litigation Division will issue instructions for this travel, including fund citation, to the appropriate commander. A U.S. Attorney, or an attorney asserting the government's medical care claim under subpart E, may make arrangements for local travel through the SJA or legal adviser for attendance of a witness who is stationed at an installation within the same judicial district, or not more than 100 miles from the place where testifying. Other requests, including those under § 516.55(d), will be referred <PRTPAGE P="103"/>to Litigation Division. The instructions from Litigation Division, or the request from the U.S. Attorney or the attorney asserting the government's claim, will serve as a basis for the issuance of appropriate travel orders by the local commander.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Travel and per diem expenses.</E> The witness' commander or supervisor should ensure the witness has sufficient funds to defray expenses. The SJA or legal adviser will provide assistance.</P>
                  <P>(1) Where local travel is performed at the request of a U.S. Attorney and the testimony does not involve information acquired in the performance of duties, transportation arrangements and any per diem expenses are the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney.</P>
                  <P>(2) An attorney asserting the government's medical care or property claim may be required to advance local travel expense money to the witness requested and to include these in recoverable costs where the government's claim is not large enough to justify expenditures of government travel funds.</P>
                  <P>(3) Other local travel and per diem expense for cases involving Army activities or claims are proper expenses of the command issuing the orders.</P>
                  <P>(4) Litigation Division will furnish travel expense and per diem funds for other than local travel and will receive reimbursement from DOJ or other government agencies as appropriate.</P>

If authorized to appear as a witness, but the testimony does not relate to information obtained in the performance of official duties, a military member may be granted a pass or permissive TDY under AR 630-5, or be required to take ordinary leave.

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Travel expenses.</E> The United States may not pay travel, meals, and lodging expenses of the witness, other than normal allowances for subsistence pursuant to the DOD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual. These expenses are solely a matter between the witness and the party seeking his appearance. Witnesses ordinarily should be advised to require advance payment of such expenses. Military personnel authorized to appear in a pass or permissive TDY status are not entitled to receive witness attendance fees, but may accept travel, meals, and lodging expense money from the requesting litigant. All witness fees tendered the military member, to the extent they exceed such actual expenses of the member, will be remitted to the Treasurer of the United States. A civilian employee authorized to appear in his or her official capacity will accept the authorized witness fees, in addition to the allowance for travel and subsistence, and make disposition of the witness fees as instructed by his or her personnel office.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Funding by the United States.</E> Requests for DA personnel to appear at government expense as witnesses in state or local proceedings for a party other than the United States, including cases involving domestic violence or child abuse, will be referred to Litigation Division. Litigation Division may authorize travel and per diem expenses under § 516.54 when the case is one in which the United States has a significant interest.</P>

              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 516.58</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Policies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Procurement fraud and irregularities will be promptly and thoroughly addressed whenever encountered. Reports will be initiated in a timely manner and will be supplemented as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) Investigations will be monitored to see that interim corrective action is taken and that final action is taken as expeditiously as possible.</P>
                <P>(c) This regulation establishes the Procurement Fraud Division (PFD), U.S. Army Legal Services Agency, as the single centralized organization within the Army to coordinate and monitor criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative remedies in significant cases of fraud or corruption relating to Army procurement.</P>
                <P>(d) The key elements of the Army's procurement fraud program follow: centralized policy making and program direction; fraud remedies coordination; decentralized responsibility for operational matters, such as reporting and remedial action; continuous case monitorship by PFD from the initial report until final disposition; and, command-wide fraud awareness training.</P>
                <P>(e) Remedies for PFI will be pursued in a timely manner and properly coordinated with other agencies. Every effort will be made to support criminal investigation and prosecution of fraudulent activity.</P>
                <P>(f) A specific remedies plan will be formulated for each significant case of fraud or corruption involving procurement.</P>
                <P>(g) Coordination on the status and disposition of cases will be maintained between PFD, OTJAG, PFI Coordinators at MACOMs, and Procurement Fraud Advisers at subordinate commands. Coordination of procurement and personnel actions will be accomplished with investigative agencies as required by those agencies.</P>
                <P>(h) Training which relates to fraud and corruption in the procurement process is a significant element of this program.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Duties and procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) TJAG has overall responsibility for the coordination of remedies in procurement fraud and corruption within the Army. This responsibility has been delegated to PFD. Functions of PFD will include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Serving as the single centralized organization in the Army to monitor the status of, and ensure the coordination of, criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative remedies for each significant case of fraud or corruption.</P>

                <P>(2) Receiving reports of procurement fraud and corruption from any source <PRTPAGE P="105"/>including, but not limited to the following: DOD criminal investigative organizations; audit agencies; contracting officers; inspectors general of the executive branch; correspondence from the public; and, commanders. This provision does not repeal any other reporting requirement but establishes PFD as a recipient of PFI information at the earliest possible time.</P>
                <P>(3) Establishing a monitoring system within OTJAG for all cases of fraud and corruption that relate to Army procurement.</P>
                <P>(4) Discussing regularly with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) or the assigned DOD criminal investigative organization the current status of significant fraud or corruption cases and their coordination with prosecutive authorities.</P>
                <P>(5) Ensuring that all criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative remedies are considered in each significant fraud or corruption case and that timely and applicable remedies are undertaken by commanders, contracting officers, and suspension and debarment authorities. For example, consideration of suspension or debarment of a contractor or individual should normally be initiated within 30 days of indictment or conviction.</P>
                <P>(6) Coordinating, as appropriate, with other DOD components affected by a significant fraud or corruption case being monitored by the Army.</P>
                <P>(7) Developing, with the responsible DOD investigative organization, Procurement Fraud Coordinators and Advisers, and other involved agencies, a specific comprehensive remedies plan for each significant fraud or corruption case.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Coordinating remedies with DOJ.</E> In the case of ongoing criminal investigations, coordinate remedies through, or with the prior knowledge of, the DOD criminal investigative organization responsible for the case.</P>
                <P>(9) In significant fraud or corruption cases, identifying and documenting any known adverse impact on a DOD mission, and including the information in any remedies plan.</P>
                <P>(10) Providing the appropriate DOD criminal investigative organization with information concerning final remedies as a result of an investigation by that organization.</P>
                <P>(11) Receiving notifications from criminal investigative agencies concerning substituted, defective, and counterfeit hardware in which a serious hazard to health, safety or operational readiness is indicated; ensuring that appropriate safety, procurement and program officials are informed in accordance with enclosure 3 of DOD Directive 7050.5. PFD will specifically ensure that contract reviews (DD 350 reports) and adverse impact statements (See § 516.64(c)(2) are prepared, and that such information is used to determine if further inquiry is warranted to prevent reoccurrence and to detect other possible fraud. Impact statements will not be released to prosecutive agencies until reviewed by PFD. When appropriate, PFD will coordinate with other DOD agencies to establish a lead agency for victim impact statements in multi-DOD agency cases.</P>
                <P>(b) The Commanding General, USACIDC, will take the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) Notify PFD of any investigations involving fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.</P>
                <P>(2) Notify other DOD component criminal investigative organizations when investigations involving fraud or corruption affect that component. This includes evidence of fraud by a contractor, subcontractor, or employee of either, on current or past contracts with, or affecting, that component.</P>
                <P>(3) Notify the Defense Investigative Service of any investigations that develop evidence which affects DOD cleared industrial facilities or personnel.</P>
                <P>(4) Determine the effect on any ongoing investigations or prosecutions of any criminal, civil, contractual, or administrative actions being considered by a centralized organization and advise of any adverse impact.</P>

                <P>(5) Promptly provide commanders, contracting officers, Procurement Fraud Advisers, and suspension and debarment authorities, when needed to allow consideration of applicable remedies, any court records, documents, or other evidence of fraud or corruption from ongoing or completed criminal investigations. In cases of indictment or <PRTPAGE P="106"/>conviction of a contractor or individual, the information will be provided in time for initiation, if appropriate, of suspension or debarment action within 30 days of the indictment or conviction.</P>
                <P>(6) Provide prosecutive authorities and centralized organizations with timely information on the adverse impact on a DOD mission of fraud or corruption that relates to DOD procurement activities. This information will be obtained from individuals such as the head of the contracting agency, appropriate commanders, and staff agencies. Some examples of adverse impact on a DOD mission are endangerment of personnel or property, monetary loss, compromise of the procurement process, or reduction or loss of mission readiness.</P>
                <P>(7) Discuss regularly with Procurement Fraud Advisers the status of significant investigations of fraud or corruption and their coordination with prosecutive authorities and provide documents and reports resulting from the investigations.</P>
                <P>(c) Commanders of service schools conducting procurement or procurement-related training (such as The Judge Advocate General's School, the U.S. Military Police School, and the U.S. Army Logistics Management Center) will ensure the following:</P>
                <P>(1) All procurement and procurement-related training includes a period of instruction on fraud and corruption in the procurement process. The length of the period of instruction will be appropriate to the duration and nature of the training.</P>
                <P>(2) Training materials are developed to support that training.</P>
                <P>(3) Training materials developed will be sent to MACOM PFI Coordinators.</P>
                <P>(d) MACOM commanders and heads of contracting activities will ensure the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Substantial indications of fraud or corruption relating to Army contracts or Army administered contracts are reported promptly to the supporting USACIDC element and the Procurement Fraud Division.</P>
                <P>(2) Information provided includes reports by contracting officers under DFARS 209.406-3.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procurement fraud and irregularities programs at MACOMs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Command counsel and SJAs at MACOMs will develop a program and appoint an attorney as PFI Coordinator for their command. Chief counsel and SJAs at commands with procurement advisory responsibility will appoint an attorney as a Procurement Fraud Adviser (PFA) to manage the PFI program at their installations as well.</P>
                <P>(b) Provision may be made for activities not having sufficient attorney assets to obtain assistance from nearby installations that have a PFA.</P>
                <P>(c) Reports and recommendations will be transmitted through command channels to the PFI coordinator for the affected MACOM.</P>
                <P>(d) Command counsel, chief counsel, and SJAs will exercise supervisory authority to ensure effective operation of the fraud program and coordination of remedies within their organizations.</P>
                <P>(e) The MACOM PFI Coordinator will have overall responsibility for the design and implementation of the MACOM's procurement fraud program.</P>
                <P>(f) PFAs and PFI Coordinators will coordinate with the appropriate local CID or Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) activity to assure the prompt notification and coordination of all Procurement Fraud cases.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 516.61</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Reporting requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Typical fraud indicators during the procurement cycle are listed in figure D-1, appendix G, to this part. The mere presence of one or more of these indicators does not, by itself, require reporting under paragraph b of this section. Reports should be submitted if there is a reasonable suspicion of procurement fraud or irregularity or the procuring agency refers the matter for investigation.</P>
                <P>(b) “Procurement Flash Reports” will be transmitted by FAX directly to PFD whenever a PFI Coordinator or PFA receives notice of a PFI involving the Army. To facilitate filing, a separate sheet should be used for each case reported. These reports will provide a succinct summary of the following available information:</P>
                <P>(1) Name and address of contractor.<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Known subsidiaries of parent firms.</P>
                <P>(3) Contracts involved in potential fraud.</P>
                <P>(4) Nature of potential fraud.</P>

                <P>(6) Possible damages.</P>
                <P>(7) Investigative agencies involved.</P>
                <P>(8) Local PFAs (name and phone numbers).</P>
                <FP>Any of the above categories that cannot be completed will be annotated as “unknown at present.”</FP>
                <P>(c) When a report is required by DFARS or is requested by PFD, the provisions of DFARS 209.406-3 (48 CFR 209.406-3) will be followed. That paragraph provides the basic content and format for PFI reports.</P>
                <P>(d) All personnel will cooperate to ensure that investigations and prosecutions of procurement fraud are completed in a timely and thorough manner. Requests for assistance from federal prosecutors should be processed through the local PFA whenever possible. Requests for federal investigators will be processed through the supporting USACIDC and the PFA will be notified. When the conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions conflict with the progress of procurements, reasonable deference will be given to criminal investigators and prosecutors whenever possible. Any serious conflict that cannot be resolved at a local level will be immediately reported to the PFI Coordinator or PFD for action.</P>
                <P>(e) PFI Coordinators and PFAs may request access to information obtained during criminal investigations that is not protected by Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) and use this information to assist them in taking appropriate administrative, contractual, and civil remedies. Requests for this information should be made directly to the appropriate federal investigative agency. The investigative organization may withhold requested information if release would compromise an investigation. Difficulties in obtaining information which cannot be resolved locally will be referred to PFD for appropriate action.</P>
                <P>(f) USACIDC will notify, in writing, local PFAs as well as PFD within 30 days, of initiation of a significant investigation of fraud or corruption related to Army procurement activities. Such notification will include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Case title.</P>
                <P>(2) USACIDC Report of Investigation number.</P>
                <P>(3) Responsible investigative agency or agencies.</P>
                <P>(4) Office of primary responsibility.</P>
                <P>(5) Date opened.</P>
                <P>(6) Summary of facts.</P>
                <P>(7) Suspected offense.</P>
                <P>(g) The transmission of the information in f above may be delayed if the Commanding General, USACIDC, or the head of another DOD criminal investigation organization determines the transmission would compromise the success of any case or its prosecution. The prosecutive authorities dealing with the case will be consulted, when appropriate, in making such determinations.</P>
                <P>(h) USACIDC will obtain the following information at the earliest possible point in an investigation of fraud or corruption that relates to DOD procurement activities, whenever possible without reliance on grand jury subpoenas:</P>
                <P>(1) The individuals suspected to be responsible.</P>
                <P>(2) The suspected firm's organizational structure.</P>
                <P>(3) The firm's financial and contract history.</P>
                <P>(4) The firm's organizational documents and records.</P>
                <P>(5) Statements of witnesses.</P>
                <P>(6) Monetary loss to the government.</P>
                <P>(7) Other relevant information.</P>
                <P>This information will be provided to PFD or other cognizant DOD centralized organization.</P>
                <P>(i) PFD will provide written notification to the Defense Investigative Service of all suspension or debarment actions taken by the Army.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Coordination with DOJ.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) PFD will establish and maintain liaison with DOJ and the Defense Procurement Fraud Unit on significant fraud and corruption cases to accomplish the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Monitor criminal prosecutions.</P>
                <P>(2) Initiate litigation for civil recovery.</P>
                <P>(3) Coordinate administrative or contractual actions while criminal or civil proceedings are pending.</P>

                <P>(5) Respond to DOJ requests for information and assistance.</P>
                <P>(b) In cases where there is an ongoing criminal investigation, coordination with DOJ by any member of the Army normally will be accomplished by or through USACIDC or the cognizant DOD criminal investigative organization, or with the investigative organization's advance knowledge. This does not apply to the routine exchange of information between government attorneys in the course of civil litigation or the routine referral of cases to DOJ for civil recovery.</P>
                <P>(c) Initial contact by any attorney associated with the U.S. Army with a U.S. Attorney's office or DOJ, whether initiated by the Army attorney or not, will be reported to PFD. Activity after the initial contact will only be reported to PFD when the Army attorney feels there has been a significant event in the case. If the Army attorney is not a PFI Coordinator or a PFA, the matter should be referred to one of these two attorneys as soon as possible. Routine exchanges between Army attorneys and U.S. Attorney's offices or DOJ do not need to be brought to the attention of PFD.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Comprehensive remedies plan.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A specific, comprehensive remedies plan will be developed in each significant investigation involving fraud or corruption that relates to Army procurement activities. When possible, these plans should be forwarded with the DFARS 209.406-3 reports. In no case, however, should the report be delayed an appreciable time pending completion of the plan. The format for a remedies plan is at figure H-2, appendix G, to this part.</P>
                <P>(b) The plan will be developed initially by the PFA with the participation of the appropriate criminal investigators and other relevant personnel such as the contracting officer. In significant cases the PFA should also coordinate a remedies plan early with PFD. Defective product/product substitution remedies plans must comply with the requirements of appendix D to this part.</P>
                <P>(c) A comprehensive remedies plan will include at a minimum the following information and considerations:</P>
                <P>(1) Summary of allegations and investigative results.</P>
                <P>(2) Statement of any adverse impact on a DOD mission. DOD investigative organizations, commanders, or procurement officials will also provide this information to prosecutive authorities to enhance prosecution of offenses or to prepare a victim impact statement pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(2).</P>
                <P>(3) The impact upon combat readiness and safety.</P>

                <P>(4) Consideration of each criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative remedy available, and documentation of those remedies, either planned, in progress, or completed.<PRTPAGE P="109"/>

                <SUBJECT>Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA).</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) PFCRA was enacted on 21 October 1986 (Public Law 99-509) and implemented by DOD on 30 August 1988 (DOD Directive 5505.5). (See appendix E to this part.)</P>
                <P>(b) PFCRA expands the capability of the government to deter and recover losses from false, fictitious or fraudulent claims and statements. It is also applicable to program fraud and provides an administrative remedy in addition to those otherwise available to the Army in procurement fraud or pay and entitlements fraud cases.</P>
                <P>(c) As part of the Army implementation, the Secretary of the Army's duties and responsibilities under PFCRA as Authority Head are delegated to the Army General Counsel. The Chief, Intellectual Property Law Division, is the Army's Reviewing Official within the meaning of PFCRA. Army implementation also requires DA to follow the policies and procedures prescribed in enclosure 2 of DOD Directive 5505.5. (See appendix E to this part.)</P>
                <P>(d) The DOD Inspector General (IG) is the Investigating Official within DOD. The duties of this position will be performed by the Assistant IG For Investigations. This individual is vested with the authority to investigate all allegations of liability under PFCRA. That authority includes the power to task subordinate investigative agencies to review and report on allegations that are subject to PFCRA. If the Investigative Official concludes that an action under PFCRA is warranted in an Army case, the official will submit a report containing the findings and conclusions of such investigation through PFD to the Army Reviewing Official.</P>
                <P>(e) Pursuant to DOD IG guidance, USACIDC will forward appropriate cases that appear to qualify for resolution under PFCRA to the Investigating Official in a timely manner. Additionally, USACIDC will forward current information regarding the status of remedies pending or concluded. USACIDC may obtain remedies information by coordinating with PFD and the cognizant command.</P>
                <P>(f) In pay and entitlement or transportation operation fraud cases, USACIDC will coordinate with the Office of the Secretary of the Army, Financial Management, Review and Oversight Directorate (SAFM-RO), to determine the status of any pending or proposed action under the Debt Collection Act. This information, in addition to information obtained under § 517.68(e), will be forwarded with appropriate cases to the Investigating Official.</P>

                <P>(g) In those cases where the Investigating Official has submitted a report to the Army Reviewing Official for action under PFCRA, PFD will, at the direction of the Reviewing Official, prepare all legal memoranda as necessary to transmit the Reviewing Official's intention to issue a complaint. As part of this responsibility PFD will do the following: coordinate with the affected command or agency to ensure that all appropriate remedies have been considered; evaluate the overall potential benefits to the Army; and, ensure that action under PFCRA is not duplicative of other remedies already taken. In order to fully supplement the Reviewing Official's file, PFD may request a litigation report.<PRTPAGE P="111"/>
                </P>
                <P>(h) PFD will coordinate all cases involving transportation operations emanating from Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) activity, under the military transportation exception to the FAR, and all cases involving pay and entitlements fraud with SAFM-RO, for comments and recommendations. These matters will be forwarded with the case file to the Reviewing Official.</P>
                <P>(i) If the Attorney General approves the issuance of a complaint, PFD, at the direction of the Army Reviewing Official, shall prepare the complaint and all necessary memoranda as required. PFD shall also designate attorneys to represent the Authority in hearings under PFCRA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Witnesses and counsel for consultation.</E> (1) DA military and civilian managers, supervisors, and employees who are requested by OSC for an interview will be made available in accordance with arrangements the Labor Counselor will establish. Requests for the testimony of IGs will be coordinated with the Inspector General Legal Office, SAIG-ZXL, DSN 227-9734 or Commercial (703) 697-9734.</P>

                <P>(2) The Labor Counselor will ensure that witnesses are aware of their obligation to answer OSC questions, their potential to be considered “suspects” in OSC investigations, and their right to the assistance of counsel during interviews with OSC representatives. If the requested witness is not an “accused” or “suspected” individual and <PRTPAGE P="113"/>the witness asks for assistance of counsel, a DA attorney will be made available for the limited purpose of consultation regarding the witness' rights and obligations. An attorney-client relationship will not be established. (See appendix F to this part).</P>
                <P>(3) The Labor Counselor will arrange for individual counsel for consultation from local assets. If local assets are not sufficient, assistance may be requested from other DOD activities in the area or from HQDA, DAJA-LE. DA attorneys tasked to consult with one or more witnesses individually will not be tasked to represent the DA activity concerned.</P>
                <P>(4) The Labor Counselor, as the legal representative of the activity, is precluded from assisting or representing individual witnesses during OSC interviews.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">“Accused” or “suspected” DA personnel and counsel for representation.</E> (1) If the OSC identifies a DA civilian employee or a military member as an “accused” or “suspected” individual, or if the Labor Counselor concludes that an individual is a “suspect,” the Labor Counselor will inform the individual. The Labor Counselor also will advise the individual of the availability of counsel for representation upon approval by DA General Counsel. (See Glossary, Counsel for Representation).</P>
                <P>(2) If the “suspected” individual desires legal representation by DA, the individual must request counsel by submitting a written request through DAJA-LE to DA General Counsel. (See figure I-1, appendix G, to this part).</P>
                <P>(3) During the investigation but prior to DA General Counsel approval of the request for counsel, an “accused” or “suspected” individual will be provided the assistance of counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other OSC requested witness. “Accused” or “suspected” individuals who do not request counsel for representation will be provided counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other OSC requested witness.</P>
                <P>(4) If the DA General Counsel approves the request for counsel, the Chief, DAJA-LE, will appoint a DA attorney to represent the individual. This appointment may be made telephonically but will be confirmed in writing. The Chief, DAJA-LE, will make appropriate coordination with MACOM SJAs and command counsel to confirm availability of the attorney.</P>
                <P>(5) An attorney appointed by DA may represent a civilian employee in any proceeding initiated by OSC before the MSPB. However, counsel provided by DA may not represent the employee in any proceeding initiated by DA, in any appeal from a final decision by the MSPB, or in any collateral proceeding before any forum other than the MSPB.</P>
                <P>(6) OSC may not bring a disciplinary action before the MSPB against a military member. Accordingly, DA counsel will not be required to represent the military member in any MSPB disciplinary proceeding. However, counsel may represent the member during the OSC investigation with the understanding that the evidence obtained by OSC may be referred to the member's command for possible disciplinary action under the UCMJ or appropriate regulations. If DA initiates action against the military member for misconduct disclosed in the OSC investigation, the member will obtain counsel as provided under the UCMJ or relevant regulations.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Records.</E> (1) OSC requests for records must be in writing. The Labor Counselor will assist OSC representatives in identifying the custodian of specific records sought during the inquiry.</P>
                <P>(2) Generally, requested records should be furnished to OSC representatives if such records would be released under AR 25-55 or AR 340-21 to other government agencies in the normal course of official business. Records constituting attorney work product should not be released without approval of the Chief, DAJA-LE. IG records will not be released without the approval of the Inspector General. (AR 20-1). The Labor Counselor should seek guidance from the Chief, DAJA-LE, if there is any doubt concerning the release of records.</P>

                <P>(3) If, after completion of the OSC investigation, the OSC files a complaint against DA or a DA employee, release of records and other information will be accomplished pursuant to MSPB <PRTPAGE P="114"/>rules of discovery (5 CFR part 1201, subpart B).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Funding.</E> The command, activity, or installation within which the allegations of misconduct arose will provide funding for travel, per diem and other necessary expenses related to the OSC investigation. These expenses may include appropriate funding for witnesses, counsel for consultation and DA General Counsel approved counsel for representation.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Purpose</HD>
                <P>Under Section 301 reference (a) and reference (b), this Directive establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the release of official DoD information in litigation and for testimony by DoD personnel as witnesses during litigation.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Applicability and Scope</HD>
                <P>1. This Directive applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (OJCS), the Unified and Specified Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to as “DoD Components”), and to all personnel of such DoD Components.</P>
                <P>2. This Directive does not apply to the release of official information or testimony by DoD personnel in the following situations:</P>
                <P>a. Before courts-martial convened by the authority of the Military Departments or in administrative proceedings conducted by or on behalf of a DoD Component;</P>
                <P>b. Pursuant to administrative proceedings conducted by or on behalf of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), or pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure under a collective bargaining agreement to which the Government is a party;</P>
                <P>c. In response to requests by Federal Government counsel in litigation conducted on behalf of the United States;</P>
                <P>d. As part of the assistance required in accordance with the Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Program under DoD Directive 5220.6 (reference (c)); or</P>

                <P>3. This Directive does not supersede or modify existing laws or DoD programs governing the testimony of DoD personnel or the release of official DoD information during grand jury proceedings, the release of official information not involved in litigation, or the release of official information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 (reference (a)) or the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a (reference (a)), nor does this Directive preclude treating any written request for agency records that is not in the nature of legal process as a request under the Freedom of Information or Privacy Acts.</P>
                <P>4. This Directive is not intended to infringe upon or displace the responsibilities committed to the Department of Justice in conducting litigation on behalf of the United States in appropriate cases.</P>
                <P>5. This Directive does not preclude official comment on matters in litigation in appropriate cases.</P>
                <P>6. This Directive is intended only to provide guidance for the internal operation of the Department of Defense and is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law against the United States or the Department of Defense.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Definitions</HD>
                <P>1. Demand. Subpoena, order, or other demand of a court of competent jurisdiction, or other specific authority for the production, disclosure, or release of official DoD information or for the appearance and testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses.</P>

Present and former U.S. military personnel; Service Academy cadets and midshipmen; and present and former civilian employees of any Component of the Department of Defense, including nonappropriated fund activity employees; non-U.S. nationals who perform services overseas, under the provisions of status of forces agreements, for the United States Armed Forces; and other specific individuals hired through contractual agreements by or on behalf of the Department of Defense.</P>
                <P>3. Litigation. All pretrial, trial, and post-trial stages of all existing or reasonably anticipated judicial or administrative actions, hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before civilian courts, commissions, boards (including the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals), or other tribunals, foreign and domestic. This term includes responses to discovery requests, depositions, and other pretrial proceedings, as well as responses to formal or informal requests by attorneys or others in situations involving litigation.</P>
                <P>4. Official Information. All information of any kind, however stored, that is in the custody and control of the Department of Defense, relates to information in the custody and control of the Department, or was acquired by DoD personnel as part of their official duties or because of their official status within the Department while such personnel were employed by or on behalf of the Department or on active duty with the United States Armed Forces.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Policy</HD>

                <P>It is DoD policy that official information should generally be made reasonably available for use in Federal and state courts and by other governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure.<PRTPAGE P="118"/>
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Responsibilities</HD>
                <P>1. The General Counsel, Department of Defense (GC, DoD), shall provide general policy and procedural guidance by the issuance of supplemental instructions or specific orders concerning the release of official DoD information in litigation and the testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses during litigation.</P>
                <P>2. The Heads of DoD Components shall issue appropriate regulations to implement this Directive and to identify official information that is involved in litigation.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Procedures</HD>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Authority To Act</HD>
                <P>a. In response to a litigation request or demand for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses, the General Counsels of DoD, Navy, and the Defense Agencies; the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments; and the Chief Legal Advisors to the JCS and the Unified and Specified Commands, with regard to their respective Components, are authorized—after consulting and coordinating with the appropriate Department of Justice litigation attorneys, as required—to determine whether official information originated by the Component may be released in litigation; whether DoD personnel assigned to or affiliated with the Component may be interviewed, contacted, or used as witnesses concerning official DoD information or as expert witnesses; and what, if any, conditions will be imposed upon such release, interview, contact, or testimony. Delegation of this authority, to include the authority to invoke appropriate claims of privilege before any tribunal, is permitted.</P>
                <P>b. In the event that a DoD Component receives a litigation request or demand for official information originated by another Component, the receiving Component shall forward the appropriate portions of the request or demand to the originating Component for action in accordance with this Directive. The receiving Component shall also notify the requestor, court, or other authority of its transfer of the request or demand.</P>
                <P>c. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs F.1.a. and b., the GC, DoD, in litigation involving terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, intelligence means or sources, or otherwise as deemed necessary, may notify Components that GC, DoD, will assume primary responsibility for coordinating all litigation requests and demands for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel, or both; consulting with the Department of Justice, as required; and taking final action on such requests and demands.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Factors To Consider</HD>
                <P>In deciding whether to authorize the release of official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel concerning official information (hereinafter referred to as “the disclosure”) pursuant to paragraph F.1., DoD officials should consider the following types of factors:</P>
                <P>a. Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules;</P>
                <P>b. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the request or demand arose;</P>
                <P>c. Whether the disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive;</P>
                <P>d. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;</P>
                <P>e. Whether the disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information properly classified pursuant to the DoD Information Security Program under DoD 5200.1-R (reference (d)), unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25 (reference (e)), or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; and</P>
                <P>f. Whether disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Decisions on Litigation Requests and Demands</HD>
                <P>a. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel shall not, in response to a litigation request or demand, produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning any official DoD information without the prior written approval of the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. Oral approval may be granted, but a record of such approval shall be made and retained in accordance with the applicable implementing regulations.</P>

                <P>b. If official DoD information is sought, through testimony or otherwise, by a litigation request or demand, the individual seeking such release or testimony must set forth, in writing and with as much specificity as possible, the nature and relevance of the official information sought. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel may only produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters that were specified in writing and properly approved by the appropriate DoD official designated in <PRTPAGE P="119"/>paragraph F.1. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).</P>
                <P>c. Whenever a litigation request or demand is made upon DoD personnel for official DoD information or for testimony concerning such information, the personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall immediately notify the DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. for the Component to which the individual contacted is or, for former personnel, was last assigned. In appropriate cases, the responsible DoD official shall thereupon notify the Department of Justice of the request or demands. After due consultation and coordination with the Department of Justice, as required, the DoD official shall determine whether the individual is required to comply with the request or demand and shall notify the requestor or the court or other authority of the determination reached.</P>
                <P>d. If, after DoD personnel have received a litigation request or demand and have in turn notified the appropriate DoD official in accordance with paragraph F.3.c., a response to the request or demand is required before instructions from the responsible official are received, the responsible official designated in paragraph F.1. shall furnish the requestor or the court or other authority with a copy of this Directive and applicable implementing regulations, inform the requestor or the court or other authority that the request or demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of the request or demand pending a final determination by the Component concerned.</P>

                <P>e. If a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority declines to stay the effect of the request or demand in response to action taken pursuant to paragraph F.3.d., or if such court or other authority orders that the request or demand must be complied with notwithstanding the final decision of the appropriate DoD official, the DoD personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall notify the responsible DoD official of such ruling or order. If the DoD official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's ruling or order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the request, demand, or order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel. <E T="03">Touhy</E> v. <E T="03">Ragen,</E> 340 U.S. 462 (1951).</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Fees</HD>
                <P>Consistent with the guidelines in DoD Instruction 7230.7 (reference (f)), the appropriate officials designated in paragraph F.1. are authorized to charge reasonable fees, as established by regulation and to the extent not prohibited by law, to parties seeking, by request or demand, official DoD information not otherwise available under the DoD Freedom of Information Act Program (reference (g)). Such fees, in amounts calculated to reimburse the Government for the expense of providing such information, may include the costs of time expended by DoD employees to process and respond to the request or demand; attorney time for reviewing the request or demand and any information located in response thereto and for related legal work in connection with the request or demand; and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340 (1978).</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Expert or Opinion Testimony</HD>
                <P>DoD personnel shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department of Justice. Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the Department of Defense or the United States, the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. may, in writing, grant special authorization for DoD personnel to appear and testify at no expense to the United States. If, despite the final determination of the responsible DoD official, a court of competent jurisdiction, or other appropriate authority, orders the appearance and expert or opinion testimony of DoD personnel, the personnel shall notify the responsible DoD official of such order. If the DoD official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel. Touhy v.

                <P>This Directive reissues reference (a) to update policies, procedures, and responsibilities for the coordination of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies stemming from investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities. More effective and timely communication of information developed during such investigations will enable the Department of Defense to take the most appropriate of the available measures.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Applicability</HD>
                <P>This Directive applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); the Inspector General, Department of Defense (IG, DoD); the Military Departments; the Defense Agencies; and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as “DoD Components”).</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Definitions</HD>
                <P>1. <E T="03">DoD Criminal Investigative Organizations.</E> Refers to the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command; the Naval Investigative Service Command; the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations; and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Office of the IG, DoD (OIG, DoD).</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Significant.</E> Refers to all fraud cases involving an alleged loss of $100,000, or more; all corruption cases related to procurement that involved bribery, gratuities, or conflicts of interest; and any investigation into defective products or product substitution in which a SERIOUS HAZARD to health, safety, or operational readiness is indicated, regardless of loss value.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Policy</HD>
                <P>It is DoD policy that:</P>
                <P>1. Each of the DoD Components shall monitor, from its inception, all significant investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities affecting its organizations, for the purpose of ensuring that all possible criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies in such cases are identified to cognizant procurement and command officials and that appropriate remedies are pursued expeditiously. This process shall include appropriate coordination with all other affected DoD Components.</P>
                <P>2. All investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities shall be reviewed to determine and implement the appropriate contractual and administrative actions that are necessary to recover funds lost through fraud or corruption and to ensure the integrity of DoD programs and operations.</P>
                <P>3. Appropriate civil, contractual, and administrative actions, including those set forth in enclosure 1, shall be taken expeditiously. During an investigation and before prosecution or litigation, and when based in whole or in part on evidence developed during an investigation, such actions shall be taken with the advance knowledge of the responsible DoD criminal investigative organization and, when necessary, the appropriate legal counsel in the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice (DoJ). When appropriate, such actions shall be taken before final resolution of the criminal or civil case.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Responsibilities</HD>
                <P>1. The <E T="03">Heads of DoD Components</E> shall:</P>
                <P>a. Establish a centralized organization (hereafter referred to as “the centralized organization”) to monitor and ensure the coordination of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies for each significant investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities affecting the DoD Component.</P>
                <P>b. Establish procedures requiring the centralized organization to discuss regularly with the assigned DoD criminal investigative organization(s) such issues as the current status of significant investigations and their coordination with prosecutive authorities.</P>
                <P>c. Establish procedures requiring that all coordination involving the DoJ, during the pendency of a criminal investigation, is accomplished by or with the advance knowledge of the appropriate DoD criminal investigative organization(s).</P>
                <P>d. Establish procedures to ensure appropriate coordination of actions between the centralized organizations of any DoD Components affected by a significant investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.</P>

                <P>e. Establish procedures to ensure that all proper and effective civil, administrative, and contractual remedies available to the Department of Defense are, when found applicable and appropriate, considered and undertaken promptly by the necessary DoD officials (e.g., commanders, programs officials, and contracting officers). This includes initiation of any suspension and debarment action within 30 days of an indictment or conviction. The centralized organization shall <PRTPAGE P="121"/>ensure that all proposed actions are coordinated with appropriate investigative organization.</P>
                <P>f. Establish procedures to ensure that a specific comprehensive remedies plan is developed for each significant investigation involving fraud or corruption related to procurement activities. These procedures shall include the participation of the appropriate DoD criminal investigative organization in the development of the plan.</P>
                <P>g. Establish procedures to ensure that in those significant investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities when adverse impact on a DoD mission can be determined, such adverse impact is identified and documented by the centralized organization. This information is to be used by the centralized organization of the DoD Component concerned in development of the remedies plan required in paragraph E.1.f., above, and shall be furnished to prosecutors as stated in paragraph E.2.e., below. The information shall also be used by the centralized organizations in development and preparation of “Victim Impact Statements” for use in sentencing proceedings, as provided for P.L. 97-291 (reference (b)). Some examples of adverse impact on a DoD mission are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Endangerment of personnel or property.</P>
                <P>(2) Monetary loss.</P>
                <P>(3) Denigration of program or personnel integrity.</P>
                <P>(4) Compromise of the procurement process.</P>
                <P>(5) Reduction or loss of mission readiness.</P>
                <P>h. Ensure training materials are developed on fraud and corruption in the procurement process, and that all procurement and procurement-related training includes a period of such instruction appropriate to the duration and nature of the training.</P>
                <P>i. Establish procedures enabling the centralized organization to ensure that safety and readiness issues are examined and appropriately dealt with for all cases in which a notice is required under paragraph E.2.i., below. The minimum procedures to be followed by the centralized organization are in enclosure 3.</P>
                <P>j. Ensure that appropriate command, procurement, and investigative organizations are provided sufficient information to determine if further inquiry is warranted on their part to prevent reoccurrence and detect other possible fraud within their activity.</P>
                <P>2. The <E T="03">Secretaries of the Military Departments</E> and the <E T="03">Inspector General, Department of Defense (IG, DoD),</E> or their designees, shall establish procedures that ensure that their respective criminal investigative organizations will:</P>
                <P>a. Notify, in writing, the centralized organization for the affected DoD Component of the start of all significant investigations involving fraud or corruption that are related to procurement activities. Initial notification shall include the following elements:</P>
                <P>(1) Case title.</P>
                <P>(2) Case control number.</P>
                <P>(3) Investigative agency and office of primary responsibility.</P>
                <P>(4) Date opened.</P>
                <P>(5) Predication.</P>
                <P>(6) Suspected offense(s).</P>
                <P>b. Notify expeditiously the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) of any investigations that develop evidence that would impact on DoD-cleared industrial facilities or personnel.</P>
                <P>c. Discuss regularly with the centralized organization such issues as the current status of significant investigations and their coordination with prosecutive authorities. If the DoD criminal investigative organization has prepared any documents summarizing the current status of the investigation, such documents shall be provided to the centralized organization. Completed reports of significant investigations also should be provided to the centralized organization.</P>
                <P>d. Provide to the appropriate procurement officials, commanders, and suspension and debarment authorities, when needed to allow consideration of applicable remedies, any court records, documents, or other evidence of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities. Such information shall be provided in a timely manner to enable the suspension and debarment authority to initiate suspension and debarment action within 30 days of an indictment or conviction.</P>
                <P>e. Provide expeditiously to prosecutive authorities the information regarding any adverse impact on a DoD mission, that is gathered under paragraph E.1.g., above, for the purpose of enhancing the prosecutability of a case. Such information also should be used in preparing a victim impact statement for use in sentencing proceedings as provided for in Public Law 97-291.</P>
                <P>f. Gather, at the earliest practical point in the investigation, without reliance on grand jury subpoenas whenever possible, relevant information concerning responsible individuals, the organizational structure, finances, and contract history of DoD contractors under investigation for fraud or corruption related to procurement activities, to facilitate the criminal investigation as well as any civil, administrative, or contractual actions or remedies that may be taken. Some available sources of such information are listed in enclosure 2.</P>
                <P>g. Provide timely notice to other cognizant DoD criminal investigative organizations of evidence of fraud by a contractor, subcontractor, or employees of either, on current or past contracts with, or affecting, other DoD Components.</P>

                <P>h. Ascertain the impact upon any ongoing investigation or prosecution of civil, contractual, and administrative actions being <PRTPAGE P="122"/>considered and advise the appropriate centralized organization of any adverse impact.</P>
                <P>i. Obtain a DD 350 report in every investigation into defective products or product substitution in which a SERIOUS HAZARD to health, safety, or operational readiness is indicated. Timely notification shall be made to the centralized organization of each DoD Component that is identified as having contract actions with the subject of the investigation.</P>
                <P>j. Obtain a DD 350 report in all significant fraud investigations, as defined in subsection C.2. above, whether or not the case involved defective products or product substitution. Timely notification shall be made to the centralized organization of each DoD Component that is identified as having contract actions with the subject of the investigation.</P>
                <P>3. The <E T="03">Inspector General, Department of Defense</E> (IG, DoD), shall:</P>
                <P>a. Develop training materials relating to fraud and corruption in procurement related activities which shall be utilized in all procurement related training in conjunction with training materials developed by the DoD Components. (See paragraph E.1.h., above.)</P>
                <P>b. Establish procedures for providing to the DoD criminal investigative organizations, through the Office of the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing (OAIG-AUD), reports of data contained in the Individual Procurement Action Report (DD Form 350) System.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Procedures</HD>
                <P>Transmissions of information by DoD criminal investigative organizations required by subsection E.2., above, shall be made as expeditiously as possible, consistent with efforts not to compromise any ongoing criminal investigation. The transmission of the information may be delayed when, in the judgment of the head of the DoD criminal investigative organization, failure to delay would compromise the success of any investigation or prosecution. The prosecutive authorities dealing with the investigation shall be consulted, when appropriate, in making such determinations.</P>

                </FP>

                <P>Dear Mr. Taylor: We have learned that you subpoenaed Captain Roberta Selby to testify at a deposition in the case <E T="03">Kramer</E> v. <E T="03">Kramer,</E> currently filed in state court, and that you directed her to bring her legal assistance file concerning her client, SSG Kramer.</P>
                <P>Under 32 CFR §§ 97.6(c), 516.35, and 516.40, the Army must authorize the appearance of its personnel or the production of official documents in private litigation. In this case, the Army cannot authorize Captain Selby to appear or produce the requested file absent the following:</P>

                <P>You must request in writing her appearance and the production of the file in accordance with Department of Defense directives, 32 CFR § 97.6(c), and Army regulations, 32 CFR §§ 516.34-516.40. The request must include the nature of the proceeding, 32 CFR § 516.34(b), and the nature and relevance of the official information sought. <E T="03">Id.</E> § 516.35(d). We cannot act on your request until we receive the required information. <E T="03">See, for example, United States ex rel. Touhy</E> v. <E T="03">Ragen,</E> 340 U.S. 462 (1951); <E T="03">Boron Oil Co.</E> v. <E T="03">Downie,</E> 873 F.2d 67 (4th Cir. 1989); <E T="03">United States</E> v. <E T="03">Bizzard,</E> 674 F.2d 1382 (11th Cir. 1982); <E T="03">United States</E> v. <E T="03">Marino,</E> 658 F.2d 1120 (6th Cir. 1981); <E T="03">United States</E> v. <E T="03">Allen,</E> 554 F.2d 398 (10th Cir. 1977).</P>

                <P>To overcome Federal statutory restrictions on the disclosure of the requested file imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, you must provide either a written release authorization signed by the individual to whom the file pertains (that is, SSG Kramer) or a court ordered release signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. A subpoena signed by a clerk of court, notary, or other official is insufficient. <E T="03">See, for example, Doe</E> v. <E T="03">DiGenova,</E> 779 F.2d 74 (DC Cir. 1985).</P>

                <P>In this case, because of the attorney-client relationship between Captain Selby and SSG Kramer, you must produce a written waiver of the attorney-client privilege from SSG Kramer. Because the privilege may protect both documents and testimony, Captain Selby may not divulge such information without SSG Kramer's consent. <E T="03">See, for example,</E> Rule of Professional Conduct for Army Lawyers 1.6(a).</P>

                <P>In addition to the above requirements, Captain Selby's supervisor must approve her absence from duty. <E T="03">See</E> 32 CFR § 516.43. In this regard, we suggest you take the deposition at Fort Smith. In any event, however, you or your client must pay all travel expenses, as this is purely private litigation and witness' appearance must be at no expense to the United States. <E T="03">See id.</E> § 516.48(c).</P>

                <P>Finally, if Captain Selby does appear as a witness, she may only give factual testimony. She may not testify as an opinion or expert witness. This limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy that generally prohibits Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation. <E T="03">See id.</E> §§ 97.6(e), 516.42.</P>

                <P>Our sole concern in this matter is to protect the interests of the United States Army; the Army will not block access to witnesses or documents to which you are lawfully entitled. So that the Army can adequately protect its interests in this matter, I request that you respond to this letter by 27 April 1993. If you have any questions, please call CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.

                <P>This grant of authority is limited to factual testimony only. Captain Sawyer may not testify as an expert witness. This limitation is based on Army policy prohibiting Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation. <E T="03">See</E> 32 CFR § 516.42. Captain Sawyer may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure.</P>

                <P>The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the prospective witness. This authorization is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States. <E T="03">See</E> 32 CFR § 516.48.</P>

                <P>Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request for Mr. Charles Montrose to appear as an expert witness in private litigation: <E T="03">Smithers</E> v. <E T="03">ABC Video.</E> For the following reasons, the request is denied.</P>
                <P>Army Regulation 27-40 forbids Army personnel from providing expert testimony in private litigation, with or without compensation, except under the most extraordinary circumstances. See 32 CFR §§ 97.6(e), 516.42. Several reasons support the exercise of strict control over such witness appearances.</P>
                <P>The Army policy is one of strict impartiality in litigation in which the Army is not a named party, a real party in interest, or in which the Army does not have a significant interest. When a witness with an official connection with the Army testifies, a natural tendency exists to assume that the testimony represents the official view of the Army, despite express disclaimers to the contrary.</P>
                <P>The Army is also interested in preventing the unnecessary loss of the services of its personnel in connection with matters unrelated to their official responsibilities. If Army personnel testify as expert witnesses in private litigation, their official duties are invariably disrupted, often at the expense of the Army's mission and the Federal taxpayer.</P>
                <P>Finally, the Army is concerned about the potential for conflict of interest inherent in the unrestricted appearance of its personnel as expert witnesses on behalf of parties other than the United States. Even the appearance of such conflicts of interest seriously undermines the public trust and confidence in the integrity of our Government.</P>
                <P>This case does not present the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the requested witness' expert testimony. You have demonstrated no exceptional need or unique circumstances that would warrant (his or her) appearance. The expert testimony desired can be secured from non-Army sources. Consequently, we are unable to grant you an exception to the Army's policy.</P>

                <P>If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.

                </FP>
                <P>Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request to depose Dr. (MAJ) J. McDonald, Fort Smith Medical Treatment Facility. Pursuant to 32 CFR §§ 516.33-516.49, you may depose him subject to the following conditions:</P>
                <P>He may testify as to his treatment of his patient, Sergeant Rock, as to related laboratory tests he may have conducted, or other actions he took in the regular course of his duties.</P>
                <P>He must limit his testimony to factual matters such as his observations of the patient or other operative facts, the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken, course of recovery or steps required for treatment of injuries suffered, or contemplated future treatment.</P>

                <P>His testimony may not extend to hypothetical questions or to a prognosis. He may not testify as an “expert.” This limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy prohibiting present or former military personnel and Army civilian employees from providing opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects, or activities in private litigation. <E T="03">See</E> 32 CFR §§ 97.6(e), 516.42.</P>
                <P>The witnesses may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure. To protect the Army's interests, CPT Taylor or another Army attorney will be present during the depositions.</P>

                <P>To overcome restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, Dr. McDonald may not discuss matters derived from the patient's medical records absent the patient's written consent or a court order signed by a judge. A subpoena issued by someone other than a judge or magistrate is insufficient. <E T="03">See Doe</E> v. <E T="03">DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Stiles</E> v. <E T="03">Atlanta Gas Light Co.,</E> 453 F. Supp. 798 (N.D. Ga. 1978).</P>
                <P>The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the witness, subject to the approval of his supervisors to be absent during the period involved.</P>

                <P>Finally, because this is private litigation, the witnesses' participation must be at no expense to the United States. <E T="03">See</E> 32 CFR § 516.48.</P>

                <P>If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.

                <P>1. During the identification of the government and services.</P>
                <P>a. Need determinations for items currently scheduled for disposal or reprocurement, or which have predetermined reorder levels.</P>
                <P>b. Excessive purchase of “expendables” such as drugs or auto parts.</P>
                <P>c. Inadequate or vague need assessment.</P>
                <P>d. Frequent changes in the need assessment or determination.</P>
                <P>e. Mandatory stock levels and inventory requirements appear excessive.</P>
                <P>f. Items appear to be unnecessarily declared excess or sold as surplus, while same items are being reprocured.</P>
                <P>g. It appears that an item or service is being purchased more as a result of aggressive marketing efforts rather than in response to a valid requirement.</P>
                <P>h. Need determination appears to be unnecessarily tailored in ways that can only be met by certain contractors.</P>
                <P>i. Items and services are continually obtained from the same source due to an unwarranted lack of effort to develop second sources.</P>
                <P>2. During the development of the statements of work and specifications.</P>
                <P>a. Statements of work and specifications appear to be intentionally written to fit the products or capabilities of a single contractor.</P>
                <P>b. Statements of work, specifications, or sole source justifications developed by or in consultation with a preferred contractor.</P>
                <P>c. Information concerning requirements and pending contracts is released only to preferred contractors.</P>
                <P>d. Allowing companies and industry personnel who participated in the preparation of bid packages to perform on subsequent contracts in either a prime or subcontractor capacity.</P>
                <P>e. Release of information by firms or personnel participating in design or engineering to companies competing for prime contract.</P>
                <P>f. Prequalification standards or specifications appear designed to exclude otherwise qualified contractors or their productions.</P>
                <P>g. Requirements appear split up to allow for rotating bids, giving each contractor his or her “fair share.”</P>
                <P>h. Requirements appear split up to meet small purchase requirements (that is, $25,000) or to avoid higher levels of approval that would be otherwise required.</P>
                <P>i. Bid specifications or statement of work appear inconsistent with the items described in the general requirements.</P>
                <P>j. Specifications appear so vague that reasonable comparisons of estimate would be difficult.</P>
                <P>k. Specifications appear inconsistent with previous procurements of similar items of services.</P>
                <P>3. During the presolicitation phase.</P>
                <P>a. Sole source justifications appear unnecessary or poorly supported.</P>
                <P>b. Statements justifying sole source or negotiated procurements appear inadequate or incredible.</P>
                <P>c. Solicitation documents appear to contain unnecessary requirements which tend to restrict competition.</P>
                <P>d. Contractors or their representatives appear to have received advanced information related to the proposed procurement on a preferential basis.</P>
                <P>4. During the solicitation phase.</P>
                <P>a. Procurement appears to be processed so as to exclude or impede certain contractors.</P>
                <P>b. The time for submission of bids appears to be unnecessarily limited so that only those with advance information have adequate time to prepare bids or proposals.</P>
                <P>c. It appears that information concerning the procurement has been revealed only to certain contractors, without being revealed to all prospective competitors.</P>
                <P>d. Bidders conferences are conducted in a way that apparently invites bid rigging, price fixing, or other improper collusion between contractors.</P>
                <P>e. There is an apparent intentional failure to fairly publish notice of the solicitation.</P>
                <P>f. Solicitation appears vague as to the details such as time, place and manner, of submitting acceptable bids.</P>
                <P>g. There is evidence of improper communications or social contract between contractors and government personnel.</P>
                <P>h. Controls over the number and destination of bid packages sent to interested bidders appear inadequate.</P>
                <P>i. Indications that government personnel or their families may own stock or have some other financial interest in either a contractor or subcontractor.</P>
                <P>j. Indications that government personnel are discussing possible employment for themselves or a family member with a contractor or subcontractor or indications that a proposal for future employment from a contractor or subcontractor to a government employee or his or her family members has not been firmly rejected.</P>
                <P>k. Indications that any contractor has received special assistance in preparation of his or her bid or proposal.</P>
                <P>l. It appears that a contract is given an expressed or implied reference to a specific subcontractor.</P>
                <P>m. Failure to amend solicitation to reflect necessary changes or modifications.</P>
                <P>5. During the submission of bids and proposals.</P>
                <P>a. Improper acceptance of a late bid.</P>

                <P>b. Documents, such as receipts, appear falsified to obtain acceptance of a late bid.<PRTPAGE P="132"/>
                </P>
                <P>c. Improperly attempting to change a bid after other bidders prices are known.</P>
                <P>d. Indications that mistakes have been deliberately planted in a bid to support correction after bid opening.</P>
                <P>e. Withdrawal by a low bidder who may later become a subcontractor to a higher bidder who gets the contract.</P>
                <P>f. Apparent collusion or bid rigging among the bidders.</P>
                <P>g. Bidders apparently revealing their prices to each other.</P>
                <P>h. Required contractor certifications appear falsified.</P>
                <P>i. Information concerning contractor's qualifications, finances, and capabilities appears falsified.</P>
                <P>6. During the evaluation of bids and proposals.</P>
                <P>a. Deliberately losing or discarding bids of certain contractors.</P>
                <P>b. Improperly disqualifying the bids or proposals of certain contractors.</P>
                <P>c. Accepting apparently nonresponsive bids from preferred contractors.</P>
                <P>d. Unusual or unnecessary contacts between government personnel and contractors during solicitation, evaluation, and negotiation.</P>
                <P>e. Any apparently unauthorized release of procurement information to a contractor or to non-government personnel.</P>
                <P>f. Any apparent favoritism in the evaluation of the bid or proposal of a particular contractor.</P>
                <P>g. Apparent bias in the evaluation criteria or in the attitude or actions of the members of the evaluation panel.</P>
                <P>7. During contract formation and administration.</P>
                <P>a. Defective pricing by the contractor usually associated with submitting false cost and pricing data under the Truth in Negotiation Act.</P>

                <P>1. Under no circumstances is testing to proceed unless the command has committed sufficient funding to cover the entire cost of the projected testing.</P>
                <P>2. No testing will be initiated unless there has been a written request for the testing to the appropriate Procurement Fraud Advisor from a criminal investigator or Assistant United States Attorney or Department of Justice Attorney (AUSA is used in these procedures to indicate either an AUSA or Department of Justice attorney). If they have not already done so, criminal investigators should be requested to coordinate their testing requests with the AUSA overseeing the investigation.</P>
                <P>3. Barring extraordinary circumstances, only one test will be conducted to support the criminal and civil recovery efforts of a procurement fraud/irregularity matter. Early coordination with the Civil Division of Department of Justice or the local United States Attorneys Office is necessary to ensure that testing funds are not wasted.</P>

                <P>4. The request for testing should include a clear, concise statement of the purpose of the testing to include a statement of the allegations made and the contact number(s) involved. <E T="03">Any test plan which requires destructive testing must be approved by the AUSA.</E>
                </P>

                <P>5. No testing will be initiated unless a test plan has been developed which states the following:
                </P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">a. the contract number(s) involved</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">b. the National Stock Number (NSN) of the item to be tested</FP>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">n. the PRON to fund the testing</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">o. a retention plan.</FP>
                <P>6. The test plan shall be coordinated with the concurrence received in advance from the appropriate personnel in the Procurement Directorate, Product Assurance and Test Directorate, the Procurement Fraud Advisor, and the investigator/AUSA requesting the test. No testing will be initiated until the criminal investigator/AUSA who requested the testing has approved the test plan.</P>

                <P>7. If the items tested are to be retained as evidence, the criminal investigator should arrange for retention of the evidence. While the Command will support evidence retention, this is primarily the responsibility of the criminal investigators. Agents should be advised that putting items in Code L or similar non-use status is insufficient to protect it from being released to the field. <E T="03">A decision not to retain the tested items as evidence must have the approval of the AUSA.</E>
                </P>
                <P>8. All items to be tested should be from a statistically valid random sample. The sample should conform with the inspection requirements of the contract or be in conformance with a random sample specifically developed for the instant test plan. It is recommended that a statistician be consulted to determine the feasibility of a random sample specifically created to support the test plan.</P>

                <P>9. Results of testing should be available to Command and DA personnel for appropriate contractual and administrative remedies. <PRTPAGE P="134"/>Any request for testing results that indicates that dissemination of the testing results will be limited by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be forwarded through the MACOM or AMC Procurement Fraud Coordinator to DA Procurement Fraud Division prior to the initiation of any testing.</P>
                <P>10. Resolution of problems associated with testing requests should be conducted at the local level. In AMC the authority to refuse a testing request resides with the Office of Command Counsel. Any disputes which cannot be resolved at the local level will be forwarded to the AMC or MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator for resolution. This includes disputes regarding funding or any time sensitive issues.</P>

                <P>11. Second requests for testing of the same item due to a change in the investigative plan require coordination by the PFA with the investigator <E T="03">and</E> AUSA overseeing the investigation to determine the deficiencies in the earlier test. Disputes which cannot be resolved between the AUSA, PFA, and investigator regarding testing are to be forwarded simultaneously to the MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator and PFD for resolution. The procedures established in paragraphs 5 and 6 apply for second requests for testing with the additional requirement that the Assistant United States Attorney must be requested to approve the test plan.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Overview</HD>
                <P>a. DA employees or military members asked to provide information (testimonial or documentary) to OSC may obtain legal advice through the Labor Counselor from DA attorneys concerning their rights and obligations. This includes assistance at any interviews with OSC investigators. However, an attorney-client relationship will not be established unless the employee or military member—</P>
                <P>(1) Is suspected or accused by the OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act; and</P>
                <P>(2) Has been assigned counsel by the DA General Counsel.</P>
                <P>b. Any military member or employee who reasonably believes that he or she is suspected or has been accused by OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act may obtain legal representation from DA. The counsel assigned will be from another DOD component whenever a DA attorney is likely to face a conflict between the attorney's ethical obligation to the client and DA, or when the suspected or accused individual has requested representation from another DOD component. Outside legal counsel may be retained by DA on behalf of the member or employee under unusual circumstances and only with the personal approval of the DOD General Counsel.</P>
                <P>c. The DA General Counsel will determine whether a conflict is likely to occur if a DA attorney is assigned to represent a military member or civilian. If the DA General Counsel determines a conflict may occur, or if the suspected or accused employee has requested representation from another DOD component, the DA General Counsel will seek the assistance of another General Counsel in obtaining representation outside DA.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Requests for Representation</HD>
                <P>a. To obtain legal representation, military members or civilian employees must—</P>
                <P>(1) Submit a written request for legal representation through the Labor and Employment Law Office, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Department of the Army, to DA General Counsel, explaining the circumstances that justify legal representation. Copies of all process and pleadings served should accompany the request.</P>
                <P>(2) Indicate whether private counsel, at personal expense, has been retained.</P>
                <P>(3) Obtain written certification from their supervisor that—</P>
                <P>(a) They were acting within the scope of official duties; and</P>
                <P>(b) DA has not initiated any adverse or disciplinary action against them for the conduct being investigated by the OSC.</P>
                <P>b. Requests for DA legal representation must be approved by the DA General Counsel.</P>
                <P>c. The conditions of legal representation must be explained and accepted in writing by the member or employee.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Limitations on Representation</HD>
                <P>a. DA will not provide legal representation with respect to a DA initiated disciplinary action against a civilian employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel practice or for engaging in illegal or improper conduct. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary action proposed by the OSC.</P>

                <P>b. In certain situations, counsel provided by DA may be limited to representing the individual only with respect to some of the pending matters, if other specific matters of concern to the OSC or MSPB do not satisfy the requirements contained in this regulation.<PRTPAGE P="135"/>

                <P>b. In representing a DA employee or military member, the DA attorney designated as counsel will act as a vigorous advocate of the individual's legal interests before the OSC or MSPB. The attorney's professional responsibility to DA will be satisfied by fulfilling this responsibility to the employee or military member. Legal representation may be terminated only with the approval of the DA General Counsel and normally only on the basis of information not available at the time the attorney was assigned.</P>
                <P>c. The attorney-client relationship may be terminated if the assigned DA counsel determines, with the approval of the DA General Counsel, that—</P>
                <P>(1) The military member or civilian employee was acting outside the scope of his or her official duties when engaging in the conduct that is the basis for the OSC investigation or charge; and</P>
                <P>(2) Termination is not in violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the assigned counsel.</P>
                <P>d. The DA attorney designated as counsel may request relief from the duties of representation or counseling without being required to furnish explanatory information that might compromise confidential communications between the client and the attorney.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Funding</HD>
                <P>This regulation authorizes cognizant DA officials to approve requests from military members or civilian employees for travel, per diem, witness appearances, or other departmental support necessary to ensure effective legal representation by the designated counsel.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Status</HD>
                <P>A military member's or civilian employee's participation in OSC investigations, MSPB hearings, and other related proceedings will be considered official departmental business for time and attendance requirements and similar purposes.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Advice to Witnesses</HD>
                <P>The following advice to military members and civilian employees questioned during the course of an OSC investigation may be appropriate in response to these frequent inquiries:</P>
                <P>a. A witness may decline to provide a “yes” or “no” answer in favor of a more qualified answer when this is necessary to ensure accuracy in responding to an OSC interviewer's question.</P>
                <P>b. Requests for clarification of both questions and answers are appropriate to avoid misinterpretation.</P>
                <P>c. Means to ensure verifications of an interview by OSC investigators are appropriate, whether or not the military member or civilian employee is accompanied by counsel. Tape recorders may only be used for this purpose when—</P>
                <P>(1) The recorder is used in full view.</P>
                <P>(2) All attendees are informed.</P>
                <P>(3) The OSC investigator agrees to record the proceeding.</P>
                <P>d. Any errors that appear in a written summary of an interview prepared by the investigator should be corrected before the member or employee signs the statement. The military member or civilian employee is not required to sign any written summary that is not completely accurate. A military member or civilian employee may receive a copy of the summary as a condition of signing.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Background and authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> (1) Certain areas, due to their strategic nature or for purposes of defense, have been subjected to restrictions regarding the free entry of persons, ships, and aircraft. Free entry into the areas listed and defined in this regulation, and military installations contiguous to or within the boundaries of defense site areas, is subject to control as provided for in the Executive Order 11021 of May 7, 1962 and Departments of Interior and Defense Agreement effective July 1, 1963, or other regulations. Such restrictions are imposed for defense purposes because of the unique strategic nature of the area and for the protection of the United States Government military bases, stations, facilities, and other installations, and the personnel, property, and equipment assigned to or located therein. Persons, ships, and aircraft are excluded from KMR unless and until they are granted permission to enter under applicable regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) The control of entry into or movement within KMR by persons, ships, or aircraft will be exercised so as to protect fully the physical security of, and insure the full effectiveness of, bases, stations, facilities, other installations, and individuals within KMR. However, unnecessary interference with the free movement of persons, ships, and aircraft is to be avoided.</P>
              <P>(3) This regulation will be administered to provide the prompt processing of all applications and to insure uniformity of interpretation and application insofar as changing conditions permit.</P>
              <P>(4) In cases of doubt, the determination will be made in favor of the course of action which will best serve the interests of the United States and national defense as distinguished from the private interests of an individual or group.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority.</E> (1) The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands is a strategic area administered by the United States under the provisions of the Trusteeship Agreement for the Former Japanese Mandated Islands, approved by the United Nations April 2, 1947. Congress, by 48 U.S.C. Sec. 1681, gave responsibility for this area to the President. By Executive Order 11021, the President delegated this authority to the Secretary of Interior. By agreement between the Secretary of Interior and Secretary of Defense, the Navy became responsible for all entry control July 1, 1963. With approval of the Secretary of Defense and Director of the Office of Territories, the authority to control entry into KMR was transferred to the Army in July of 1964.</P>
              <P>(2) The authority of the Department of the Army to control entry of persons, ships, and aircraft into Kwajalein Missile Range is exercised through the Commander, Ballistic Missile Defense Systems Command, who is the National Range Commander.</P>
              <P>(3) Penalties are provided by law for:</P>
              <P>(i) Violation of regulations imposed for the protection or security of military or naval aircraft, airports, air facilities, vessels, harbors, ports, piers, waterfront facilities, bases, forts, posts, laboratories, stations, vehicles, equipment, explosives, or other property or places subject to the jurisdiction of, administration of, or in the custody of the Department of Defense (sec. 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797) and Department of Defense Directive 5200.8 of 29 July 1980.</P>
              <P>(ii) Knowingly and willfully making a false or misleading statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States (18 U.S.C. 1001).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Entry authorizations may be issued only after the National Range Commander, the Commander, KMR, or a duly authorized subordinate has determined that the presence of the person, ship, or aircraft will not, under existing or reasonably forseeable future conditions, endanger, place an undue burden upon, or otherwise jeopardize the efficiency, capability or effectiveness of any military installation <PRTPAGE P="138"/>located within Kwajalein Missile Range or areas contiguous thereto. Factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to, the true purpose of the entry, the possible burdens or threats to the defense facilities which the presence of the ship, aircraft, or the individual or individuals involved impose or might reasonably be expected to impose on those islands in the Kwajalein Atoll under U.S. Army jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(2) Request for entry authorizations will be evaluated and adjudged as to whether the entry at the time and for the purpose stated will or will not be inimical to the purposes of U.S. national defense.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Aliens and permanent resident aliens.</E> (1) Entry of aliens for employment or residence (except as specified in paragraph 3-2.b.) in an area entirely within the borders of Kwajalein Missile Range is not authorized except when such entry would serve the interests of the U.S. Government, and then only for specified periods and under prescribed conditions. Entry application shall include the name and nationality of the person desiring entry.</P>
              <P>(2) Alien and immigrant spouses and dependents of U.S. citizen sponsors or principals assigned to Kwajalein Missile Range may be granted entry authorization by the National Range Commander so long as U.S. sponsor or principal remains on duty or resides within Kwajalein Missile Range.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Excluded persons.</E> Excluded persons, as defined in 1-3.e., are normally prohibited from entering Kwajalein Missile Range. Excluded persons may enter Kwajalein Missile Range only when a bona fide emergency exists and the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, grants permission for them to enter or transit the Kwajalein Missile Range. While they are within the jurisdiction of the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, they will be subject to such restrictions and regulations as he may impose.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unauthorized persons.</E> Persons not authorized to enter Kwajalein will not normally be allowed to debark from authorized ships or aircraft at Kwajalein Island or other islands in the Kwajalein Atoll to which the U.S. Government has lease rights, except that continuing aircraft passengers may be allowed at the discretion of the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, to debark during aircraft ground time to remain within specified portions of the terminal building designated by the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range. In emergency situations, entry of unauthorized personnel may be granted by the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Entrance to other areas of the Trust Territory.</E> No person, unless a citizen, national, or permanent resident alien of the Marshall Islands, will be permitted to debark at Kwajalein Missile Range for the purpose of transiting to areas under the jurisdiction of the Republic of the Marshall Islands without possessing a permit issued by its Chief of Immigration.

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Unauthorized marine vessels and aircraft.</E> No unauthorized marine vessel or aircraft shall enter Kwajalein Missile Range unless a bona fide emergency exists and the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, has granted such permission. The Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, shall use all means at his disposal to prevent unauthorized vessels and aircraft from entering Kwajalein Missile Range. Unauthorized marine vessels and aircraft will be seized for prosecution along with the crew, passengers, and cargo.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Entry authorization (procedure).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Processing.</E> (1) Upon receipt of an application, the appropriate officer (either the National Range Commander, the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range or the designated representative) shall take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) Determine that the entry of the applicant is, or is not, in accordance with the criteria set forth in chapter 3. After having made a determination, the reviewing authority shall either:</P>
              <P>(A) Issue an entry authorization as requested, or with modifications as circumstances require; or</P>
              <P>(B) Deny the request and advise the applicant of his/her right to appeal in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5-2.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the reviewing authority feels that additional information is required before reaching a decision, the reviewing authority will request that information from the applicant and then proceed as in paragraph 5-1.a.(1).</P>
              <P>(iii) If, after having obtained all pertinent information, the reviewing authority cannot reach a decision, he/she will forward the application to the next higher headquarters. A statement containing the following information shall accompany the application:</P>
              <P>(A) A summary of the investigation conducted by the reviewing organization.</P>
              <P>(B) The reason the application is being forwarded.</P>
              <P>(C) Appropriate comments and/or recommendations.</P>
              <P>(2) All applicants will be kept fully informed of actions/decisions pertaining to his/her application. Normally a response will be forwarded to the applicant within ten working days after receipt of an application. When the National Range Commander responds to an application, he/she will send a copy of that response to the Commander, KMR. When the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, responds to an application, and the National Range Commander has an interest in the visit, the Commander, KMR, will concurrently send a copy of that response to the National Range Commander.</P>
              <P>(3) Entry authorizations shall state the purpose for which the entry is authorized and such other information and conditions as are pertinent to the particular authorization.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Revocations.</E> (1) Entry authorizations may be revoked by the National Range Commander or the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, for misconduct, or termination of status, or upon being advised of the discovery of information which would have been grounds for denial of the initial request. Such a revocation will be confirmed in writing to the holder of an entry authorization. When an entry authorization is revoked, a one-way permit will be normally issued as appropriate, to permit the ship, aircraft, or person to depart the area.</P>
              <P>(2) When Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range revokes an entry authorization, he shall forward a copy of such revocation with supporting documentation to the National Range Commander.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> (1) Appeals from entry denial or revocation by Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range will be filed with the National Range Commander. An appeal shall contain a complete statement of the purpose of the proposed entry and a statement or reasons why the entry should be authorized, or why revocation of entry authorization should not be enforced.</P>
              <P>(2) Final appeal letters will be forwarded promptly by the National Range Commander to the BMD Program Manager with an indorsement setting forth in detail the facts and circumstances surrounding the action taken.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Renewals.</E> Entry authorizations having been granted and utilized may be extended or renewed upon request at <PRTPAGE P="142"/>the expiration of the period for which the entry was originally authorized or extended provided the justification for remaining in the area or for making a reentry meets the criteria set forth in this procedure. It shall be the responsibility of every applicant to depart Kwajalein Missile Range upon expiration of the time prescribed in the entry authorization, unless such authorization has been extended or renewed. Failure to comply herewith will be considered as evidence or violation of this procedure and may result in denial of future authorizations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This part applies to court reporters and interpreters appointed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 28 (10 U.S.C. 828), and witnesses both in Government employ and those not in Government employ when subpoenaed to appear before a court.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of term “court”.</E> The term “court” as used in this part will be construed to include court-martial, court of inquiry, military commission, or retiring board. “Military commission” includes any United States tribunal, by whatever name described, convened in the exercise of military government, martial law, or the laws of war.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 534.2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Allowable expenses for reporters.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Reporters appointed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 28, are entitled to payment for their services in such capacity at the rates specified in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section, or at such lower rates as may be stated in the appointing instrument.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Per diem pay.</E> A reporter is entitled to a per diem payment of not to exceed $5 for each day or fraction thereof in attendance at court. Only one such payment is authorized for any 1 day even if the reporter attends two or more courts. For the purpose of this payment, the day ends at midnight and any fraction will be considered a whole day.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Hourly pay.</E> A reporter is entitled to an hourly payment of not to exceed 50 cents for each hour, or fractional part equal to or greater than one-half hour, actually spent in court during the trial or hearing. A fractional part of an hour, less than one-half hour, will be disregarded, except that if the total time in attendance in one day or at one court in one day is less than 1 hour, such time will be considered as 1 hour. Time will be computed separately for each day if only one court is attended in such day. If more than one court is attended in 1 day, time in attendance at each court will be computed separately. The hourly pay is in addition to the per diem prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Piece-work pay</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rates.</E> In addition to per diem and hourly pay prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a reporter will be paid on a piece-work basis for transcribing notes and copy work based on the following rates:</P>
              <P>(i) Transcribing notes and making that portion of the original record which is required to be typewritten—25 cents for each 100 words.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each carbon copy of the record when authorized by the convening authority—10 cents for each 100 words.</P>
              <P>(iii) Copying papers material to the inquiry—15 cents for each 100 words.</P>
              <P>(iv) Each carbon copy of the papers referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section when ordered by the court for its use—2 cents for each 100 words.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Counting number of words.</E> The certifying officer may determine the total number of words by counting the words on a sufficient number of pages to arrive at a fair average of words per page and multiplying such average by the total number of pages. Abbreviations “Q” and “A” for “Questions” and “Answer” and all dates such as “25th” and “1957” will each be counted as one word. Punctuation marks will not be counted as words.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Mileage.</E> A reporter is entitled to 8 cents a mile for travel from his home or usual place of employment to the court and for his return journey, computed on the basis of the Rand McNally <PRTPAGE P="144"/>Standard Highway Mileage Guide. Mileage is not authorized for return trips each night unless the sessions of the court are held on nonconsecutive days. The fact that a reporter may serve two or more courts in the same day does not warrant a duplication of his mileage allowance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Allowance in lieu of subsistence</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> When the official of the court having control in such matters keeps the reporter at his own expense away from his usual place of employment for 24 hours or more on public business referred to the court, a per diem allowance of not to exceed $4 in lieu of subsistence will be paid to the reporter for himself. A like allowance when ordered by the court will be paid to the reporter for each necessary assistant. The fact that a reporter returns each night to his home does not preclude the view that he is kept away from his usual place of employment for 24 hours. Service as reporter before two or more courts in the same day does not warrant duplication of the per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computation.</E> The time for which the per diem allowance for expenses is to be paid will be computed in the manner prescribed in § 534.3(b)(3) for a civilian witness not in Government employ.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Allowance for constructive attendance.</E> A reporter duly employed but who after arrival at court performs no service because of adjournment is entitled to mileage; to a day's pay as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section; and also to the per diem allowance prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section if kept away from his usual place of employment for 24 hours.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Detail of enlisted members.</E> Enlisted members may be detailed to serve as stenographic reporters for military courts, boards, and commissions, but will receive no extra pay for such service.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Persons receiving pay from Government.</E> Compensation for clerical duties performed for a court will not be paid to a person who is in the pay of the Government, except retired military members to the extent permitted under the dual compensation laws.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Military members</E>—(1) <E T="03">On active duty.</E> Members in the military service, on active duty, when required to appear as witnesses before courts will receive the appropriate travel and transportation allowances prescribed in chapter 4, Joint Travel Regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Retired members.</E> Retired military members, not on active duty, when called as witnesses (other than expert witnesses), are entitled for their services as such to the mileage and other fees prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for civilian witnesses not in Government employ.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Civilians</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) Persons not subject to military law when called as witnesses are entitled to the fees and mileage allowed to wintesses attending courts of the United States.

              <P>(ii) When the court is sitting in a foreign country, the oversea commander within whose command the court is convened will fix fees and allowances to be paid to witnesses, not in excess of maximum rates permitted to witnesses attending the courts of the United States or the courts of the foreign country, whichever rates may be higher.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">In Government employ.</E> Any officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof, summoned as a witness on behalf of the United States, shall be paid his necessary expenses incident to travel by common carrier, or, if travel is made by privately owned automobile, mileage at a rate not to exceed 10 cents per mile, together with a per diem allowance not to exceed the rate of $12 a day.

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Not in Government employ</E>—(i) <E T="03">Excluding Alaska and Canal Zone.</E> A witness attending in any court of the United States or before a United States commissioner or person taking his deposition pursuant to any order of the court of the United States, will receive $4 for each day's attendance and for the time necessarily occupied in going to <PRTPAGE P="145"/>and returning from the same, and 8 cents per mile for going from and returning to his place of residence. Witnesses who are not salaried employees of the Government and who are not in custody and who attend at point so far removed from their respective residences as to prohibit return thereto from day to day will be entitled to an additional allowance of $8 per day for expenses of subsistence including the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the place of attendance. In lieu of the mileage allowance provided for herein, witnesses who are required to travel between the Territories, possessions, or to and from the continental United States, will be entitled to the actual expenses of travel at the lowest first-class rate available at the time of reservation for passage, by means of transportation employed. When a witness is detained in prison for want of security for his appearance, he will be entitled, in addition to his subsistence, to a compensation of $1 a day.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">In Alaska and Canal Zone.</E> (<E T="03">a</E>) In Alaska such witnesses are entitled to the witness fees and mileage prescribed for witnesses before the United States district court in the judicial division in which the trial or hearing is held. Fees vary in the different judicial divisions.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) In the Canal Zone such witnesses are entitled to the witness fees and mileage as are prescribed for witnesses before the United States court in the Canal Zone.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Responsible officers in Alaska and in the Panama Canal Zone will keep informed as to the fees payable in United States courts in those places.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mileage</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A civilian witness not in Government employ, when furnished transportation in kind by the Government, is entitled to 8 cents per mile less the cost of transportation furnished. A civilian witness residing within the jurisdiction of the court, who is subpoenaed and attends the trial in obedience to such subpoena, is entitled to mileage between his residence and the place of trial, regardless of whether both are in the same city.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computation.</E> Mileage at the rate of 8 cents per mile will be computed on the basis of the Rand McNally Standard Highway Mileage Guide regardless of the mode of transportation used.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Subsistence per diem allowance</E>—(1) <E T="03">When payable.</E> The subsistence per diem allowance is payable only when the place of trial is so far removed from the place of residence as to prohibit return of the witness thereto from day to day and such fact is properly certified. (See 6 Comp. Gen. 835.)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computation.</E> In computing the subsistence per diem allowance prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the calendar day beginning at midnight is the unit, and the subsistence per diem allowance accrues from the time it is necessary for the witness to leave his home in order to arrive at the place of trial at the appointed time until the time he could arrive at his home by first available transportation after his discharge from attendance, any fractional part of a day under such transportation to be regarded as a day for per diem purposes. (See 5 Comp. Gen. 1028, as modified by 6 Comp. Gen. 480 and 6 id. 835.)</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Attendance fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Attendance at more than one case on same day.</E> A person attending as a witness in more than one case on the same day under a general subpoena to appear and testify is entitled to only one per diem for each day's attendance. If separate subpoenas are issued in each case, the defendants being different, the witness is entitled to separate per diem for actual attendance in each case. The duplication of fees on account of attendance as witness in more than one case on the same day does not apply to the 8-cent mileage allowance and does not apply to the per diem on $8 in lieu of subsistence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Attendance before officer taking deposition.</E> A witness who is required to appear before an officer (civil or military) empowered to take depositions and there to give testimony under oath to be used before a court is entitled for such service and for the necessary travel incident thereto, including return travel, to the allowances prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the same as though his appearance were before a court. (See 8 Comp. Gen. 18.)</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Attendance before military courts or boards of limited jurisdiction.</E> A subpoena <PRTPAGE P="146"/>or other compulsory process addressed to a civilian by a military court or board which has not express statutory authority to issue such process, such as a board of officers convened to investigate and report upon the facts connected with the death of an enlisted member while on temporary duty, is void. Civilian witnesses who appear before such a board in response to such void process must be regarded as having done so voluntarily and are not entitled to witness fees, in the absence of a specific appropriation therefor. (See 8 Comp. Gen. 64.)</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Computation.</E> The provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section are equally applicable for computation of the attendance fee.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Expert</E>—(1) <E T="03">Fees paid.</E> An expert witness employed in accordance with Manual for Courts-Martial, 1951, paragraph 116, may be paid compensation at the rate prescribed in advance by the official empowered to authorize his employment. (See 11 Comp. Gen. 504.) In the absence of such advance authorization no fees, other than ordinary witness fees, may be paid for the employment of an individual as an expert witness. (See paragraph 116, Manual for Courts-Martial (Executive Order 10214).)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> (i) An expert while employed on behalf of the Government is an officer or employee of the United States within the laws affecting traveling and subsistence expenses of officers and employees of the Government generally.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Operations of claims processing offices</E>—(1) <E T="03">Claims processing office with approval authority.</E> A CPO that has been granted approval authority must provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction, on an area, command, or agency basis, and for the adjudication and payment of all claims presented within its monetary jurisdiction. If the estimated value of a claim, after investigation, exceeds the CPO's payment authority, or if disapproval is the appropriate action, the claim file will be forwarded to the ACO unless otherwise specified in this part, or forwarded to USARCS or the command claims service, if directed by such service.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Claims processing offices without approval authority.</E> A CPO that has not been granted claims approval authority will provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction on an area, command, or agency basis. Once the investigation has been completed, the claim file will be forwarded to the appropriate ACO for action. Alternatively, an ACO may direct the transfer of a claim investigation from a CPO without approval authority to another CPO with approval authority, located within the ACO's jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Medical claims processing offices.</E> The MCJAs or medical claims attorneys at Army medical centers, other than Walter Reed Army Medical Center, may be designated by the SJA or head of the ACO for the installation on which the center is located as CPOs with approval authority for medical malpractice claims only. Claims for amounts exceeding a medical CPO's approval authority will be investigated and forwarded to the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Special claims processing offices</E>—(i) <E T="03">Designation and authority.</E> The Commander USARCS, the chief of a command claims service, or the head of an ACO may designate special CPOs within his or her command for specific, short-term purposes (for example, maneuvers, civil disturbances and emergencies). These special CPOs may be delegated the approval authority necessary to effect the purpose of their creation, but in no case will this delegation exceed the maximum monetary approval authority set forth in other subparts of this part for regular CPOs. All claims will be processed under the claims expenditure allowance and claims command and office code of the authority that established the office or under a code assigned by USARCS. The existence of any special CPO must be reported to the Commander USARCS, and the chief of a command claims service, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Maneuver damage and claims office jurisdiction.</E> A special CPO is the proper organization to process and approve maneuver damage claims, except when a foreign government is responsible for adjudication pursuant to an international agreement (see subpart G of this part). Personnel from the maneuvering command should be used to investigate claims and, at the ACO's discretion, may be assigned to the special CPO. The ACO will process claims filed after the maneuver terminates. The special CPO will investigate claims <PRTPAGE P="158"/>arising while units are traveling to or from the maneuver within the jurisdiction of other ACOs, and forward such claims for action to the ACO in whose area the claims arose. Claims for damage to real or personal property arising on private land that the Army has used under a permit may be paid from funds specifically budgeted by the maneuver for such purposes in accordance with AR 405-15.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Disaster claims and civil disturbance.</E> A special CPO provided for a disaster or civil disturbance should include a claims approving authority with adequate investigatory, administrative, and logistical support, including damage assessment and finance and accounting support. It will not be dispatched prior to notification of the Commander USARCS, whose concurrence must be obtained before the first claim is paid.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Supervisory requirements.</E> The CPOs discussed in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section must be supervised by an assigned CJA or claims attorney in order to exercise delegated approval authority.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 536.15</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Claims policies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The following policies will be adhered to in processing and adjudicating claims falling within this regulation. The Commander USARCS is authorized to publish new policies or rescind existing policies from time to time as the need arises.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The Commander USARCS must be notified as soon as possible of both potential and actual claims which are serious incidents that cannot be settled within the monetary jurisdiction of a Command Claims Service or an ACO, including those which occur in the area of responsibility of a CPO. On such claims, the USARCS Area Action Officer (AAO) must coordinate with the field office as to all aspects of the investigation, evaluation and determination of liability. An offer of settlement or the assertion of an affirmative claim must be the result of a discussion between the AAO and the field office. Payment of a subrogated claim may commit the United States to liability as to larger claims. On the other hand, where all claims out of an incident can be paid within field authority they should be paid promptly with maximum use of small claims procedures.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Consideration under all subparts.</E> Prior to denial, a claim will be considered under all subparts of this part, regardless of the form on which the claim is presented. A claim presented as a personnel claim will be considered as a tort prior to denial. A claim presented as a tort will first be considered as a personnel claim, and if not payable, then considered as a tort. If deniable, the claim will be denied both as a personnel claim and as a tort.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Compromise.</E> DA policy seeks to compromise claims in a manner that represents a fair and equitable result to both the claimant and the United States. This policy does not extend to frivolous claims or claims lacking factual or legal merit. A claim should not be settled solely to avoid further processing time and expense. All claims, regardless of amount, should be evaluated. Congress imposed no minimum limit on payable claims nor did it intend that small non-meritous claims be paid. Practically any claim, regardless of amount, may be subject to compromise through direct negotiation. A CJA or claims attorney should develop expertise in assessing liability and damages, including small property damage claims. For example, a property damage claim may be compromised by deducting the cost of collection, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, attorney fees and costs, even where liability is certain.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Expeditious processing at the lowest level.</E> Claims investigation and adjudication should be accomplished at the lowest possible level, such as the CPO or ACO that has monetary authority over the estimated total value of all claims arising from the incident. The expeditious investigation and settlement of claims is essential to successfully fulfilling the Army's responsibilities under the claims statutes implemented by this part.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice to claimants of technical errors in claim.</E> When technical errors are found in a claim's filing or contents, claimants should be advised of such errors and the need to correct the claim. If the errors concern a jurisdictional matter, a record should be maintained and the claimant should be immediately warned that the error must be corrected before the statute of limitations (SOL) expires.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cooperative investigative environment.</E> Any person who indicates a desire to file a claim against the United States cognizable under one of the subparts of this part will be instructed concerning the procedure to follow. The claimant will be furnished claim forms and, when necessary, assisted in completing claim forms, and may be <PRTPAGE P="160"/>assisted in assembling evidence. Claims personnel may not assist any claimant in determining what amount to claim. During claims investigation, every effort should be made to create a cooperative environment that engenders the free exchange of information and evidence. The goal of obtaining sufficient information to make an objective and fair analysis should be paramount. Personal contact with claimants or their representatives is essential both during investigation and before adjudication. When settlement is not feasible, issues in dispute should be clearly identified to facilitate resolution of any reconsideration, appeal or litigation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims directives and plans</E>—(1) <E T="03">Directives.</E> Two copies of command claims directives will be furnished to the Commander USARCS. ACO directives will be distributed to all DA and DOD commands, installations and activities within the ACO's area of responsibility, with an information copy to the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Disaster and civil preparedness plan.</E> One copy of all ACOs' disaster or civil disturbance plans or annexes will be furnished to the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Interpretations.</E> The Commander USARCS will publish written interpretations of this part. Interpretations will have the same force and effect as this part.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Authority to grant exceptions to and deviations from this part.</E> If, in particular instances, it is considered to be in the best interests of the government, the Commander USARCS may authorize deviations from this part's specific requirements, except as to matters based on statutes, treaties and international agreements, executive orders, controlling directives of the Attorney General or Comptroller General, or other publications that have the force and effect of law.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> The Commander USARCS, may publish bulletins, manuals, handbooks and notes, and a DA Pamphlet that provides guidance to claims authorities on administrative and procedural rules implementing this part. These will be binding on all Army claims personnel.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Communication.</E> All claims personnel are authorized to communicate directly with USARCS personnel for guidance on matters of policy or on matters relating to the implementation of this part.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Private relief bills.</E> The issue of a private relief bill is one between a claimant and his or her Congressional representative. There is no established procedure under which the DA sponsors private relief legislation. Claims personnel shall remain neutral in all private relief matters and shall not make any statement that purports to reflect the DA's position on a private relief bill.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Release of information policies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Conflict of interest.</E> Except as part of their official duties, government personnel are forbidden from advising or representing claimants or from receiving any payment or gratuity for services rendered. They may not accept any share or interest in a claim or assist in its presentation, under penalty of federal criminal law (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Release of information.</E> (1) Relevant statutes pertinent to the release of information include the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a and 552b, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. 1320d through 1320d-8.</P>
                <P>(2) It is the policy of USARCS that unclassified attorney work product may be released with or without a request from the claimant or attorney, whenever such release may help settle the claim or avoid unnecessary litigation.</P>

                <P>(3) A statutory exemption or privilege may not be waived. Similarly, documents subject to such statutorily required nondisclosure, exemption, or privilege may not be released. Regarding other exemptions and privileges, authorities may waive such exemptions or privileges and direct release of the protected documents, upon balancing all pertinent factors, including finding that release of protected records will not harm the government's interest, will promote settlement of a claim and will avoid unnecessary litigation, or for other good cause.<PRTPAGE P="161"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) All requests for records and information made pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552, the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or HIPAA, 42 U.S.C. 1320d, will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in AR 25-55 and AR 340-21, respectively as well as 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, DODD 6025.18-R, this part, and DA Pam 27-162.</P>
                <P>(i) Any request for DOD records that either explicitly or implicitly cites the FOIA shall be processed under the provisions of AR 25-55. Requests for DOD records submitted by a claimant or claimant's attorney will be processed under both the FOIA and under the Privacy Act when the request is made by the subject of the records requested and those records are maintained in a system of records. Such requests will be processed under the FOIA time limits and the Privacy Act fee provisions. Withheld information must be exempt from disclosure under both Acts.</P>
                <P>(ii) Requests that cite both Acts or neither Act are processed under both Acts, using the FOIA time limits and the Privacy Act fee provisions. For further guidance, see AR 25-55, paragraphs 1-301 and 1-503.</P>
                <P>(5) The following records may not be disclosed:</P>
                <P>(i) Medical quality assurance records exempt from disclosure pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1102(a).</P>
                <P>(ii) Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to appropriate balancing tests under FOIA exemption (6) (clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy), exemption (7)(c) (reasonably constitutes unwarranted invasion of privacy), and law enforcement records (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)) unless requested by the subject of the record.</P>
                <P>(iii) Records protected by the Privacy Act.</P>
                <P>(iv) Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA exemption (1) (National security) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), unless such records have been properly declassified.</P>
                <P>(v) Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege under FOIA exemption (5) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), unless the client consents to the disclosure.</P>
                <P>(6) Records within a category for which withholding of the record is discretionary (AR 25-55, paragraph 3-101), such as exemptions under the deliberative process or attorney work product privileges (exemption (5) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) may be released when there is no foreseeable harm to government interests in the judgment of the releasing authority.</P>
                <P>(7) When it is determined that exempt information should not be released, or a question as to its releaseability exists, forward the request and two copies of the responsive documents to the Commander USARCS. The Commander USARCS, acting on behalf of TJAG (the initial denial authority), may deny release of records processed under the FOIA only. The Commander USARCS, will forward to TJAG all such requests processed under both the FOIA and PA. TJAG is the denial authority for Privacy Act requests (AR 340-21, paragraph 1-7i).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims assistance.</E> In the vicinity of a field exercise, maneuver or disaster, claims personnel may disseminate information on the right to present claims, procedures to be followed, and the names and location of claims officers and the COE repair teams. When the government of a foreign country in which U.S. Armed Forces are stationed has assumed responsibility for the settlement of certain claims against the United States, officials of that country will be furnished as much pertinent information and evidence as security considerations permit.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims investigative responsibility—General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This subpart addresses the investigation, processing, evaluation, and settlement of tort and tort-related claims for and against the United States. The provisions of this subpart do not apply to personnel claims (AR <PRTPAGE P="163"/>27-20, chapter 11), or to claims under subpart G of this part, §§ 536.114 through 536.116.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cooperation.</E> Claims investigation requires team effort between the U.S. Army Claims Service (USARCS), command claims services, and area claims offices (ACOs) including U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) District Offices, claims processing offices (CPOs), and unit claims officers. Essential to this effort is the immediate investigation of claims incidents. Prompt investigation depends on the timely reporting of claims incidents as well as continuous communication between all commands or echelons bearing claims responsibility.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification to USARCS.</E> A CPO or an ACO receiving notice of a potentially compensable event (PCE) that requires investigation will immediately refer it to the appropriate claims office. The Commander USARCS will be notified of all major incidents involving serious injury or death or those in which property damage exceeds $50,000. A command claims service may delegate to an ACO the responsibility for advising USARCS of serious incidents and complying with mirror file requirements. A copy of the written delegation and any changes made thereafter will be forwarded to the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Geographic concept of responsibility.</E> A command claims service or an ACO in whose geographic area a claims incident occurs is primarily responsible for initiating investigation and processing of any claim filed in the absence of a formal transfer of responsibility (see §§ 536.30 through 536.36). DOD and Army organizations whose personnel are involved in the incident will cooperate with and assist the ACO, regardless of where the former may be located.

                <SUBJECT>Identifying claims incidents both for and against the government.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Investigation is required when:</P>
                <P>(1) There is property loss or damage.</P>
                <P>(i) Property other than that belonging to the government is damaged, lost, or destroyed by an act or omission of a government employee or a member of North Atlantic Treaty Association (NATO), Australian or Singaporean forces stationed or on temporary duty within the United States.</P>
                <P>(ii) Property belonging to the government is damaged or lost by a tortious act or omission not covered by the report of survey system or by a carrier's bill of lading.</P>
                <P>(2) There is personal injury or death.</P>
                <P>(i) A civilian other than an employee of the U.S. government is injured or killed by an act or omission of a government employee or by a member of a NATO, Australian or Singaporean force stationed or on temporary duty within the United States. (This category includes patients injured during treatment by a health care provider).</P>
                <P>(ii) Service members, active or retired, family members of either, or U.S. employees, are injured or killed by a third party and receive medical care at government expense.</P>
                <P>(3) A claim is filed.</P>
                <P>(4) A competent authority or another armed service or federal agency requires investigation.</P>
                <P>(b) Determining who is a government employee is a matter of federal, not local, law. Categories of government employees usually accepted as tortfeasors under federal law are:</P>
                <P>(1) Military personnel (soldiers of the Army, or members of other services where the Army exercises single-service jurisdiction on foreign soil; and soldiers or employees within the United States who are members of NATO or of other foreign military forces with whom the United States has a reciprocal claims agreement and whose sending States have certified that they were acting within the scope of their duty) who are serving on full-time active duty in a pay status, including soldiers:</P>
                <P>(i) Assigned to units performing active or inactive duty.</P>
                <P>(ii) Serving on active duty as Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) instructors.</P>
                <P>(iii) Serving as Army National Guard (ARNG) instructors or advisors.</P>

                <P>(iv) On duty or training with other federal agencies, for example: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of State, the Navy, the Air Force, or DOD (federal <PRTPAGE P="164"/>agencies other than the armed service to which the Soldier is attached may also provide a remedy).</P>
                <P>(v) Assigned as students or ordered into training at a non-federal civilian educational institution, hospital, factory, or other facility (excluding soldiers on excess leave or those for whom the training institution or organization has assumed liability by written agreement).</P>
                <P>(vi) Serving on full-time duty at nonappropriated fund (NAF) activities.</P>
                <P>(vii) Of the United States Army Reserve (USAR) and ARNG on active duty under Title 10, U.S.C.</P>
                <P>(2) Military personnel who are United States Army Reserve soldiers including ROTC cadets who are Army Reserve soldiers while at annual training, during periods of active duty and inactive duty training.</P>
                <P>(3) Military personnel who are soldiers of the ARNG while engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or engaged in properly authorized community action projects under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), the Non-Scope Claims Act (NSCA), or the National Guard Claims Act (NGCA), unless performing duties in furtherance of a mission for a state, commonwealth, territory or possession.</P>
                <P>(4) Civilian officials and employees of both the DOD and DA (there is no practical significance to the distinction between the terms “official” and “employee”), including but not limited to the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Civil service and other full-time employees of both the DOD and DA who are paid from appropriated funds.</P>
                <P>(ii) Persons providing direct health care services pursuant to personal service contracts under 10 U.S.C. 1089 or 1091 or where another person exercised control over the health care provider's day-to-day practice. When the conduct of a health care provider performing services under a personal service contract is implicated in a claim, the CJA, Medical Claims Judge Advocate (MCJA), or claims attorney should consult with USARCS to determine if that health care provider can be considered an employee for purposes of coverage.</P>
                <P>(iii) Employees of a NAF instrumentality (NAFI) if it is an instrumentality of the United States and thus a federal agency. To determine whether a NAFI is a “federal agency,” consider both whether it is an integral part of the Army charged with an essential DA operational function and also what degree of control and supervision DA personnel exercise over it. Members or users, unlike employees of NAFIs, are not considered government employees; the same is true of family child care providers. However, claims arising out of the use of some NAFI property or from the acts or omissions of family child care providers may be payable from such funds under subpart K of this part as a matter of policy, even when the user is not acting within the scope of employment and the claim is not otherwise cognizable under any of the other authorities described in this part.</P>
                <P>(5) Prisoners of war and interned enemy aliens.</P>
                <P>(6) Civilian employees of the District of Columbia ARNG, including those paid under “service contracts” from District of Columbia funds.</P>
                <P>(7) Civilians serving as ROTC instructors paid from federal funds.</P>
                <P>(8) ARNG technicians employed under 32 U.S.C. 709(a) for claims accruing on or after January 1, 1969 (Public Law 90-486, August 13, 1968 (82 Stat. 755)), unless performing duties solely in pursuit of a mission for a state, commonwealth, territory or possession.</P>
                <P>(9) Persons acting in an official capacity for the DOD or DA either temporarily or permanently with or without compensation, including but not limited to the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Dollar-a-year personnel.</P>
                <P>(ii) Members of advisory committees, commissions, or boards.</P>

                <P>(iii) Volunteers serving in an official capacity in furtherance of the business of the United States, limited to those categories set forth in DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-45.

                <SUBJECT>Delegation of investigative responsibility.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Area Claims Office.</E> An ACO is authorized to carry out its investigative responsibility as follows:<PRTPAGE P="165"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) At the request of the area claims authority, commanders and heads of Army and DOD units, activities, or components will appoint a commissioned, warrant, or noncommissioned officer or a qualified civilian employee to investigate a claims incident in the manner set forth in DA Pam 27-162 and this part. An ACO will direct such investigation to the extent deemed necessary.</P>
                <P>(2) CPOs are responsible for investigating claims incidents arising out of the activities and operations of their command or agency. An ACO may assign area jurisdiction to a CPO after coordination with the appropriate commander to investigate claims incidents arising in the ACO's designated geographic area. (See § 536.3(f).)</P>
                <P>(3) Claims incidents involving patients arising from treatment by a health care provider in an Army medical treatment facility (MTF), including providers defined in 536.23(b)(4)(ii), will be investigated by a claims judge advocate (CJA), medical claims judge advocate (MCJA), or claims attorney rather than by a unit claims officer.</P>
                <P>(4) An ACO will publish and distribute a claims directive to all DOD and Army installations and activities including active, Army Reserve, and ARNG units as well as units located on the post at which the ACO is located. The directive will outline each installations' and activities' claims responsibilities. It will institute a serious claims incident reporting system.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Command claims service responsibility.</E> A command claims service is responsible for the investigation and processing of claims incidents arising in its geographic area of responsibility or for any incidents within the authority of any foreign claims commission (FCC) it appoints. This responsibility will be carried out by an ACO or a CPO to the extent possible. A command claims service will publish a claims directive outlining the geographic areas of claims investigative responsibilities of each of its installations and activities, requiring each ACO or CPO to report all serious claims incidents directly to the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">USARCS responsibility.</E> USARCS exercises technical supervision over all claims offices, providing guidance on specific cases throughout the claims process, including the method of investigation. Where indicated, USARCS may investigate a claims incident that normally falls within a command claims services', an ACO's, or a CPO's jurisdiction. USARCS typically acts through an area action officer (AAO) who is assigned as the primary point of contact with command claims services, ACOs or CPOs within a given geographic area. In areas outside the United States and its commonwealths, territories and possessions, where there is no command claims service or ACO, USARCS is responsible for investigation and for appointment of FCCs.

                <P>All ACOs and CPOs will institute procedures to ensure that potential claimants or attorneys speak to a CJA, claims attorney, investigator, or examiner. On initial contact, claims personnel will render assistance, discuss all aspects of the potential claim, and determine what statutes or procedures apply. Assistance will be furnished to the extent set forth in DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-4.

                <SECTNO>§ 536.26</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Identification of a proper claim.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) A claim is a writing that contains a sum certain for each claimant and that is signed by each claimant, or by an authorized representative, who must furnish written authority to sign on a claimant's behalf. The writing must contain enough information to permit investigation. The writing must be received not later than two years from the date the claim accrues. A claim under the Foreign Claims Act (FCA) may be presented orally to either the United States or the government of the foreign country in which the incident occurred, within two years, provided that it is reduced to writing not later than three years from the date of accrual. A claim may be transmitted by facsimile or telegram. <PRTPAGE P="166"/>However, a copy of an original claim must be submitted as soon as possible.</P>
                <P>(b) Where a claim is only for property damage and it is filed under circumstances where there might be injuries, the CJA should inquire if the claimant desires to split the claim as discussed in § 536.60.</P>
                <P>(c) Normally, a claim will be presented on a Standard Form (SF) 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death). When the claim is not presented on an SF 95, the claimant will be requested to complete an SF 95 to ease investigation and processing.</P>
                <P>(d) If a claim names two claimants and states only one sum certain, the claimants will be requested to furnish a sum certain for each. A separate sum certain must be obtained prior to payment under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), Military Claims Act (MCA), National Guard Claims Act (NGCA) or the FCA. The Financial Management Service will only pay an amount above the threshold amount of $2,500 for the FTCA, or $100,000 for the other statutes.</P>
                <P>(e) A properly filed claim meeting the definition of “claim” in paragraph (a) of this section tolls the two-year statute of limitations (SOL) even though the documents required to substantiate the claim are not present, such as those listed on the back of an SF 95 or in the Attorney General's regulations implementing the FTCA, 28 CFR 14.1—14.11. However, refusal to provide such documents may lead to dismissal of a subsequent suit under the FTCA or denial of a claim under other subparts of this part.</P>
                <P>(f) Receipt of a claim by another federal agency does not toll the SOL. Receipt of a U.S. Army claim by DOD, Navy, or Air Force does toll the SOL.</P>

                <P>(g) The guidelines set forth in federal FTCA case law will apply to other subparts of this part in determining whether a proper claim was filed.

                <SUBJECT>Identification of a proper claimant.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following are proper claimants:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Claims for property loss or damage.</E> A claim may be presented by the owner of the property or by a duly authorized agent or legal representative in the owner's name. As used in this part, the term “owner” includes the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">For real property.</E> The mortgagor, mortgagee, executor, administrator, or personal representative, if he or she may maintain a cause of action in the local courts involving a tort to the specific property, is a proper claimant. When notice of divided interests in real property is received, the claim should if feasible be treated as a single claim and a release from all interests must be obtained. This includes both the owner and tenant where both claim.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">For personal property.</E> A claim may be presented by a bailee, lessee, mortgagee, conditional vendor, or others holding title for purposes of security only, unless specifically prohibited by the applicable subpart. When notice of divided interests in personal property is received, the claim should if feasible be treated as a single claim; a release from all interests must be obtained. Property loss is defined as loss of actual tangible property, not consequential damage resulting from such loss.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Claims for personal injury or wrongful death</E>—(1) <E T="03">For personal injury.</E> A claim may be presented by the injured person or by a duly authorized agent or legal representative or, where the claimant is a minor, by a parent or a person in loco parentis. However, determine whether the claimant is a proper claimant under applicable state law or, if considered under the MCA, under § 536.77. If not, the claimant should be so informed in the acknowledgment letter and requested to withdraw the claim. If not withdrawn, deny the claim without delay. An example is a claim filed on behalf of a minor for loss of consortium for injury to a parent where not permitted by state law. Personal injury claims deriving from the principal injury may be presented by other parties. A claim may not be presented by a “volunteer,” meaning one who has no legal or contractual obligation, yet voluntarily pays damages on behalf of an injured party and then seeks reimbursement for their economic damages by filing a claim. See paragraph (f) (3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">For wrongful death.</E> A claim may be presented by the executor or administrator of the deceased's estate, or by <PRTPAGE P="167"/>any person determined to be legally or beneficially entitled under applicable local law. The amount allowed will be apportioned, to the extent practicable, among the beneficiaries in accordance with the law applicable to the incident. Under the MCA (subpart C of this part), only one wrongful death claim is authorized (see § 536.77(c)(1)(i)). Under subparts D and H of this part, a claim by the insured for property damage may be considered as a claim by the insurer as the real party in interest provided the insured has been reimbursed by the insurer and the insurance information is listed on the SF 95. The insurer should be required to file a separate SF 95 for payment purposes even though the SOL has expired. Where the insurance information is not listed on the SF 95 and the insured is paid by the United States, the payment of the insurer is the responsibility of the insured even though the insurer subsequently files a timely claim. To avoid this situation, always inquire as to the status of any insurance prior to payment of a property damage claim.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">By an agent or legal representative.</E> A claimant's agent or legal representative who presents a claim will do so in the claimant's name and sign the form in such a way that indicates the agent's or legal representative's title or capacity. When a claim is presented by an agent or legal representative:</P>
                <P>(1) It must contain written evidence of the agent's or legal representative's authority to sign, such as a power of attorney, or</P>
                <P>(2) It must refer to or cite the statute granting authority.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Subrogation.</E> A claim may be presented by the subrogee in his or her own name if authorized by the law of the place where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred, under subpart D or H of this part only. A lienholder is not a proper claimant and should be distinguished from a subrogee to avoid violation of the Antiassignment Act. See paragraph (f) of this section. However, liens arising under Medicare will be processed directly with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Systems. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-57g and h and 2-58.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Contribution or indemnity.</E> A claim may be filed for contribution or indemnification by the party who was held liable as a joint tortfeasor where authorized by state law. Such a claim is not perfected until payment has been made by the claimant/joint tortfeasor. A claim filed for contribution prior to payment being made should be considered as an opportunity to share a settlement where the United States is liable.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfer or assignment.</E> (1) Under the Antiassignment Act (31 U.S.C. 3727) and Defense Finance and Accounting Service—Indianpolis (DFAS-IN) regulation 37-1, a transfer or assignment is null and void except where it occurs by operation of law or after a voucher for the payment has been issued. The following are null and void:</P>
                <P>(i) Every purported transfer or assignment of a claim against the United States, or any interest, in whole or in part, on a claim, whether absolute or conditional; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Every power of attorney or other purported authority to receive payment for all or part of any such claim.</P>
                <P>(2) The Antiassignment Act was enacted to eliminate multiple payment of claims, to cause the United States to deal only with original parties and to prevent persons of influence from purchasing claims against the United States.</P>
                <P>(3) In general, this statute prohibits voluntary assignments of claims, with the exception of transfers or assignments made by operation of law. The operation of law exception has been held to apply to claims passing to assignees because of bankruptcy proceedings, assignments for the benefit of creditors, corporate liquidations, consolidations, or reorganizations, and where title passes by operation of law to heirs or legatees. Subrogated claims that arise under a statute are not barred by the Antiassignment Act. For example, subrogated workers' compensation claims are cognizable when presented by the insurer under subpart D or H of this part, but not other subparts.</P>

                <P>(4) Subrogated claims that arise pursuant to contractual provisions may be paid to the subrogee, if the legal basis for the subrogated claim is recognized by state statute or case law, only under <PRTPAGE P="168"/>subpart D or H of this part. For example, an insurer that issues an insurance policy becomes subrogated to the rights of a claimant who receives payment of a property damage claim. Generally, such subrogated claims are authorized by state law and are therefore not barred by the Antiassignment Act.</P>
                <P>(5) Before claims are paid, it is necessary to determine whether there may be a valid subrogated claim under a federal or state statute or a subrogation contract held valid by state law.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Interdepartmental waiver rule.</E> Neither the U.S. government nor any of its instrumentalities are proper claimants due to the interdepartmental waiver rule. This rule bars claims by any organization or activity of the Army, whether or not the organization or activity is funded with appropriated or nonappropriated funds. Certain federal agencies are authorized by statute to file claims, for example, Medicare and the Railroad Retirement Commission. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-17f.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">States are excluded.</E> If a state, U.S. commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia maintains a unit to which ARNG personnel causing the injury or damage are assigned, such governmental entity is not a proper claimant for loss or damage to its property. A unit of local government other than a state, commonwealth, or territory is a proper claimant.

                <P>Claims personnel will acknowledge all claims immediately upon receipt, in writing, by telephone, or in person. A defective claim will be acknowledged in writing, pointing out its defects. Where the defects render the submission jurisdictionally deficient based on the requirements discussed in DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-5 and 2-6, the claimant or attorney will be informed in writing of the need to present a proper claim no later than two years from the date of accrual. Suit must be filed in maritime claims not later than two years from the date of accrual. See § 536.122. In any claim for personal injury or wrongful death, an authorization signed by the patient, natural or legal guardian or estate representative will be obtained authorizing the use of medical information, including medical records, in order to use sources other than claims personnel to evaluate the claim as required by the Health Care Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. 1320d-1320d-8.

                <SUBJECT>Revision of filed claims.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A revision or change of a previously filed claim may constitute an amendment or a new claim. Upon receipt, the CJA must determine whether a new claim has been filed. If so, the claim must be logged with a new number and acknowledged in accordance with § 536.27.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">New claim.</E> A new claim is filed whenever the writing alleges a new theory of liability, a new tortfeasor, a new party claimant, a different date or location for the claims incident, or other basic element that constitutes an allegation of a different tort not originally alleged. If the allegation is made verbally or by e-mail, the claimant will be informed in writing that a new SF 95 must be filed. A new claim must be filed not later than two years from the accrual date under the FTCA. Filing a new claim creates an additional six month period during which suit may not be filed.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment.</E> An increase or decrease in the amount claimed constitutes an amendment, not a new claim. Similarly, the addition of required information not on the original claim constitutes an amendment. Examples are date of birth, marital status, military status, names of witnesses, claimant's address, description, or location of property or insurance information. An amendment may be filed before or after the two year SOL has run unless final action has been taken. A new number will not be assigned to an amended claim; however, a change in the amount will be annotated in the database.

                <SUBJECT>Action upon receipt of claim.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) A properly filed claim stops the running of the SOL when it is received by any organization or activity of the <PRTPAGE P="169"/>DOD or the U.S. Armed Services. Placing a claim in the mail does not constitute filing. The first Army claims office that receives the claim will date, time stamp, and initial the claim as of the date the claim was initially received “on post,” not by the claims office. If initially received close to the SOL's expiration date by an organization or activity that does not have a claims office, claims personnel will discover and record in the file the date of original receipt.</P>
                <P>(b) The ACO or CPO that first receives the claim will enter the claim into the Tort and Special Claims Application (TSCA) database and let the system assign a number to the claim. The claim, whether on an SF 95 or in any other format, shall be scanned into a computer and uploaded onto the TSCA database so that it will become a permanent part of the electronic record. A joint claim will be given a number for each claimant, for example, husband and wife, injured parent and children. If only one sum is filed for all claimants, the same sum will be assigned for each claimant. However, request the claimant to name a sum for each claimant. The claim will bear this number throughout the claims process. Upon transfer, a new number will not be assigned by the receiving office. If a claim does not meet the definition of a proper claim under §§ 536.26 and 536.27, it will be date stamped and logged as a Potentially Compensable Event (PCE).</P>
                <P>(c) The claim will be transferred if the claim incident arose in another ACO's geographic area; the receiving ACO will use the claims number originally assigned.</P>
                <P>(d) Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) claims that relate to claims determined cognizable under subpart K of this part will be marked with the symbol “NAFI” immediately following the claimant's name, to preclude erroneous payment from appropriated funds (APF). This symbol will also be included in the subject line of all correspondence.</P>
                <P>(e) Upon receipt, copies of the claims will be furnished as follows (when a current e-mail address is available and it is agreeable with the receiving party, providing copies by e-mail is acceptable):</P>
                <P>(1) To USARCS, if the amount claimed exceeds $25,000, or $50,000 per incident. However, if the claim arises under the FTCA or AMCSA, only furnish copies if the amount claimed exceeds $50,000, or $100,000 per incident.</P>
                <P>(2) For medical malpractice claims, to the appropriate MTF Commander/s through MEDCOM Headquarters, and to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at the addresses listed below.</P>
                <P>MEDCOM, ATTN: MCHO-CL-Q, 2050 Worth Road, Suite 26, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234-5026.</P>

                <P>Department of Legal Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, 1335 E. West Highway, #6-100, Silver Spring, MD 20910-6254, Commercial: 301-295-8115, e-mail: <E T="03">casha@afip.osd.mil.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(3) If the claim is against AAFES forward a copy to: HQ Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), ATTN: Office of the General Counsel (GC-Z), P.O. Box 650062, Dallas, TX 75265-0062, e-mail: <E T="03">blanchp@aafes.com.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(4) If the claim involves a NAFI, including a recreational user or family child care provider forward a copy to: Army Central Insurance Fund, ATTN: CFSC-FM-I, 4700 King Street, Alexandria, VA 22302-4406, e-mail: <E T="03">riskmanagement@cfsc.army.mil.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(f) ACOs or CPOs will furnish a copy of any medical or dental malpractice claim to the MTF or dental treatment facility commander and advise the commander of all subsequent actions. The commander will be assisted in his or her responsibility to complete DD Form 2526 (Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims).

                <P>(a) Claims filed with the wrong federal agency, or claims that should be <PRTPAGE P="170"/>adjudicated by receiving State offices under NATO or other SOFA, will be immediately transferred to the proper agency together with notice of same to the claimant or legal representative. Where multiple federal agencies are involved, other agencies will be contacted and a lead agency established to take all actions on the claim. Where the DA is the lead agency, any final action will include other agencies. Similarly, where another agency is the lead agency, that agency will be requested to include DA in any final action. Such inclusion will prevent multiple dates for filing suit or appeal.</P>

                <P>(b) If another agency has taken denial action on a claim that involves the DA, without informing the DA, and in which the DA desires to make a payment, the denial action may be reconsidered by the DA not later than six months from the date of mailing and payment made thereafter.

                <P>Small claims procedures are authorized for use whenever a claim may be settled for $5,000 or less. These procedures are designed to save processing time and eliminate the need for most of the documentation otherwise required. These procedures are described in DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-14 and 2-26.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 536.34</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Determination of correct statute.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Consideration under more than one statute.</E> When Congress enacted the various claims statutes, it intended to allow federal agencies to settle meritorious claims. A claim must be considered under other statutes in this part unless one particular statute precludes the use of other statutes, whether the claim is filed on DD Form 1842 (Claim for Loss of or Damage to Personal Property Incident to Service) or SF 95. Prior to denial of an AR 27-20, chapter 11 claim, consider whether it may fall within the scope of subparts C, D, or F of this part, and where indicated, question the claimant to determine whether the claim sounds in tort.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Exclusiveness of certain remedies.</E> Certain remedies exclude all others. For example, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over U.S. Constitution Fifth Amendment takings, express or implied-in-fact, as well as governmental contract losses, or intangible property losses. Claims of this nature for $10,000 or less may be filed in a U.S. District Court. There is no administrative remedy. While the FTCA is the preemptive tort remedy in the United States, its commonwealths, territories and possessions, nevertheless, other remedies must be exhausted prior to favorable consideration under the FTCA. The FTCA does not preclude use of the MCA or the NGCA for claims arising out of noncombat activities or brought by soldiers for incident-to-service property losses sustained within the United States. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-15a and b for a more detailed discussion of determining the correct statute for property claims versus personal injury and death claims. In addition, it is important to consider the nature of the claim, e.g., whether the claim may be medical malpractice in nature, related to postal matter, or an automobile accident. Discussions of these and many other different types of claims are also provided herein as well as in the corresponding paragraph 2-15 of DA Pam 27-162. It is also very important to consider when a claim may fall outside the jurisdiction of the Army claims system. Some of these instances are alluded to immediately above, but for a detailed discussion of related remedies see § 536.36 of this part and paragraph 2-17 of DA Pam 27-162.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Status of Forces Agreement claims.</E> (1) Claims arising out of the performance of official duties in a foreign country where the United States is the sending State must be filed and processed under a SOFA, provided that the claimant is a proper party claimant under the SOFA. DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-15c sets forth the rules applicable in particular countries. A SOFA provides an exclusive remedy subject to waiver as set forth in § 536.76(h) of this part.<PRTPAGE P="171"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Single-service jurisdiction is established for all foreign countries in which a SOFA is in effect and for certain other countries. A list of these countries is posted on the USARCS Web site; for the address see § 536.2(a). Claims will be processed by the service exercising single-service responsibility. In the United States, USARCS is the receiving State office and all SOFA claims should be forwarded immediately to USARCS for action. Appropriate investigation under subpart B of this part procedures is required of an ACO or a CPO under USARCS' direction.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Foreign Claims Act claims.</E> (1) Claims by foreign inhabitants, arising in a foreign country, which are not cognizable under a SOFA, fall exclusively under the FCA. The determination as to whether a claimant is a foreign inhabitant is governed by the rules set out in subpart C and subpart J of this part. In case of doubt, this determination must be based on information obtained from the claimant and others, particularly where the claimant is a former U.S. service member or a U.S. citizen residing in a foreign country.</P>
                <P>(2) Tort claims will be processed by the armed service that exercises single-service responsibility. When requested, the Commander USARCS may furnish a Judge Advocate or civilian attorney to serve as a Foreign Claims Commission (FCC) for another service. With the concurrence of the Commander USARCS, Army JAs may be appointed as members of another department's foreign claims commissions. See subpart J of this part. The FCA permits compensation for damages caused by “out-of-scope” tortious conduct of Soldier and civilian employees. Many of these claims are also compensable under Article 139, Uniform Code of Military Justice. See DA Pam 27-162, chap. 9. To avoid the double payment of claims, ACOs and CPOs must promptly notify the Command Claims Service of each approved Article 139 claim involving a claimant who could also file under an applicable SOFA.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">National Guard Claims Act claims.</E> (1) Claims attributed to the acts or omissions of ARNG personnel in the course of employment fall into the categories set forth in subpart F of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) An ACO will establish with a state claims office routine procedures for the disposition of claims, designed to ensure that the United States and state authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for processing claims. The procedures will require personnel to advise the claimant of any remedy against the state or its insurer.</P>
                <P>(i) Where the claim arises out of the act or omission of a member of the ARNG or a person employed under 32 U.S.C. 709, it must be determined whether the employee is acting on behalf of the state or the United States. For example, an ARNG pilot employed under section 709 may be flying on a state mission, federal mission, or both, on the same trip. This determination will control the disposition of the claim. If agreement with the concerned state cannot be reached and the claim is otherwise payable, efforts may be made to enter into a sharing agreement with the state concerned. The following procedures are required in the event there is a remedy against the state and the state refuses to pay or the state maintains insurance coverage and the claimant has filed an administrative claim against the United States. First, forward the file and the tort claim memorandum, including information on the status of any judicial or administrative action the claimant has taken against the state or its insurer to the Commander USARCS. Upon receipt, the Commander USARCS will determine whether to require the claimant to exhaust his or her remedy against the state or its insurer or whether the claim against the United States can be settled without requiring such exhaustion. If the Commander USARCS decides to follow the latter course of action, he or she will also determine whether to obtain an assignment of the claim against the state or its insurer and whether to initiate recovery action to obtain contribution or indemnification. The state or its insurer will be given appropriate notification in accordance with state law.</P>

                <P>(ii) If an administrative claim remedy exists under state law or the state maintains liability insurance, the Commander USARCS or an ACO acting <PRTPAGE P="172"/>upon the Commander USARCS' approval may enter into a sharing agreement covering payment of future claims. The purpose of such an agreement is to determine in advance whether the state or the DA is responsible for processing a claim (did the claim arise from a federal or state mission?), to expedite payment in meritorious claims, and to preclude double recovery by a claimant.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Third-party claims involving an independent contractor</E>—(1) <E T="03">Generally.</E> (i) Upon receipt, all claims will be examined to determine whether a contractor of the United States is the tortfeasor. If so, the claimant or legal representative will be notified of the name and address of the contractor and further advised that the United States is not responsible for the acts or omissions of an independent contractor. This will be done prior to any determination as to the contractor's degree of culpability as compared to that of the United States.</P>
                <P>(ii) If, upon investigation, the damage is considered to be primarily due to the contractor's fault or negligence, the claim will be referred to the contractor or the contractor's insurance carrier for settlement and the claimant will be so advised.</P>
                <P>(iii) Health care providers hired under personal services contracts under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1089 are not considered to be independent contractors but employees of the United States for tort claims purposes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Claims for injury or death of contractor employees.</E> Upon receipt of a claim for injury or death of a contractor employee, a copy of the portions of the contract applicable to claims and workers' compensation will be obtained, either through the contracting office or from the contractor. Claims personnel must find out the status of any claim for workers' compensation benefits as well as whether the United States paid the premiums. The goal is to involve the contractor in any settlement, where indicated, in the manner set forth in DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-15f and 2-61. In claims arising in foreign countries consider whether the claim is covered by the Defense Bases Act, 42 U.S.C. 1651-1654.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Claims by contractors for damage to or loss of their property during the performance of their contracts.</E> Claims by contractors for property damage or loss should be referred to the contracting officer for determination as to whether the claim is payable under the contract. Such a claim is not payable under the FTCA where the damage results from an in-scope act or omission. Contract appeal procedures must be exhausted prior to consideration as a bailment under the MCA or FCA.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Maritime claims.</E> Maritime torts are excluded from consideration under the FTCA. The various maritime statutes are exclusive remedies within the United States and its territorial waters. Maritime statutes include the Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (AMCSA), 10 U.S.C. 4801, 4802 and 4806, the Suits in Admiralty Act (SIAA), 46 U.S.C. app. 781-790, the Public Vessels Act (PVA), 46 U.S.C. app. 781-790, and the Admiralty Extension Act (AEA), 46 U.S.C. app. 740. Within the U.S. and its territorial waters, maritime suits may be filed under the SIAA or the PVA without first filing an administrative claim, except where administrative filing is required by the AEA. Administrative claims may also be filed under the AMSCA. In any administrative claim brought under the AMCSA, all action must be completed not later than two years from its accrual date or the SOL will expire. Outside the United States, a maritime tort may be brought under the MCA or FCA as well as the AMCSA. The body of water on which it occurs must be navigable and a maritime nexus must exist. Once a maritime claim is identified, give the claimant written notice of the two-year filing requirement. In case of doubt, the ACO or CPO should discuss the matter with the appropriate AAO. Even when the claimant does not believe that a maritime claim is involved, provide the claimant with precautionary notice. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-7e and 8-6.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Postal claims.</E> See also DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-15i, 2-30 and 2-56g discussing postal claims.</P>

                <P>(1) Claims by the U.S. Postal Service for funds and stock are adjudicated by USARCS with assistance from the Military Postal Service Agency and the <PRTPAGE P="173"/>ACO or CPO having jurisdiction over the particular Army post office, when directed by USARCS to assist in the investigation of the claim.</P>
                <P>(2) Claims for loss of registered and insured mail are processed under subpart C of this part by the ACO or CPO having jurisdiction over the particular Army post office.</P>
                <P>(3) Claims for loss of, or damage to, parcels delivered by United Parcel Service (UPS) are the responsibility of UPS.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Blast damage claims.</E> After completing an investigation and prior to final action, all blast damage claims resulting from Army firing and demolition activities must be forwarded to the Commander USARCS for technical review. The sole exception to this rule is when a similar claim is filed citing the same time, place and type of damage as one which has already received technical review. See also DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-28.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Motor vehicle damage claims arising from the use of non-governmental vehicles.</E> See also § 536.60 (splitting property damage and personal injury claims) and DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-15k (determining the correct statute), 2-61 (joint tort feasors), and 2-62e (indemnity or contribution).</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Government tortfeasors.</E> A Soldier or U.S. government civilian employee who negligently damages his or her personal property while acting within the scope of employment is not a proper claimant for damage to that property.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Claims by lessors for damage to rental vehicles.</E> Third-party claims arising from the use of rental vehicles will be processed in the same manner as NAFI commercially insured activities after exhaustion of any other remedy under the Government Travel Card Program or the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command Car Rental Agreement.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Third-party damages arising from the use of privately owned vehicles.</E> Third-party tort claims arising within the United States from a Soldier's use of a privately owned vehicle (POV) while allegedly within the scope of employment must be forwarded to the Commander USARCS for review and consultation before final action. The claim will be investigated and any authorization for use ascertained including payment for mileage. A copy of the Soldier's POV insurance policy will be obtained prior to forwarding. If the DA is an additional insurer under applicable state law, the claim will be forwarded to the Soldier's liability carrier for payment. When the tort claim arises in a foreign country, follow the provisions of subpart J of this part.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Claims arising from gratuitous use of DOD or Army vehicles, equipment or facilities.</E> (1) Before the commencement of any event that involves the use of DOD or Army land, vehicles, equipment or Army personnel for community activities, the Command involved should be advised to first determine and weigh the risk to potential third-party claimants against the benefits to the DOD or the Army. Where such risk is excessive, try to obtain an agreement from the sponsoring civilian organization holding the Army harmless. When feasible, third-party liability insurance may be required from the sponsor and the United States added to the policy as a third-party insured.</P>
                <P>(2) When Army equipment and personnel are used for debris removal relief pursuant to the Federal Disaster Relief Act, 42 U.S.C. 5173, the state is required to assume responsibility for third-party claims. The senior judge advocate for a task force engaged in such relief should obtain an agreement requiring the state to hold the Army harmless and establish a procedure for payment by the state. Claims will be received, entered into the TSCA database, investigated and forwarded to state authorities for action.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Real estate claims.</E> Claims for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession or disposition of real property or interests therein, are generally payable under AR 405-15. These claims are handled by the Real Estate Claims Office in the appropriate COE District or a special office created for a deployment. Directorate of Real Estate, Office of the Chief of Engineers, has supervisory authority. Claims for damage to real property and incidental personal property, but not for rent (for example, claims arising during a maneuver or <PRTPAGE P="174"/>deployment) may be payable under subparts C or J of this part. However, priority should be given to the use of AR 405-15 as it is more flexible and expeditious. In contingency operations and deployments, there is a large potential for overlap between contractual property damage claims and noncombat activity/maneuver claims. Investigate carefully to ensure the claim is in the proper channel (claims or real estate), that it is fairly settled, and that the claimant does not receive a double payment. For additional guidance, see subpart J of this part and United States Army Claims Service Europe (USACSEUR) Real Estate/Office of the Judge Advocate Standard Operating Procedures for Processing Claims Involving Real Estate During Contingency Operations (August 20, 2002).</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Claims generated by civil works projects.</E> Civil works projects claims arising from tortious activities are defined by whether the negligent or wrongful act or omission arising from a project or activity is funded by a civil works appropriation. Civil works claims are those noncontractual claims which arise from a negligent or wrongful act or omission during the performance of a project or activity funded by civil works appropriations as distinguished from a project or activity funded by Army operation and maintenance funds. Civil works claims are paid out of civil works appropriations to the extent set forth in § 536.71(f). A civil works claim can also arise out of a noncombat activity, for example, an inverse condemnation claim in which flooding exceeds the high water mark. Maritime claims under subpart H of this part are civil works claims when they arise out of the operation of a dam, locks or navigational aid.

                <P>Claims for property damage, personal injury, or death arising in the United States based on contamination by toxic substances found in the air or the ground must be reported by USARCS to the Environmental Law Division of the Army Litigation Center and the Environmental Torts Branch of DOJ. Such claims arising overseas must be reported to the Command Claims Service with geographical jurisdiction over the claim and USARCS. Claims for personal injury from contamination frequently arise at an area that is the subject of claims for cleanup of the contamination site. The cleanup claims involve other Army agencies, use of separate funds, and prolonged investigation. Administrative settlement is not usually feasible because settlement of property damage claims must cover all damages, including personal injury. Payment by Defense Environmental Rehabilitation Funds should be considered initially and any such payment should be deducted from any settlement under AR 27-20.</P>

Claims personnel must gather and record adverse as well as favorable information. The CJA, claims attorney or unit claims officer must preserve their legal and factual findings.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Elements of the investigation.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The investigation is conducted to ascertain the facts of an incident. Which facts are relevant often depends on the law and regulations applicable to the conduct of the parties involved but generally the investigation should develop definitive answers to such <PRTPAGE P="175"/>questions as “When?” “Where?” “Who?” “What?” and “How?”. Typically, the time, place, persons, and circumstances involved in an incident may be established by a simple report, but its cause and the resulting damage may require extensive effort to obtain all the pertinent facts.</P>
                <P>(b) The object of the investigation is to gather, with the least possible delay, the best available evidence without accumulating excessive evidence concerning any particular fact. The claimant is often an excellent source of such information and should be contacted early in the investigation, particularly when there is a question as to whether the claim was timely filed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use of experts, consultants and appraisers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) ACOs or CPOs will budget operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) funds for the costs of hiring property appraisers, accident reconstructionists, expert consultants to furnish opinions, and medical specialists to conduct independent medical examinations (IMEs). Other expenses to be provided for from O&amp;M funds include the purchase of documents, such as medical records, and the hiring of mediators. See § 536.53(b). Where the cost exceeds $750 or local funds are exhausted, a request for funding should be directed to the Commander USARCS, with appropriate justification. The USARCS AAO must be notified as soon as possible when an accident reconstruction is indicated.</P>
                <P>(b) Where the claim arises from treatment at an Army MTF, the MEDDAC commander should be requested to fund the cost of an independent consultant's opinion or an IME.</P>
                <P>(c) The use of outside consultants and appraisers should be limited to claims in which liability or damages cannot be determined otherwise and in which the use of such sources is economically feasible, for instance, where property damage is high in amount and not determinable by a government appraiser or where the extent of personal injury is serious and a government IME is neither available nor acceptable to a claimant. Prior to such an examination at an MTF, ensure that the necessary specialists are available and a prompt written report may be obtained.</P>

                <P>(d) Either an IME or an expert opinion is procured by means of a personal services contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 37, 48 CFR 37.000 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> through the local contracting office. The contract must be in effect prior to commencement of the records review. Payment is authorized only upon receipt of a written report responsive to the questions asked by the CJA or claims attorney.</P>
                <P>(e) Whenever a source other than claims personnel is used to assist in the evaluation of a claim in which medical information protected by HIPAA is involved, the source must sign an agreement designed to protect the patient's privacy rights.</P>

                <P>(a) The methods and techniques for investigating specific categories of claims are set forth in DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-25 through 2-34. The investigation of medical malpractice claims should be conducted by a CJA or claims attorney, using a medical claims investigator.</P>
                <P>(b) A properly filed claim must contain enough information to permit investigation. For example, if the claim does not specify the date, location or details of every incident complained of, the claimant or legal representative should be required to furnish the information.</P>
                <P>(c) Request the claimant or legal representative to specify a theory of liability. However, the investigation should not be limited to the theories specified, particularly where the claimant is unrepresented. All logical theories should be investigated.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determination of liability—generally.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Under the FTCA, the United States is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission giving rise to the tort occurred (28 U.S.C. 2673 and 2674). This means that liability must rest on the existence of a tort cognizable under state law, hereinafter referred to as a state tort. A finding of <PRTPAGE P="176"/>state tort liability requires the litigating attorney to prove the elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages as interpreted by federal case law.</P>
                <P>(b) The foregoing principles and requirements will be followed in regard to tort claims against the United States under other subparts, with certain exceptions noted within the individual subparts or particular tort statutes.</P>
                <P>(c) Interpretation will be made in accordance with FTCA case law and also maritime case law where applicable. Additionally, a noncombat activity can furnish the basis for a claim under subparts C, F, and J of this part. Noncombat activities include claims arising out of civil works, such as inverse condemnation.</P>
                <P>(d) Federal, not state or local, law applies to a determination as to who is a federal employee or a member of the armed forces. Under all subparts, the designation “federal employee” excludes a contractor of the United States. See 28 U.S.C. 2671. See however, § 536.23(b)(4)(ii) concerning personal services contractors. For employment identification purposes apply FTCA case law in making a determination.</P>
                <P>(e) Federal, not state or local, law applies to an interpretation of the SOL under all subparts. Minority or incompetence does not toll the SOL. Case law developed under the FTCA will be used in other subparts in interpreting SOL questions.</P>
                <P>(f) Under the FTCA state or local law is used to determine scope of employment and under other subparts for guidance.</P>

                <P>A claim for violation of the U.S. Constitution does not constitute a state tort and is not cognizable under any subpart. A constitutional claim will be scrutinized in order to determine whether it is totally or partially payable as a state tort. For example, a Fifth Amendment taking may be payable in an altered form as a real estate claim. For further discussion see DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-36.</P>

Derivative claims and claims for indemnity are also excluded.</P>

                <P>(b) Claims for personal injury or wrongful death by members of a foreign military force participating in a joint military exercise or operation arising incident to service are not payable under any subpart. Claims for property loss or damage, but not subrogated claims, may be payable under subpart C of this part. Derivative claims and claims for indemnity or contribution are not payable under any subpart.

This exclusion also does not apply to a health care provider as defined in 10 U.S.C. 1089 and § 536.80 of this part, under the conditions listed therein.</P>
                <P>(i) Arises from the fiscal operations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury or from the regulation of the monetary system.</P>

                <P>(1) A claimant or claimant's legal representative will be furnished the opportunity to substantiate the claim by providing essential documentary evidence according to the claim's nature including, but not instead of, the following: Medical records and reports, witness statements, itemized bills and paid receipts, estimates, federal tax returns, W-2 forms or similar proof of loss of earnings, photographs, and reports of appraisals or investigation. If necessary, request permission, through the legal representative, to interview the claimant, the claimant's family, proposed witnesses and treating health care providers (HCPs). In a professional negligence claim, the claimant will submit an expert opinion when requested. State law concerning the requirement for an affidavit of merit should be cited.</P>

                <P>(2) When the claimant or the legal representative fails to respond in a timely manner to informal demands for documentary evidence, interviews, or an independent medical examination (IME), make a written request. Such written request provides notice to the claimant that failure to provide substantiating evidence will result in an evaluation of the claim based only on information currently in the file. When, despite the government's request, there is insufficient information in the file to permit evaluation, the claim will be denied for failure to document it. Failure to submit to an IME or sign an authorization to use medical information protected by HIPAA, for <PRTPAGE P="180"/>review or evaluation by a source other than claims personnel, are both grounds for denial for failure to document, provided such evaluation is essential to the determination of liability or damages. State a time limit, for example, 30 or 60 days, to furnish the substantiation or expert opinion required in a medical malpractice claim.</P>
                <P>(3) If, in exchange for complying with the government's request for the foregoing information, the claimant or the legal representative requests similar information from the file, the claimant may be provided such information and documentation as is releasable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). Additionally, work product may be released if such release will help settle the claim. See § 536.18.</P>

                <P>(b) An evaluation should be viewed from the claimant's perspective. In other words, before denying a claim, first determine whether there is any reasonable basis for compromise. Certain jurisdictional issues and statutory bases may not be open for compromise. The incident to service and FECA exclusions are rarely subject to compromise, whereas the SOL is more subject to compromise. Factual and legal disputes are compromisable, frequently providing a basis for limiting damages, not necessarily grounds for denial. Where a precise issue of dispute is identified and is otherwise unresolvable, mediation by a disinterested qualified person, such as a federal judge, or foreign equivalent for claims arising under the FCA, should be obtained upon agreement with the claimant or the claimant's legal representative. Contributory negligence has given way to comparative negligence in most United States jurisdictions. In most foreign countries, comparative negligence is the rule of law.

                <P>When joint tortfeasors are liable, it is DA policy to pay only the fair share of a claim attributable to the fault of the United States rather than pay the claim in full and then bring suit against the joint tortfeasor for contribution. If payment from a joint tortfeasor is not forthcoming after the CJA's demand, the United States should settle for its fair share, provided the claimant is willing to hold the United States harmless. Where a joint tortfeasor's liability greatly outweighs that of the United States, the claim should be referred to the joint tortfeasor for action.</P>

                <P>(a) The use of future periodic payments, including reversionary medical trusts, is encouraged to ensure that the injured party is adequately compensated and able to meet future needs.</P>
                <P>(1) It is necessary to ensure adequate care and compensation for a minor or other incompetent claimant or unemployed survivor over a period of years.</P>
                <P>(2) A medical trust is necessary to ensure the long-term availability of funds for anticipated future medical care, the cost of which is difficult to predict.</P>
                <P>(3) The injured party's life expectancy cannot be reasonably determined or is likely to be shortened.</P>
                <P>(b) Under subpart D of this part, structured settlements cannot be required but are encouraged in situations listed above or where state law permits them. In the case of a minor, every effort should be made to insure that the minor, and not the parents, receives the benefit of the settlement. Annuity payments at the age of majority should be considered. If rejected, a blocked bank account may be used.</P>

                <P>(c) It is the policy of the Department of Justice never to discuss the tax-free nature of a structured settlement.

                <SUBJECT>Negotiations—purpose and extent.</SUBJECT>

                <P>It is DA policy to settle meritorious claims promptly and fairly through direct negotiation at the lowest possible level. The Army's negotiator should not admit liability as such is not necessary. However, the settlement should reflect diminished value where contributory negligence or other value-diminishing factors exist. The negotiator should be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the case, including the claimant's background, the key witnesses, the anticipated testimony and <PRTPAGE P="181"/>the appearance of the scene. There is no substitute for the claims negotiator's personal study of, and participation in, the case before settlement negotiations begin. If settlement is not possible due to the divergence in the offers, refine the issues as much as possible in order to expedite any subsequent suit. Mediation should be used if the divergence is due to an issue of law affecting either liability or damages. For further discussion see DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-64.</P>

                <P>An AAO or, when delegated additional authority, an ACO or a CPO, has authority to settle claims in an amount exceeding the monetary authority delegated by regulation. It is DA policy to delegate USARCS authority, on a case-by-case basis, to an ACO or a CPO possessing the appropriate ability and experience. Only an attorney should negotiate with a claimant's attorney. Negotiations with unrepresented claimants may be conducted by a non-attorney, under the supervision of an attorney.

                <P>All aspects of the applicable law and procedure, except the amount to be claimed, should be explained to both potential and actual claimants. The negotiator will ensure that the claimant is aware of whether the negotiator is an attorney or a non-attorney, and that the negotiator represents the United States. As to claims within USARCS' monetary authority, the chronology and details of negotiations should be memorialized with a written record furnished to the claimant. The claimant should understand that it is not necessary to hire an attorney, but when an attorney is needed, the negotiator should recommend hiring one. In a claim where liability is not an issue, the claimant should be informed that if an attorney is retained, the claimant should attempt to negotiate an hourly fee for determination of damages only.

                <SUBJECT>Settlement or approval authority.</SUBJECT>
                <P>“Settlement authority” is a statutory term (10 U.S.C. 2735) meaning that officer authorized to approve, deny or compromise a claim, or make final action. “Approval authority” means the officer empowered to settle, pay or compromise a claim in full or in part, provided the claimant agrees. “Final action authority” means the officer empowered to deny or make a final offer on a claim. Determining the proper officer empowered to approve or make final action on a claim depends on the claims statute involved and any limitations that apply under that statute. DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-69, outlines how various authority is delegated among offices.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Splitting property damage and personal injury claims.</SUBJECT>

                <P>Normally, a claim will include all damages that accrue by reason of the incident. Where a claimant has a claim for property damage and personal injury arising from the same incident, the property damage claim may be paid, under certain circumstances, prior to the filing of the personal injury claim. The personal injury claim may be filed later provided it is filed within the applicable statute of limitations. When both property damage and personal injury arise from the same incident, the property damage claim may be paid to either the claimant or, under subparts D or H of this part, the insurer and the same claimant may receive a subsequent payment for personal injury. Only under subparts D or H of this part may the insurer receive subsequent payment for subrogated medical bills and lost earnings when the personal injury claim is settled. The primary purpose of settling an injured claimant's property damage claim before settling the personal injury claim is to pay the claimant for vehicle damage expeditiously and avoid costs associated with delay such as loss of use, loss of business, or storage charges. The Commander USARCS' approval must be obtained whenever the estimated value of any one claim exceeds $25,000, or the value of all claims, actual or potential, arising from the incident exceeds $50,000; however, if the <PRTPAGE P="182"/>claim arises under the FTCA or AMCSA, only if the amount claimed exceeds $50,000, or $100,000 per incident.</P>

                <P>(a) This section implements 10 U.S.C. 2736 (Act of September 8, 1961 (75 Stat. 488)) as amended by Public Law 90-521 (82 Stat. 874); Public Law 98-564 (90 Stat. 2919); and Public Law 100-465 (102 Stat. 2005)). No new liability is created by 10 U.S.C. 2736, which merely permits partial advance payments, only under subparts C, F or J of this part, on claims not yet filed. See AR 27-20, paragraph 11-18 for information on emergency partial payments in personnel claims, which are not governed by 10 U.S.C. 2736.</P>
                <P>(b) The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) and the Assistant Judge Advocate General (TAJAG) may make advance payments in amounts not exceeding $100,000; the Commander USARCS, in amounts not exceeding $25,000, and the authorities designated in §§ 536.786(4) and (5) and 536.101, in amounts not exceeding $10,000, subject to advance coordination with USARCS, if the estimated total value of the claim exceeds their monetary authority. Requests for advance payments in excess of $10,000 will be forwarded to USARCS for processing.</P>
                <P>(c) Under subpart J of this part, three-member foreign claims commissions may make advance payments under the FCA in amounts not exceeding $10,000, subject to advance coordination with USARCS if the estimated total value of the claim exceeds their monetary authority.</P>
                <P>(d) An advance payment, not exceeding $100,000, is authorized in the limited category of claims or potential claims considered meritorious under subparts C, F or J of this part, that result in immediate hardship. An advance payment is authorized only under the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) The claim, or potential claim, must be determined to be cognizable and meritorious under the provisions of subparts C, F or J of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) An immediate need for food, clothing, shelter, medical or burial expenses, or other necessities exists.</P>
                <P>(3) The payee, so far as can be determined, would be a proper claimant, including an incapacitated claimant's spouse or next-of-kin.</P>
                <P>(4) The total damage sustained must exceed the amount of the advance payment.</P>
                <P>(5) A properly executed advance payment acceptance agreement has been obtained. This acceptance agreement must state that it does not constitute an admission of liability by the United States and that the amount paid shall be deducted from any subsequent award.</P>

                <P>(e) There is no statutory authority for making advance payments for claims payable under subparts D or H of this part.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">When required.</E> (1) All claims will be acted on prior to being closed except for those that are transferred. For claims on which suit is filed before final action, see § 536.66. A settlement authority may deny or pay in full or in part any claim in a stated amount within his or her delegated authority. An approval authority may pay in full or in part, but may not deny, a claim in a stated amount within his or her delegated authority. If any one claim arising out of the same incident exceeds a settlement or approval authority's monetary jurisdiction, all claims from that incident will be forwarded to the authority having jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(2) In any claim which must be supported by an expert opinion as to duty, negligence, causation or damages, an expert opinion must be submitted upon request. All opinions must meet the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Evidence 702.</P>
                <P>(3) An action memorandum is required for all final actions regardless of whether payment is made electronically. The memorandum will contain a sufficient rendition of the facts, law or damages to justify the action being taken.

                <SUBJECT>Settlement agreements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">When required.</E> (1) A claimant's acceptance of an award constitutes full and final settlement and release of any and all claims against the United States and its employees, except as to payments made under §§ 536.60 and 536.61. A settlement agreement is required prior to payment on all tort claims, whether the claim is paid in full or in part.</P>
                <P>(2) DA Form 1666 (Claims Settlement Agreement) may be used for payment of COE claims of $2,500 or less or all Army Central Insurance Fund and Army and Air Force Exchange Service claims.</P>
                <P>(3) DA Form 7500 (Tort Claim Payment Report) will be used for all payments from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), for example, FTCA claims of $2,500 or less, FCA and MCA claims of $100,000 or less and all maritime claims regardless of amount.</P>
                <P>(4) Financial Management Service (FMS) Forms 194, 196 and 197 will be used for all payments from the Judgment Fund, for example, FTCA claims exceeding $2,500, MCA and FCA claims exceeding $100,000.</P>
                <P>(5) An alternative settlement agreement will be used when the claimant is represented by an attorney, or when any of the above settlement agreement forms are legally insufficient (such as when multiple interests are present, a hold harmless agreement is reached, or there is a structured settlement). For further discussion, see DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-73c.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Unconditional settlement.</E> The settlement agreement must be unconditional. The settlement agreement represents a meeting of the minds. Any changes to the agreement must be agreed upon by all parties. The return of a proffered settlement agreement with changes written thereon or on an accompanying document represents, in effect, a counteroffer and must be resolved. Even if the claimant signs the agreement and objects to its terms, either in writing or verbally, the settlement is defective and the objection must be resolved. Otherwise a final offer should be made.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Court approval</E>—(1) <E T="03">When required.</E> Court approval is required in a wrongful death claim, or where the claimant is a minor or incompetent. The claimant is responsible to obtain court approval in a jurisdiction that is locus of the act or omission giving rise to the claim or in which the claimant resides. The court must be a state or local court, including a probate court. If the claimant can show that court approval is not required under the law of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred or where the claimant resides, the citation of the statute will be provided and accompany the payment documents.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Attorney representation.</E> If the claimant is a minor or incompetent, the claimant must be represented by a lawyer. If not already represented, the claimant should be informed that the requirement is mandatory unless state or local law expressly authorizes the parents or a person in loco parentis to settle the claim.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Costs.</E> The cost of obtaining court approval will be factored into the amount of the settlement; however, the amount of the costs and other costs will not be written into the settlement, only the 20% limitation on attorney fees will be included.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Claims involving an estate or personal representative of an estate.</E> On claims presented on behalf of a decedent's estate, the law of the state having jurisdiction should be reviewed to determine who may bring a claim on <PRTPAGE P="184"/>behalf of the estate, if court appointment of an estate representative is required, and if court approval of the settlement is required.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Signature requirements.</E> (1) Except as noted in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(6) of this section, all settlement agreements will be signed individually by each claimant. A limited power of attorney signed by the claimant specifically stating the amount being accepted and authorizing an attorney at law or in fact to sign is acceptable when the claimant is unavailable to sign. The signatures of the administrator or executor of the estate, appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction or authorized by local law, are required. The signatures of all adult beneficiaries, acknowledging the settlement, should be obtained unless permission is given by Commander USARCS. Court approval must be obtained where required by state law. If not required by state law, the citation of the state statute will accompany the payment document. Additionally, all adult heirs will sign as acknowledging the settlement. In lieu thereof, where the adult heirs are not available, the estate representative will acknowledge that all heirs have been informed of the settlement.</P>
                <P>(2) Generally, only a court-appointed guardian of a minor's estate, or a person performing a similar function under court supervision, may execute a binding settlement agreement on a minor's claim. In the United States, the law of the state where the minor resides or is domiciled will determine the age of majority and the nature and type of court approval that is needed, if any. The age of majority is determined by the age at the time of settlement, not the date of filing.</P>
                <P>(3) For claims arising in foreign countries where the amount agreed upon does not exceed $2,500, the requirement to obtain a guardian may be eliminated. For settlements over $2,500, whether or not the claim arose in the United States, refer to applicable local law, including the law of the foreign country where the minor resides.</P>
                <P>(4) In claims where the claimant is an incompetent, and for whom a guardian has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the signature of the guardian must be obtained. In cases in which competence of the claimant appears doubtful, a written statement by the plaintiff's attorney and a member of the immediate family should be obtained.</P>
                <P>(5) Settlement agreements involving subrogated claims must be executed by a person authorized by the corporation or company to act in its behalf and accompanied by a document signed by a person authorized by the corporation or company to delegate execution authority.</P>
                <P>(6) If it is believed that the foregoing requirements are materially impeding settlement of the claim, bring the matter to the attention of the Commander USARCS for appropriate resolution.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Attorneys' fees and costs.</E> (1) Attorneys' fees for all subparts in this part 536 fall under the American Rule and are payable only out of the up front cash in any settlement. Attorneys' fees will be stated separately in the settlement agreement as a sum not to exceed 20% of the award.</P>
                <P>(2) Costs are a matter to be determined solely between the attorney and the claimant and will not be set forth or otherwise enumerated in the settlement agreement.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Claims involving workers' compensation carriers.</E> The settlement of a claim involving a claimant who has elected to receive workers' compensation benefits under local law may require the consent of the workers' compensation insurance carrier, and in certain jurisdictions, the state agency that has authority over workers' compensation awards. Accordingly, claims approval and settlement authorities should be aware of local requirements.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Claims involving multiple interests.</E> Where two or more parties have an interest in the claim, obtain signatures on the settlement agreement from all parties. Examples are where both the subrogee and subrogor file a single claim for property damage, where both landlord and tenant file a claim for damage to real property, or when a POV is leased, both the lessor or lessee.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Claims involving structured settlements.</E> All settlement agreements involving structured settlements will be prepared by the Tort Claims Division, <PRTPAGE P="185"/>USARCS, and approved by the Chief or Deputy Chief, Tort Claims Division.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Final offers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When claims personnel believe that a claim should be compromised, and after every reasonable effort has been made to settle at less than the amount claimed, a settlement authority will make a written final offer within his or her monetary jurisdiction or forward the claim to the authority having sufficient monetary jurisdiction, recommending a final offer under the applicable statute. The final offer notice will contain sufficient detail to outline each element of damages as well as discuss contributory negligence, the SOL or other reasons justifying a compromise offer. The offer letter should include language indicating that if the offer is not accepted within a named time period, for example, 30 or 60 days the offer is withdrawn and the claim is denied.</P>
                <P>(b) A final offer under subpart D of this part will notify the claimant of the right to sue, not later than six months from the notice's date of mailing, and of the right to request reconsideration. The procedures for processing a request for reconsideration are set forth in § 536.89.</P>
                <P>(c) Under subparts C or F of this part, the notice will contain an appeal paragraph. A similar procedure will be followed in subparts E and H of this part. Subpart J of this part sets forth its own procedures for FCA final offers. The procedures for processing an appeal are set forth in § 536.79 of this part. The letter must inform claimants of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) They must accept the offer within 60 days or appeal. The appeal should state a counteroffer.</P>
                <P>(2) The identity of the official who will act on the appeal, and the requirement that the appeal will be addressed to the settlement authority who last acted on the claim.</P>
                <P>(3) No form is prescribed for the appeal, but the notice of appeal must fully set forth the grounds for appeal or state that it is based on the record as it exists at the time of denial or final offer.</P>
                <P>(4) The appeal must be postmarked not later than 60 days after the date of mailing of the final notice of action. If the last day of the appeal period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, as specified in Rule 6a of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following day will be considered the final day of the appeal period.</P>
                <P>(d) Where a claim for the same injury falls under both subparts C and D of this part (the MCA and the FTCA), and the denial or final offer applies equally to each such claim, the letter of notification must advise the claimant that any suit brought on any portion of the claim filed under the FTCA must be brought not later than six months from the date of mailing of the notice of final offer and any appeal under subpart C of this part must be made as stated in paragraph (c) of this section. Further, the claimant must be advised that if suit is brought, action on any appeal under subpart C of this part will be held in abeyance pending final determination of such suit.</P>

                <P>(e) Upon request, the settlement authority may extend the six-month reconsideration or 60-day appeal period provided good cause is shown. The claimant will be notified as to whether the request is granted under the FTCA and that the request precludes the filing of suit under the FTCA for 6 months. Only one reconsideration is authorized. Accordingly, that claimant should be informed of the need to make all submissions timely.

                <SUBJECT>Denial notice.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Where there is no reasonable basis for compromise, a settlement authority will deny a claim within his or her monetary jurisdiction or forward the claim recommending denial to the settlement authority that has jurisdiction. The denial notice will contain instructions on the right to sue or request reconsideration. The notice will state the basis for denial. No admission of liability will be made. A notice to an unrepresented claimant should detail the basis for denial in lay language sufficient to permit an informed decision as to whether to request appeal or reconsideration. In the interest of deterring reconsideration, appeal or suit, a denial notice may be releasable under <PRTPAGE P="186"/>the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or by the work product documents doctrine.</P>

                <P>(b) Regardless of the claim's nature or the statute under which it may be considered, letters denying claims on jurisdictional grounds that are valid, certain, and not easily overcome (and for this reason no detailed investigation as to the merits of the claim was conducted), must state that denial on such grounds is not to be construed as an opinion on the merits of the claim or an admission of liability. In medical malpractice claims, the denial should state that the file is being referred to U.S. Army Medical Command for review. If sufficient factual information exists to make a tentative ruling on the merits of the claim, liability may be expressly denied.

                <P>Thirty or sixty day letters seeking information from claimants, final offers and denial notices are time-sensitive as they require a claimant to take additional action within certain time limits. Accordingly, follow procedures to ensure that the date of mailing and receipt of a request for reconsideration are documented.

                <P>(a) An unrepresented claimant will be listed as the sole payee. Joint claimants will not be listed since settlement <PRTPAGE P="187"/>agreements must specify the amount payable to each claimant individually and each must be issued a separate check.</P>
                <P>(b) When a claimant is represented by an attorney, only one payment voucher will be issued with the claimant and the attorney as joint payees. The payment will be sent to the office of the claimant's attorney. The attorney of record, either an individual or firm designated by the claimant, will be the co-payee. If claimant has been represented by other attorneys in the same claim, such attorneys will not be listed as payees, even if they have a lien. Satisfaction of any such fee will be a matter between the claimant and such attorney. If payment is made by electronic transfer, the funds will be paid into the account of the claimant. However, if requested, the payment may be made into the attorney's escrow account provided the claimant has provided written authorization.</P>
                <P>(c) In a structured settlement the structured settlement broker will be the sole payee, who is authorized to issue checks for the amounts set forth in the settlement agreement.

                <P>(e) If the claimant is representing a deceased's estate on a wrongful death claim, or a survival action on behalf of the deceased, the payment will be made to the court-appointed representative of the estate. No payment will be made directly to the estate.

                <SUBJECT>Fund sources.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) 31 U.S.C. 1304 sets forth the type and limits of claims payable out of the Judgment Fund. Only final payments that are not payable out of agency funds are allowable, per the Treasury Financial Manual, Volume I, Part 6, Chapter 3110, at Section 3115, September 2000. Threshold amounts for payment from the judgment fund vary according to the subpart and statutes under which a claim is processed. To determine the threshold amount for any given payment procedure one must arrive at a sum of all awards for all claims arising out of that incident, including derivative claims. A joint amount is not acceptable. A claim for injury to a spouse or a child is a separate claim from one for loss of consortium or services by a spouse or parent. The monetary limits of $2,500 set forth in subpart D and $100,000 set forth in subparts C, F or J of this part, apply to each separate claim.</P>
                <P>(b) A claim for $2,500 or less arising under subpart D or E, or under §§ 536.107 through 536.113 of subpart G, is paid from the open claims allotment (see AR 27-20 paragraph 13-6 b(1)) or, if arising from a project funded by a civil works appropriation, from COE civil works funds. The Department of the Treasury pays any settlement exceeding $2,500 in its entirety, from the Judgment Fund. However, if a subpart G of this part, §§ 536.107 through 536.113 claim is treated as a noncombat activity claim, payment is made as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) The first $100,000 for each claimant on a claim settled under subparts C, F or J of this part is paid from the open claims allotment. Any amount over $100,000 is paid out of the Judgment Fund.</P>
                <P>(d) If not over $500,000, a claim arising under subpart H of this part is paid from the open claims allotment or civil works project funds as appropriate. A claim exceeding $500,000 is paid entirely by a deficiency appropriation.</P>
                <P>(e) AAFES or NAFI claims are paid from nonappropriated funds, except when such claims are subject to apportionment between appropriated and nonappropriated funds. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-80h.</P>

                <P>(f) COE claims arising out of projects not funded out of civil works project funds are payable from the open claims allotment not to exceed $2,500 for subpart D claims and $100,000 for claims arising from subparts C, F or J of this part and from the Judgment Fund, over such amounts.

                <P>(b) A tort claim arising in the United States, its commonwealths, territories, and possessions may be settled under this subpart if the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) does not apply to the type of claim under consideration or if the claim arose incident to noncombat activities. For example, a claim by a service member for property loss or damage incident to service may be settled if the loss arises from a tort and is not payable under AR 27-20, Chapter 11.</P>
                <P>(c) A tort claim arising outside the United States may be settled under this subpart only if the claimant has been determined to be an inhabitant (normally a resident) of the United States at the time of the incident giving rise to the claim. See § 536.136(b).</P>

                <P>(f) Claims not in the best interests of the United States, contrary to public policy, or otherwise contrary to the basic intent of the governing statute (10 U.S.C. 2733); for example, claims for property damage or loss or personal injury or death of inhabitants of unfriendly foreign countries or individuals considered to be unfriendly to the United States. When a claim is considered not payable for the reasons stated in this section, it will be forwarded for appropriate action to the Commander USARCS, with the recommendations of the responsible claims office.</P>
                <P>(g) Claims presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict with the United States, or any country allied with such enemy country unless the appropriate settlement authority determines that the claimant is, and at the time of the incident was, friendly to the United States. A prisoner of war or an interned enemy alien is not excluded from bringing an otherwise payable claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property in the custody of the government.</P>
                <P>(h) A claim for damages or injury, which a receiving State should adjudicate and pay under an international agreement, unless a consistent and widespread alternative process of adjudicating and paying such claims has been established within the receiving State.

                <P>(i) Claims listed in §§ 536.42, 536.43, 536.44, 536.45, and 536.46 of this part, except for the exclusion listed in § 536.45(k). Additionally, the exclusions in § 536.45(a), (b), (e) and (k) do not apply to a claim arising incident to noncombat activities.</P>

                <P>(l) Claims involving DA vehicles covered by insurance in accordance with requirements of a foreign country unless coverage is exceeded or the insurer is bankrupt. When an award is otherwise payable and an insurance settlement is not reasonably available, a field claims office should request permission from the Commander USARCS to pay the award, provided that an assignment of benefits is obtained.</P>

                <P>(ii) Claims are cognizable when based on those acts or omissions recognized as tortious by a majority of jurisdictions that require proof of duty, negligence, and proximate cause resulting in compensable injury or loss subject to the exclusions set forth at § 536.76.

                <P>(vii) Claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress may only be entertained when the claimant suffered physical injury arising from the same incident as the claim for emotional distress, or the claimant is the immediate family member of an injured party/decedent, was in the zone of danger and manifests physical injury for the emotional distress. Claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress will be evaluated under general principles of American law as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and will be considered as an element of damages under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Claims for either negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress are excluded when they arise out of assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, or slander, as defined in § 536.45(h).</P>
                <P>(viii) In a claim for personal injury or wrongful death, the total award for non-economic damages to any direct victim and all persons, including those derivative to the claim, who claim injury by or through that victim will not exceed $500,000. However, separate claims for emotional distress considered under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not subject to the $500,000 cap for the wrongful death claim as they are not included in the wrongful death claim; rather, each is a separate claim with its own $500,000 cap under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same or similar harmful activity or conditions is treated as one incident for the purposes of determining the extent of liability. If the claim accrued prior to September 1, 1995, these limitations do not apply. Any such limitation in the law of the place of occurrence will apply.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Personal injury claims</E>—(1) <E T="03">Eligible claimants.</E> Only the following may claim:</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Wrongful death claims.</E> The law of the place of the incident giving rise to the claim will apply to claims arising in the United States, its commonwealths, territories or possessions.</P>

It shall be presented by the decedent's personal representative on behalf of all parties in interest. The personal representative must be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction prior to any settlement and must agree to make distribution to the parties in interest under court jurisdiction, if required.</P>
                <P>(ii) Parties in interest are the surviving spouse, children, or dependent parents to the exclusion of all other parties. If there is no surviving spouse, children, or dependent parents, the next of kin will be considered a party or parties in interest. A dependent parent is one who meets the criteria set forth by the Internal Revenue Service to establish eligibility for a DOD identification card.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Economic loss.</E> Elements of economic damages are limited to the following:</P>

                <P>(2) The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) and the Assistant Judge Advocate General (TAJAG) are delegated authority to pay up to $100,000 in settlement of a claim and to disapprove a claim regardless of the amount claimed.</P>
                <P>(3) The Commander USARCS is delegated authority to pay up to $25,000 in settlement of a claim and to disapprove or make a final offer in a claim regardless of the amount claimed.</P>
                <P>(4) The Judge Advocate (JA) or Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), subject to limitations that USARCS may impose, and chiefs of a command claims service are delegated authority to pay up to $25,000 in settlement, regardless of the amount claimed, and to disapprove or make a final offer in a claim presented in an amount not exceeding $25,000.</P>
                <P>(5) A head of an area claims office (ACO) is delegated authority to pay up to $25,000 in settlement of a claim, regardless of the amount claimed, and to disapprove or make a final offer in a claim presented in an amount not exceeding $25,000. A head of a claims processing office (CPO) with approval authority is delegated authority to approve, in full or in part, claims presented for $5,000 or less, and to pay claims regardless of the amount claimed, provided an award of $5,000 or less is accepted in full satisfaction of the claim.</P>
                <P>(6) Authority to further delegate payment authority is set forth in § 536.3(g)(1) of this part. For further discussions also related to approval, settlement and payment authority see also paragraph 2-69 of DA Pam 27-162.</P>

All claims will <PRTPAGE P="193"/>be forwarded, along with a recommended disposition, to the authority who has monetary jurisdiction over the largest claim for a determination of liability. However, where each individual claim, including derivative claims, can be settled within the monetary authority initially acting on them, and none are subject to denial, all such claims may be settled even though the total amount exceeds the monetary jurisdiction of the approving or settlement authority.</P>
                <P>(2) If such authority determines that federal liability is established, he or she may return claims of lesser value to the field claims office for settlement within that office's jurisdiction.

                <SUBJECT>Action on appeal under the Military Claims Act.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The appeal will be examined by the settlement authority who last acted on the claim, or his or her successor, to determine if the appeal complies with the requirements of this regulation. The settlement authority will also examine the claim file and decide whether additional investigation is required; ensure that all allegations or evidence presented by the claimant, agent, or attorney are documented; and ensure that all pertinent evidence is included. If claimants state that they appeal, but do not submit supporting materials within the 60-day appeal period or an approved extension thereof, these appeals will be determined on the record as it existed at the time of denial or final offer. Unless action under paragraph (b) of this section is taken, the claim and complete investigative file, including any additional investigation, and a tort claims memorandum will be forwarded to the appropriate appellate authority for necessary action on the appeal.</P>
                <P>(b) If the evidence in the file, including information submitted by the claimant with the appeal and that found by any necessary additional investigation, indicates that the appeal should be granted in whole or in part, the settlement authority who last acted on the claim, or his or her successor, will attempt to settle the claim. If a settlement cannot be reached, the appeal will be forwarded in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) As to an appeal that requires action by TJAG, TAJAG, or the Secretary of the Army or designee, the Commander USARCS may take the action in paragraph (b) of this section or forward the claim together with a recommendation for action. All matters submitted by the claimant will be forwarded and considered.</P>

                <P>(d) Since an appeal under this subpart is not an adversarial proceeding, no form of hearing is authorized. A request by the claimant for access to documentary evidence in the claim file to be used in considering the appeal will be granted unless law or regulation does not permit access.<PRTPAGE P="194"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) If the appellate authority upholds a final offer or authorizes an award on appeal from a denial of a claim, the notice of the appellate authority's action will inform the claimant that he or she must accept the award within 180 days of the date of mailing of the notice of the appellate authority's action or the award will be withdrawn, the claim will be deemed denied, and the file will be closed without future recourse.</P>

In the absence of such a request, the settlement authority may on his or her initiative reconsider a claim.</P>

                <P>(2) An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct action on an MCA claim previously settled in whole or in part (even if a settlement agreement has been executed) when it appears that the original action was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidence of record at the time of the action or subsequently received. For errors in fact, the new evidence must not have been discoverable at the time of final action by either the Army or the claimant through the exercise of reasonable diligence. Corrective action may also be taken when an error contrary to the parties' mutual understanding is discovered in the original action. If the settlement or approval authority determines that their original action was incorrect, they will modify the action and, if appropriate, make a supplemental payment. The basis for a <PRTPAGE P="195"/>change in action will be stated in a memorandum included in the file. For example, a claim was settled for $15,000, but the settlement agreement was typed to read “$1,500” and the error is not discovered until the file is being prepared for payment. If appropriate, a corrected payment will be made. A settlement authority who has reason to believe that a settlement was obtained by fraud on the part of the claimant or claimant's legal representative, will reopen action on that claim and, if the belief is substantiated, correct the action. The basis for correcting an action will be stated in a memorandum and included in the file.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Settlement correction.</E> A successor approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's action on a claim that was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons that an original authority may do so.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This subpart applies in the United States, its commonwealths, territories and possessions (all hereinafter collectively referred to as United States or U.S.). It prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements under the FTCA and the implementing Attorney General's regulations for the administrative settlement of claims against the United States based on death, personal injury, or damage to, or loss of, property caused by negligent or wrongful acts or omissions by the United States or its employees acting within the scope of their employment.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of the Military Claims Act.</E> A tort claim arising in the United States, its commonwealths, territories, and possessions may be settled under subpart C of this part if the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) does not apply to the type of claim under consideration or if the claim arose incident to noncombat activities. If a claim is filed under both the FTCA and the Military Claims Act (MCA), or when both statutes apply equally, final action thereon will follow the procedures set forth in DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-74 through 2-76, discussing final offers and denial letters.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims payable under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Unless otherwise prescribed, claims for death, personal injury, or damage to, or loss of, property (real or personal) are payable under this subpart when the injury or damage is <PRTPAGE P="196"/>caused by negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of military personnel or civilian employees of the Department of the Army or Department of Defense while acting within the scope of their employment under circumstances in which the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. The FTCA is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity without which the United States may not be sued in tort. Similarly, neither the Fifth Amendment nor any other provision of the U.S. Constitution creates or permits a federal cause of action allowing recovery in tort. Immunity must be expressly waived, as the FTCA waives it.</P>
                <P>(b) To be payable, a claim must arise from the acts or omissions of an “employee of the government” under 28 U.S.C. 2671. Categories of such employees are listed in § 536.23(b) of this part.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Subject to the Attorney General's approval of payments in excess of $200,000 for a single claim, or if the total value of all claims and potential claims arising out of a single incident exceeds $200,000 (for which USARCS must write an action memorandum for submission to the Department of Justice), the following officials are delegated authority to settle (including payment in full or in part, or denial) and make final offers on claims under this subpart:</P>
                <P>(1) The Judge Advocate General (TJAG);</P>
                <P>(2) The Assistant Judge Advocate General (TAJAG); and</P>
                <P>(3) The Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">ACO heads.</E> A head of an area claims office (ACO) is delegated authority to pay up to $50,000 in settlement of a claim, regardless of the amount claimed, and to disapprove or make a final offer in a claim presented in an amount not exceeding $50,000, provided the value of all claims and potential claims arising out of a single incident does not exceed $200,000.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">CPO heads.</E> A head of a claims processing office (CPO) with approval authority is delegated authority to approve, in full or in part, claims presented for $5,000 or less, and to pay claims regardless of amount, provided an award of $5000 or less is accepted in full satisfaction of the claim.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Further guidance.</E> Authority to further delegate payment authority is set forth in § 536.3(g)(1) of this part. For further discussions related to approval, settlement and payment authority, see paragraphs 2-69 and 2-71 of DA Pam 27-162.</P>

All claims will be forwarded, along with a recommended disposition, to the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Commander USARCS determines that all claims can be settled for a total of $200,000 or less, he may return claims to the field office for settlement. If the Commander USARCS, determines that all claims cannot be settled for a total of $200,000, he must request Department of Justice authority prior to settlement of any one claim. The field claims office must not concede liability by paying any one claim of lesser value.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reconsideration of Federal Tort Claims Act claims.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Reconsideration of paid claims.</E> Under the provision of 28 U.S.C. 2672, neither an original or successor authority may reconsider a claim which has been paid except as expressly set forth below. Payment of an amount for <PRTPAGE P="197"/>property damage will bar payment for personal injury or death except for a split claim provided the provisions of § 536.60 are followed. Supplemental payments for either property or injury are barred by 10 U.S.C. 2672. Accordingly, claimants will be informed that only one claim or payment is permitted.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of right to reconsideration.</E> Notice of disapproval or final offer issued by an authority listed in § 536.88(b) will advise the claimant of a right to reconsideration to be submitted in writing not later than six months from the date of mailing the notice. Such a request will suspend the requirement to bring suit for a minimum of six month or until action is taken on the request. The claimant will be so informed. See the Attorney General's Regulations at 28 CFR 14.9(b), posted on the USARCS Web site; for the address see § 536.2(a).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Original approval or settlement authority</E>—(1) <E T="03">Reconsideration.</E> An original settlement authority may reconsider the denial of, or final offer on, a claim brought under the FTCA upon request of the claimant or the legal representative.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Settlement correction.</E> An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct action on a claim previously settled in whole or in part (even if a settlement agreement has been executed) when an error contrary to the parties' mutual understanding is discovered in the original action. For example: a claim was settled for $15,000, but the settlement agreement was typed to read “$1,500” and the error is not discovered until the file is being prepared for payment. If appropriate, a corrected payment will be made. An approval or settlement authority who has reason to believe that a settlement was obtained by fraud on the part of the claimant or claimant's legal representative will reopen action on that claim, and if the belief is substantiated, correct the action. The basis for correcting an action will be stated in a memorandum and included in the file.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">A successor approval or settlement authority</E>—(1) <E T="03">Reconsideration.</E> A successor approval or settlement authority may reconsider the denial of, or final offer on, an FTCA claim upon request of the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative only on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake (misinterpretation) of law.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Settlement correction.</E> A successor approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's action on a claim that was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons that an original authority may do so.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Requirement to forward a request for reconsideration.</E> When full relief is not granted, forward all requests for reconsideration of an ACO's denial or final offer to the Commander USARCS for action. Include all investigative material and legal analyses generated by the request.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Action prior to forwarding.</E> A request for reconsideration should disclose fully the legal and/or factual bases that the claimant has asserted as grounds for relief and provide appropriate supporting documents or evidence. Following completion of any investigation or other action deemed necessary for an informed disposition of the request, the approval or settlement authority will reconsider the claim and attempt to settle it, granting relief as warranted. When further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the entire file with a memorandum of opinion will be forwarded to the Commander USARCS. The claimant will be informed of such transfer.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Finality of action.</E> Action by the appropriate authority (either affirming the prior action or granting full or partial relief) upon a request for reconsideration constitutes final administrative disposition of a claim. No further requests for reconsideration will be allowed except on the basis of fraud. Attempted further requests for reconsideration on other grounds will not toll the six-month period set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Scope for claims under the National Guard Claims Act.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This subpart applies worldwide and prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural regulations for the settlement of claims against the United States for death, personal injury, damage to, or loss or destruction of property.</P>
                <P>(a) Soldiers of the Army National Guard (ARNG) can perform military duty in an active duty status under the authority of Title 10 of the United States Code, in a full-time National Guard duty or inactive-duty training status under the authority of Title 32 of the United States Code, or in a state active duty status under the authority of a state code.</P>
                <P>(1) When ARNG soldiers perform active duty, they are under federal command and control and are paid from federal funds. For claims purposes, those soldiers are treated as active duty soldiers. The NGCA, 32 U.S.C. 715, does not apply.</P>
                <P>(2) When ARNG soldiers perform full-time National Guard duty or inactive-duty training, they are under state command and control and are paid from federal funds. The NGCA does apply, but as explained in paragraph (c) of this section it is seldom used.</P>
                <P>(3) When ARNG soldiers perform state active duty, they are under state command and control and are paid from state funds. Federal claims statutes do not apply, but state claims statutes may apply.</P>
                <P>(b) The ARNG also employs civilians, referred to as technicians and employed under 32 U.S.C. 709. Technicians are usually, but not always, ARNG soldiers who perform the usual 15 days of annual training (a category of full-time duty) and 48 drills (inactive-duty training) per year.</P>

                <P>(c) NGCA coverage applies only to ARNG soldiers performing full-time National Guard duty or inactive-duty training and to technicians. However, since the NGCA's enactment in 1960, Congress has also extended Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) coverage to these personnel.<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) In 1968, technicians, who were state employees formerly, were made federal employees. Along with federal employee status came FTCA coverage. Technicians no longer have any state status, albeit they are hired, fired, and administered by a state official, the Adjutant General, acting as the agent of the federal government.</P>
                <P>(2) In 1981, Congress extended FTCA coverage to ARNG soldiers performing full-time National Guard duty or inactive-duty training (such as any training or other duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502-505). Unlike making technicians federal employees, this extension of coverage did not affect their underlying status as state military personnel.</P>
                <P>(d) Claims arising from the negligent acts or omissions of ARNG soldiers performing full-time National Guard duty or inactive-duty training, or of technicians, will be processed under the FTCA. Therefore, the NGCA is generally relevant only to claims arising from noncombat activities or outside the United States. Additionally, claims by members of the National Guard may be paid for property loss or damage incident to service if the claim is based on activities falling under this subpart and is not payable under AR 27-20, chapter 11.</P>

                <P>(a) Within the United States, Art. VIII, NATO SOFA applies to claims arising within the North Atlantic Treaty Area, which includes CONUS and its territories and possessions north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees north latitude). This excludes Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and parts of Hawaii. Third-party scope claims are payable under subpart D or, if the claim arises incident to noncombat activities, under subpart C of this part. Maritime claims are payable under subpart H of <PRTPAGE P="202"/>this part. The provisions of these subparts on what claims are payable apply equally here. The members of the foreign force or civilian component must be acting in pursuance of the applicable treaty's objectives.</P>
                <P>(b) Within the United States, third-party ex gratia claims are payable only by the sending State and are not payable under subpart E of this part.</P>

                <P>(a) Claims arising from a member of a foreign force or civilian component's acts or omissions that do not accord with the objectives of a treaty authorizing their presence in the United States.</P>
                <P>(b) Claims arising from the acts or omissions of a member of a foreign force or civilian component who has been excluded from SOFA coverage by agreement between the sending State and the United States.</P>

                <P>(c) Third-party scope claims arising within the United States that are not payable under subparts C, D, or H of this part are listed as barred under those subparts. As sending State forces are considered assimilated into the U.S. Armed Services for purposes of the SOFAs, their members are also barred from receiving compensation from the United States when they are injured incident to their service, <E T="03">Daberkow</E> v. <E T="03">United States</E>, 581 F.2d 785 (9th Cir. 1978).</P>

The JA or legal officer receiving such notification will in turn notify the Commander USARCS. If the member is neither assigned nor attached to any installation or activity within the United States, the Commander USARCS, will be notified.</P>

                <P>(a) This section sets forth guidance on claims arising from any act or omission of soldiers or members of the civilian component of the U.S. armed services done in the performance of official duty or arising from any other act or omission or occurrence for which the U.S. armed services are responsible under an international agreement. Claims incidents arising in countries for which the SOFA requires the receiving State to adjudicate and pay the claims in accordance with its laws and regulations are subject to partial reimbursement by the United States.</P>
                <P>(b) Claims by foreign inhabitants based on acts or omissions outside the scope of official duties are cognizable under subpart J of this part. Claims arising from nonscope acts or omissions by third parties who are not foreign inhabitants are cognizable under subpart E but not under subparts C or F of this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims procedures for claims arising overseas under international agreements.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) SOFA provisions that call for the receiving State to adjudicate claims have been held to be the exclusive remedy for claims against the United States, <E T="03">Aaskov</E> v. <E T="03">Aldridge,</E> 695 F. Supp. 595 (D.D.C. 1988); <E T="03">Dancy</E> v. <E T="03">Department of the Army</E>, 897 F. Supp. 612 (D.D.C. 1995).</P>
                <P>(b) SOFA provisions that call for the receiving State to adjudicate claims against the United States usually refer to claims by third parties brought against members of the force or civilian component. This includes claims by tourists or business travelers as well as inhabitants of foreign countries. Depending on how the receiving State interprets the particular SOFA's class of proper claimants, the receiving State may also consider claims by U.S. soldiers, civilian employees, and their family members. Chiefs of command claims services or other Army JA offices responsible for claims that arise in countries bound by SOFA or other treaty provisions requiring a receiving State to consider claims against the United States will ensure that all claims personnel know the receiving State's policy on which persons or classes of persons are proper claimants under such provisions. When a claim is filed both with the receiving State and under either the Military Claims Act (MCA) or Foreign Claims Act (FCA), the provisions of § 536.76(h) of this part and DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 3-4a apply.</P>
                <P>(c) When SOFA provisions provide for receiving state claims consideration, the time limit for filing such claims may be much shorter than the two years otherwise allowed under the FCA or MCA. For example, receiving state claims offices in Germany require that a claim be filed under the SOFA within three months of the date that the claimant is aware of the U.S. involvement. If the filing period is about to expire for claims arising in Germany, have the claimant fill out a claim form, make two copies, and date-stamp each copy as received by the a sending State claims office. Return the date-stamped original of the claim to the claimant with instructions to promptly file with the receiving State claims office. Keep one date-stamped copy as a potential claim. Forward one date-stamped copy of the claim to the U.S. Army Claims Service Europe (USACSEUR). This may toll the applicable German statute of limitations. Additionally, many receiving state claims offices do not require claimants to demand a sum certain. All claims personnel must familiarize themselves with the applicable receiving state law and procedures governing SOFA claims.</P>

                <P>(d) All foreign inhabitants who file claims against the United States that fall within the receiving State's responsibility, such as claims based on acts or omissions within the scope of U.S. Armed Forces members' or civilian employees' duties, must file the claim with the appropriate receiving State office. Those U.S. inhabitants whose claims would be otherwise cognizable under the Military Claims Act (subpart C of this part) and whom the receiving State deems proper claimants under the SOFA must also file with the receiving State.<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) A claim filed with, and considered by, a receiving State under a SOFA or other international agreement claims provision may be considered under other subparts of this part only if the receiving State denied the claim on the basis that it was not cognizable under the treaty or agreement provisions. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 3-4a(2), for conditions of waiver of the foregoing requirement. See also §§ 536.76(h) and 536.138(j) of this part. When a claimant has filed a claim with a receiving State and received payment, or the claim has been denied on the merits, such action will be the claimant's final and exclusive remedy and will bar any further claims against the United States.</P>

                <P>(a) Command claims services or other responsible JA offices within whose jurisdiction SOFA or other treaty provisions provide for a claim reimbursement system, and where DA has been assigned single-service responsibility for the foreign country seeking reimbursement (see § 536.17) are responsible for:</P>
                <P>(1) Establishing programs for verifying, certifying, and reimbursing claims payments. Such service or JA office will provide a copy of its procedures implementing the program to the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(2) Providing the Commander USARCS with budget estimates for reimbursements in addition to the reports required by AR 27-20, paragraph 13-7.</P>
                <P>(3) Providing the Commander USARCS each month in which payments are made, with statistical information on the number of individual claims reimbursed, the total amount paid by the foreign government, and the total amount reimbursed by the United States.</P>
                <P>(4) Providing the Commander USARCS with a quarterly report showing total reimbursements paid during the quarter for maneuver damage and tort claims classified according to major categories of damage determined by the Commander USARCS, and an update on major issues or activities that could affect the reimbursement system's operation or funding.</P>
                <P>(b) Command claims services or other responsible Army JA offices will ensure that all claims personnel within their areas of responsibility:</P>
                <P>(1) Receive annual training on the receiving State's claims procedures, including applicable time limitations, procedures and the responsible receiving State claims offices' locations.</P>
                <P>(2) Screen all new claims and inquiries about claims to identify those claimants who must file with the receiving State.</P>
                <P>(3) Ensure that all such claimants are informed of this requirement and the applicable time limitation.</P>
                <P>(4) Ensure that all applicable SOFA claims based on incidents occurring in circumstances that bring them within the United States' primary sending State jurisdiction are fully investigated.</P>

                <P>The Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (AMCSA) (10 U.S.C. 4801-04, 4806, as amended) authorizes the Secretary of the Army or his designee to administratively settle or compromise admiralty and maritime claims in favor of, and against, the United States.</P>

                <P>(a) The AMCSA permits the settlement of claims that would ordinarily fall under the Suits in Admiralty Act (SIAA), 46 U.S.C. app. 741-752; the Public Vessels Act (PVA), 46 U.S.C. app. 781-790; or the Admiralty Extension Act (AEA), 46 U.S.C. app. 740. Outside the United States the AMCSA may be used to settle admiralty claims in lieu of the Military Claims Act or Foreign Claims Act. Within the United States, filing under the AMCSA is not mandatory for causes of action as it is for the SIAA or PVA.</P>

                <P>(b) Similar maritime claims settlement authority is exercised by the Department of the Navy under 10 U.S.C. 7363 and 7621-23 and by the Department <PRTPAGE P="205"/>of the Air Force under 10 U.S.C. 9801-9804 and 9806.</P>

The claimant must have agreed to accept the settlement and it must be approved for payment by the Secretary of the Army or other approval authority prior to the end of such period. The presentation of a claim, or its consideration by the DA, neither waives nor extends the two-year limitation period and the <PRTPAGE P="206"/>claimant should be so informed, in writing, when the claim is acknowledged. See § 536.28.</P>
                <P>(b) For causes of action under the AEA, filing an administrative claim is mandatory. However, suit is required under the two-year time limit applicable to the SIAA and PVA, even though the AEA provides that no suit shall be filed under six months after filing a claim.</P>

                <P>For admiralty claims arising within the United States under the provisions of the Limitation of Shipowners' Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 181-188, in cases alleging injury or loss due to negligent operation of its vessel, the United States may limit its liability to the value of its vessel after the incident from which the claim arose. The act requires filing of an action in federal District Court within six months of receiving written notice of a claim. Therefore, USARCS, or the Chief Counsel, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), or his designee, must be notified within 10 working days of the receipt of any maritime claim arising in the United States or on the high seas out of the operation of an Army vessel, including pleasure craft owned by the United States. USARCS or Chief Counsel, COE will coordinate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) as to whether to file a limitation of liability action.</P>

                <P>The authority for this subpart is Article 139, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (10 U.S.C. 939, which provides redress for property willfully damaged or destroyed, or wrongfully taken, by members of the Armed Forces of the United States.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Proper claimants; unknown accused—under the UCMJ.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A proper claimant under this subpart includes any individual (whether civilian or military), a business, charity, or state or local government that owns, has an ownership interest in, or lawfully possesses property.</P>
                <P>(b) When cognizable claims are presented against a unit because the individual offenders cannot be identified, this subpart sets forth the procedures for approval authorities to direct pay assessments, equivalent to the amount of damages sustained, against the unit members who were present at the scene and to allocate individual liability in such proportion as is just under the circumstances.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Effect of disciplinary action, voluntary restitution, or contributory negligence for claims under the UCMJ.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Disciplinary action.</E> Administrative action under Article 139, UCMJ, and this subpart is entirely separate and distinct from disciplinary action taken under other sections of the UCMJ or other administrative actions. Because action under both Article 139, UCMJ, and this subpart requires independent findings on issues other than guilt or innocence, a soldier's conviction or acquittal of claim-related charges is not dispositive of liability under Article 139, UCMJ.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Voluntary restitution.</E> The approval authority may terminate Article 139 proceedings without findings if the soldier voluntarily makes full restitution to the claimant.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Contributory negligence.</E> A claim otherwise cognizable and meritorious is payable whether or not the claimant was negligent.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims cognizable as UCMJ claims.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Claims cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, are limited to the following:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement that conduct constructively violate UCMJ.</E> In order to subject a person to liability under Article 139, the soldier's conduct must be such as would constitute a violation of one or more punitive Articles of the UCMJ. However, a referral of charges is not a prerequisite to action under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Claims for property willfully damaged.</E> Willful damage is damage inflicted intentionally, knowingly, and purposefully without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from damage caused inadvertently, thoughtlessly or negligently. Damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by riotous, violent, or disorderly acts or acts of depredation, or through conduct showing reckless or wanton disregard of the property rights of others, may be considered willful damage.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims for property wrongfully taken.</E> A wrongful taking is any unauthorized taking or withholding of property, with the intent to deprive, temporarily or permanently, the owner or person lawfully in possession of the property. Damage, loss, or destruction of property through larceny, forgery, embezzlement, fraud, misappropriation, or similar offense may be considered wrongful taking. However, mere breach of a fiduciary or contractual duty that does not involve larceny, forgery, embezzlement, fraud, or misappropriation does not constitute wrongful taking.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Definition of property.</E> Article 139 provides compensation for loss of or damage to both personal property, whether tangible or intangible, and real property. Contrast this to the Personnel Claims Act and chapter 11 of AR 27-20, which provides compensation only for tangible personal property. Monetary losses may fall into the category of either tangible property (for example, cash), or intangible property (for example, an obligation incurred by a claimant to a third party as a result of fraudulent conduct by a soldier), although recovery for losses of intangible property may be limited by other provisions of this part, such as the exclusion of theft of services (see § 536.130(f)) or consequential damages (see § 536.130(g)).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Claims cognizable under more than one statute.</E> Claims cognizable under other claims statutes may be processed under this subpart.</P>

                <P>(b) Claims for personal injury or death.</P>

                <P>(d) Claims resulting from the conduct of Reserve component personnel who are not subject to the UCMJ at the time of the offense.</P>
                <P>(e) Subrogated claims.</P>
                <P>(f) Claims for theft of services, even if such theft constitutes a violation of Article 134 of the UCMJ.</P>
                <P>(g) Claims for indirect, remote, or consequential damages.</P>
                <P>(h) Claims by entities in conflict with the United States or whose interests are hostile to the United States.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Limitations on assessments arising from UCMJ claims.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Limitations on amount.</E> (1) A special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) has authority to approve a pay assessment in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per claimant per incident and to deny a claim in any amount. If the Judge Advocate responsible for advising the SPCMCA decides that the SPCMCA's final action under the provisions of Rule for Courts-Martial 1107 in a court-martial arising out of the same incident would be compromised, the SPCMCA may forward the Article 139 claim to the general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA) for action.</P>
                <P>(2) A GCMCA, or designee, has authority to approve a pay assessment in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per claimant per incident and to deny a claim in any amount.</P>
                <P>(i) If the GCMCA or designee determines that a claim exceeding $10,000 per claimant per incident is meritorious, that officer will assess the soldier's pay in the amount of $10,000 and forward the claim to the Commander USARCS, with a recommendation to increase the assessment.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the head of the area claims office (ACO) (usually the GCMCA's Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)) decides that the GCMCA's final action under the provisions of Rule for Courts-Martial 1107 in a court-martial arising out of the same incident would be compromised, that officer may forward the Article 139 claim to USARCS for action.</P>
                <P>(3) Only TJAG, TAJAG, the Commander USARCS, or designee has authority to approve assessments in excess of $10,000 per claimant per incident.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations on type of damages.</E> Property loss or damage assessments are limited to direct damages. This subpart does not provide redress for indirect, remote, or consequential damages.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 536.132</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Procedure for processing UCMJ claims.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Time limitations on submission of a claim.</E> A claim must be submitted within 90 days of the incident that gave rise to it, unless the SPCMCA acting on the claim determines there is good cause for delay. Lack of knowledge of the existence of Article 139, or lack of knowledge of the identity of the offender, are examples of good cause for delay.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and presentment of a claim.</E> The claimant or authorized agent may present a claim orally or in writing. If presented orally, the claim must be reduced to writing, signed, and seek a definite sum in U.S. dollars within 10 days after oral presentment.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Action upon receipt of a claim.</E> Any officer receiving a claim will forward it within two working days to the SPCMCA exercising jurisdiction over the soldier or soldiers against whom the claim is made. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction of two or more convening SPCMCAs who are under the same GCMCA, forward the claim to that GCMCA. That GCMCA will designate one SPCMCA to investigate and act on the claim as to all soldiers involved. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction of more than one SPCMCA at different locations and not under the same GCMCA, forward the claim to the SPCMCA whose headquarters is located <PRTPAGE P="209"/>nearest the situs of the alleged incident. That SPCMCA will investigate and act on the claim as to all soldiers involved. If a claim is brought against a member of one of the other military services, forward the claim to the commander of the nearest major command of that service equivalent to a major Army command (MACOM).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Action by the special court-martial convening authority.</E> (1) If the claim appears to be cognizable, the SPCMCA will appoint an investigating officer within four working days of receipt of a claim. The investigating officer will follow the procedures of this subpart supplemented by DA Pam 27-162, chapter 9, and AR 15-6, chapter 4, which applies to informal investigations. The SPCMCA may appoint the claims officer of a command (if the claims officer is a commissioned officer) as the investigating officer. In cases where the special court-martial convening authority is an inactive duty soldier of the United States Army Reserve, the appointment of an investigating officer will be made within 30 calendar days.</P>
                <P>(2) If the claim is not brought against a person who is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States at the time the claim is received, or if the claim does not appear otherwise cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, the SPCMCA may refer it for legal review (see paragraph (g) of this section) within four working days of receipt. If after legal review the SPCMCA determines that the claim is not cognizable, final action may be taken disapproving the claim (see paragraph (h) of this section) without appointing an investigating officer. In claims where the special court-martial convening authority is an inactive duty soldier of the United State Army Reserve, the request for a legal review will be made within 30 calendar days.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Expediting payment through Personnel Claims Act and Foreign Claims Act procedures.</E> When assessment action on a particular claim will be unduly delayed, the claims office supporting the SPCMA may consider the claim under the Personnel Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3721, and chapter 11 of AR 27-20, or under the Foreign Claims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2734, and subpart J of this part, as long as it is otherwise cognizable under that authority. If the Article 139 claim is later successful, the claims office will inform the claimant of the obligation to repay to the government any overpayment received under these statutes.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Action by the investigating officer.</E> The investigating officer will notify the soldier against whom the claim is made.</P>
                <P>(1) If the soldier wishes to make voluntary restitution, the investigating officer may, with the SPCMCA's concurrence, delay proceedings until the end of the next pay period to permit restitution. If the soldier makes payment to the claimant's full satisfaction, the SPCMCA will dismiss the claim.</P>
                <P>(2) In the absence of full restitution, the investigating officer will determine whether the claim is cognizable and meritorious under the provisions of Article 139, UCMJ, and this subpart, and the amount to be assessed against each offender. This amount will be reduced by any restitution the claimant accepts from an offender in partial satisfaction. Within 10 working days, or such time as the SPCMCA may determine, the IO will submit written findings and recommendations to the SPCMCA.</P>
                <P>(3) If the soldier is absent without leave and cannot be notified, a claims office may process the Article 139 claim in the soldier's absence. If an assessment is approved, forward a copy of the claim and the memorandum authorizing pay assessment by transmittal letter to the servicing Defense Accounting Office (DAO) for offset against the soldier's pay. If the soldier is dropped from the rolls, the servicing DAO will forward the assessment documents to: Commander, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), ATTN: Military Pay Operations, 8899 E. 56th Street, Indianapolis, IN 46249.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Legal review.</E> The SPCMCA will refer the claim for legal review to its servicing legal office upon either completion of the investigating officer's report or the SPCMCA's determination that the claim is not cognizable (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</P>

                <P>(1) Within five working days or such time as the SPCMCA determines, that <PRTPAGE P="210"/>office will furnish a written opinion as to:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether the claim is cognizable under the provisions of Article 139, UCMJ, and this subpart.</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether the findings and recommendations are supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
                <P>(iii) Whether the investigation substantially complies with the procedural requirements of Article 139, UCMJ; this subpart; DA Pam 27-162, chapter 9; and AR 15-6, chapter 4.</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether the claim is clearly not cognizable (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and final denial action can be taken without appointing an investigating officer.</P>
                <P>(2) If the investigating officer's recommended assessment does not exceed $5,000, the claims judge advocate (CJA) or claims attorney will, upon legal review, forward the claim to the SPCMCA for final action.</P>
                <P>(3) If the investigating officer's recommended assessment is more than $5,000, the CJA or claims attorney will, upon legal review, forward the claim file to the head of the ACO, who will also conduct a legal review within five working days.</P>
                <P>(i) If the recommended assessment does not exceed $10,000, the head of the ACO will forward the claim file to the GCMCA for final action.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the recommended assessment exceeds $10,000, the head of the ACO will forward the claim file to the GCMCA for approval of an assessment up to $10,000 and for a recommendation of an additional assessment. The head of the ACO will then forward the claims file and the GCMCA's recommendation to the Commander USARCS for approval.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Final action.</E> After consulting with the legal advisor, the approval authority will disapprove or approve the claim in an amount equal to, or less than, the amount of the assessment limitation. The approval authority is not bound by the findings or recommendations of the IO; AR 15-6, paragraph 2-3a. The approval authority will notify the claimant, and any soldier subject to that officer's jurisdiction, of the determination and the right of any party to request reconsideration (see § 536.133). A copy of the investigating officer's findings and recommendation will be enclosed with the notice. The approval authority will then suspend action on the claim for 10 working days pending receipt of a request for reconsideration, unless the approval authority determines that this delay will result in substantial injustice. If after this period the approval authority determines that an assessment is still warranted, the approval authority will direct the appropriate DAO to withhold such amount from the soldier's pay account (see § 536.131(a)). For any soldier not subject to the approval authority's jurisdiction, the approval authority will forward the claim to the commander who exercises SPCMCA jurisdiction over the soldier for assessment. The receiving SPCMCA is bound by the determination of the approval authority.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Assessment.</E> Subject to any limitations set forth in appropriate regulations, the servicing DAO will withhold the amount directed by the approval authority and pay it to the claimant. The assessment is not subject to appeal and is binding on any finance officer. If the servicing DAO cannot withhold the required amount because it does not have custody of the soldier's pay record, the record is missing, or the soldier is in a no pay due status, that office will promptly notify the approval authority of this fact in writing.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Remission of indebtedness.</E> 10 U.S.C. 4837, which authorizes the remission and cancellation of indebtedness of an enlisted person to the United States or its instrumentalities, is not applicable and may not be used to remit and cancel indebtedness determined as a result of action under Article 139, UCMJ.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 536.133</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Reconsideration of UCMJ claims.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Although Article 139, UCMJ, does not provide for a right of appeal, either the claimant or a soldier whose pay is assessed may request the approval authority (SPCMCA or GCMCA, depending on the amount assessed) or successor in command to reconsider the action. Either party must submit such a request for reconsideration in writing and clearly state the factual or legal basis for the relief requested. The approval authority may <PRTPAGE P="211"/>direct that the matter be reinvestigated.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reconsideration by the original approval authority.</E> The original approval authority may reconsider the action at any time while serving as the approval authority for the claim in question, even after the transfer of the soldier whose pay was assessed. The original approval authority may modify the action if it was incorrect, subject to paragraph (d) of this section. However, the approval authority should modify the action only because of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake of law.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reconsideration by a successor in command.</E> Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a successor in command may modify an action only because of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake of law apparent on the face of the record.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Legal review and action.</E> Prior to modifying the original action, the approval authority will have the servicing claims office render a legal opinion and fully explain the basis for modification as part of the file. If the legal review agrees that a return of the assessed pay is appropriate, the approval authority should request in writing that the claimant return the money, setting forth in the letter the basis for the request. There is no authority for repayment from appropriated funds.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Disposition of files.</E> After completing action on reconsideration, the approval authority will forward the reconsideration action to the servicing claims office, which will then file the action per § 536.132(h).</P>

                <P>(a) The statutory authority for this subpart is the Act of August 10, 1956, 10 U.S.C. 2734 (70 Stat. 154), commonly referred to as the Foreign Claims Act (FCA), as amended by Public Law 86-223, September 1959 (73 Stat. 453); Public Law 86-411, April 1960 (74 Stat. 16); Public Law 90-521, September 1968 (82 Stat. 874); Public Law 91-312, July 1970 (84 Stat. 412); Public Law 93-336, July 1974 (88 Stat. 292); Public Law 96-513, Title V, § 511 (95), December 1980 (94 Stat. 2928). It is posted on the USARCS Web site; for the address see § 536.2(a).</P>

                <P>(b) Claims arising from the acts or omissions of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia are settled in accordance with Art. XV, Non-contractual Claims, of the U.S.-Marshall Islands and Micronesian Status of Forces Agreement (the “SOFA”) (posted on the USARCS Web site; for the address see § 536.2(a)). This is pursuant to the “agreed upon minutes” that are appended to the SOFA, pursuant to Section 323 of the Compact of Free Association between the U.S. and the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, enacted by Public Law 99-239, January 14, 1986. (The Compact may be viewed at <E T="03">http://www.fm/jcn/compact/relindex.html</E>). The “agreed upon minutes” state that “all claims within the scope of paragraph 1 of Article XV [Claims], [of the Compact] * * * shall be processed and settled exclusively pursuant to the Foreign Claims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2734, and any regulations promulgated in implementation thereof.” Therefore, Title I, Article 178 of the Compact, regarding claims processing, is not applicable to claims arising from the acts or omissions of the U.S. armed forces, but only to other federal agencies. Those agencies are required to follow the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 2672.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims payable under the Foreign Claims Act.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A claim for death, personal injury, or loss of or damage to property may be allowed under this subpart if the alleged damage results from noncombat activity or a negligent or wrongful act or omission of soldiers or civilian employees of the U.S. armed forces, as enumerated in § 536.23(b), regardless of whether the act or omission was made within the scope of their employment. This includes non-U.S. citizen employees recruited elsewhere but employed in a country of which they are not a citizen. However, a claim generated by non-U.S. citizen employees in the country in which they were recruited and are employed will be payable only if the act or omission was made in the scope of employment. But claims arising from the operation of U.S. armed forces vehicles or other equipment by such employees may be paid, even though the employees are not acting within the scope of their employment, provided the employer or owner of the vehicle or other equipment would be liable under local law in the circumstances involved.</P>
                <P>(b) Claims generated by officers or civilian employees of the American Battle Monuments Commission (36 U.S.C. 2110), acting within the scope of employment, will be paid from American Battle Monuments Commission appropriations.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(i) Is presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict with the United States, or any country allied with such enemy country unless the appropriate settlement authority determines that the claimant is, and at the time of the incident was friendly to the United States. A prisoner of war or an interned enemy alien is not excluded from filing a claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property within the federal government's custody if the claim is otherwise payable.</P>
                <P>(j) Is for damages or injury, the claim for which a receiving State should adjudicate and pay pursuant to an international agreement, subject to waiver by the Commander USARCS. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 3-4a(2), for a discussion of the conditions of waiver.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Applicable law for claims under the Foreign Claims Act.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Venue of incident and domicile of claimant.</E> In determining an appropriate award, apply the law and custom of the country in which the incident occurred to determine which elements of damages are payable and which individuals are entitled to compensation. However, where the claimant is an inhabitant of another foreign country and only temporarily within the country in which the incident occurred, the quantum of certain elements of damages, such as lost wages and future medical care, may be calculated based on the law and economic conditions in the country of the claimant's permanent residence. Where the decedent is the subject of a wrongful death case, the quantum will be determined based on the country of the decedent's permanent residence regardless of the fact that his survivors live in the U.S. or a different foreign country than the decedent. See § 536.77 for further damages guidance.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Other guidance.</E> The guidance set forth in §§ 536.77(b) through (d) as to allowable elements of damages is generally applicable. Where moral damages, as defined in DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-53c(4), are permitted, such damages are payable. In some countries it is customary to get a professional appraisal to substantiate certain claims and pass this cost on to the tortfeasor. The Commander USARCS or the chief of a command claims service may, as an exception to policy, permit the reimbursement of such costs in appropriate cases. Where feasible, claimants should be discouraged from incurring such costs.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Deductions for insurance.</E> (1) Insurance coverage recovered or recoverable will be deducted from any award. In that regard, every effort will be made to monitor the insurance aspect of the case and encourage direct settlement between the claimant and the insurer of the tortfeasor.</P>

                <P>(2) When efforts under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are of no avail, or when it otherwise is determined that an insurance settlement will not be reasonably available for application to the award, no award will be made until the chief of the command claims service or the Commander USARCS, has first granted consent. In such cases, an assignment of the insured's rights against the insurer will be obtained and, in appropriate cases, reimbursement action will be instituted against the insurer under applicable procedures.<PRTPAGE P="214"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) If an insurance settlement is not available due to the insurer's insolvency or bankruptcy, a report on the bankruptcy will be forwarded to the Commander USARCS without delay, setting forth all pertinent information, including the alleged reasons for the bankruptcy and the facts concerning the licensing of the insurer.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Deductions for amounts paid by tortfeasor.</E> Settlement authorities will deduct from the damages any direct payments by a member or civilian employee of the U.S. armed forces for damages (other than solatia).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Appointment and functions of Foreign Claims Commissions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Claims cognizable under this subpart will be referred to the command responsible for claims arising within its geographic area of responsibility, including claims transferred by agreement between the services involved. The senior judge advocate of a command having a command claims service, or his delegee, will appoint a sufficient number of Foreign Claims Commissions (FCCs) to dispose of the claims. If there is no command claims service, the responsible commander may ask the Commander USARCS for permission to establish one. Otherwise, the Commander USARCS will appoint a sufficient number of FCCs from personnel furnished by the command involved. See § 576.3(d) for more information about command claims services.</P>
                <P>(b) The Commander USARCS will appoint all other FCCs to act on all other claims, regardless of where such claims arose, unless they arose in a country for which single-service responsibility has been assigned to another service. FCCs appointed by the Commander USARCS at units based in the continental United States (CONUS) may act on any claim arising out of such unit's operations. Any FCC operating in, or adjudicating claims arising out of, a geographical area within a command claims service's jurisdiction, will comply with that service's legal and procedural rules.</P>
                <P>(c) An FCC may operate as an integral part of a command claims service, which will determine the cases to be assigned to it, furnish necessary administrative services, and establish and maintain its records. Where an FCC does not operate as part of a command claims service, it may operate as part of the office or a division, corps or higher command staff judge advocate (SJA), which will perform the foregoing functions.</P>
                <P>(d) An appointing authority who appoints or relieves an FCC whom he or she has appointed will forward one copy of each order addressing an FCC's appointment, relief, or change of responsibility to the Commander USARCS. Upon receipt of an initial appointing order, the Commander USARCS will assign an office code number to the FCC. Without such a number the FCC has no authority to approve or pay claims. See AR 27-20, paragraph 13-1.</P>
                <P>(e) Normally, the FCC is responsible for the investigation of all claims referred to it, using both the procedures set forth in subpart B of this part and any local procedures established by the appointing authority or command claims service responsible for the geographical area in which the claim arose. Chiefs of a command claims service may request assistance on claims investigation within their geographical areas from units or organizations other than the FCC. The Commander USARCS may make the same request for any claim referred to an FCC appointed under his or her authority.</P>

                <P>(f) When an FCC intends to deny a claim, or offer an award less than the amount claimed, it will notify in writing the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or legal representative of the intended action on the claim and the legal and factual bases for that action. If the FCC proposes a partial award, a settlement agreement should be enclosed with the notice. Claimants will be advised that they may either accept the FCC action by returning the signed settlement agreement or, if dissatisfied with the FCC's action, they may submit a request for reconsideration stating the factual or legal reasons why they believe the FCC's proposed action is incorrect. This notice serves to give the claimant an opportunity to request reconsideration of the FCC action and state the reasons for the request before final action is <PRTPAGE P="215"/>taken on the claim. When the FCC intends to award the amount claimed, or recommend an award equal to the amount claimed to a higher authority, this procedure is not necessary. However, a settlement agreement is required for all awards, full or partial. See § 536.63(a).</P>
                <P>(1) This notice should be given at least 30 days before the FCC takes final action, except on small claims processed pursuant to § 536.33. The notice should be mailed via certified or registered mail to the claimant. The claimant should be informed that any request for reconsideration should be addressed to the FCC that took final action, and that all materials the claimant wishes the FCC to consider should be included with the request for reconsideration.</P>
                <P>(2) An FCC may alter its initial decision based on the claimant's response or proceed with the intended action. If the claimant's response raises a general policy issue, the FCC may request an advisory opinion from the Commander USARCS or the chief of the command claims service while retaining the claim for final action at its level.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon completing of its evaluation of the claimant's response, the FCC will notify the claimant of its final decision and advise the claimant that its action is final and conclusive as a matter of law (10 U.S.C. 2735), unless the final decision is a recommendation for payment above its authority. In that case, the FCC will forward any response submitted by the claimant along with its claims memorandum of opinion to the approval authority, and will notify the claimant accordingly.</P>
                <P>(4) When an FCC determines that a claim is valued at more than $50,000 or all claims arising out of a single incident are valued at more than $100,000, the file will be transferred to the Commander USARCS for further action; see § 536.143(d)(2). Upon request of the Commander USARCS, the FCC may negotiate a settlement, the amount of which exceeds the FCC's authority; however, prior approval by a higher authority is required.</P>
                <P>(5) Every reasonable effort should be made to negotiate a mutually agreeable settlement on meritorious claims. When an agreement can be reached, the notice and response provisions above are not necessary. If the FCC recommends an award in excess of its monetary authority, the settlement agreement should indicate that its recommendation is contingent upon approval by higher authority.</P>
                <P>(g) The chief of an overseas command claims service may delegate to a one-member FCC the responsibility for the receipt, processing, and investigation of any claim, regardless of amount, except those required to be referred to a receiving State office for adjudication under the provisions of a treaty concerning the status of U.S. forces in the country in which the claim arose. If, after investigation, it appears that action by a three-member FCC is appropriate, the one-member FCC should send the claim to the appropriate three-member FCC with a complete investigation report, including a discussion of the applicable local law and a recommendation for disposition.</P>

                <P>(a) Normally, an FCC will be composed of either one or three members. Alternate members of three-member FCCs may be appointed when circumstances require, and may be substituted for regular members on specific cases by order of the appointing authority. The appointing orders will clearly designate the president of a three-member FCC. Two members of a three-member FCC will constitute a quorum, and the FCC's decision will be determined by majority vote.</P>
                <P>(b) Upon approval by the Commander USARCS and the appropriate authority of another uniformed service, the membership may be composed of one or more members of another uniformed service. If another service has single-service responsibility over the foreign country in which the claim arose, that service is responsible for the claim. If requested, the Commander USARCS may furnish a JAG officer or claims attorney to be a member of another service's FCC.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Qualification of members of Foreign Claims Commissions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Normally, a member of an FCC will be either a commissioned officer or a claims attorney. At least two members of a three-member FCC must be JAs or claims attorneys. In exigent circumstances, a qualified non-lawyer employee of the armed forces may be appointed to an FCC, subject to prior approval by the Commander USARCS. Such approval may be granted only upon a showing of the employee's status and qualifications and adequate justification for such appointment (for example, lack of legally qualified personnel). The FCC will be limited to employees who are citizens of the United States. An officer, claims attorney, or employee of another armed force will be appointed a member of an Army FCC only if approved by the Commander USARCS.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Settlement authority of Foreign Claims Commissions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In order to determine whether the claim will be considered by a one-member or three-member FCC, the claimed amount will be converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent (based on the annual Foreign Currency Fluctuation Account exchange rate, where applicable). However, the FCC's jurisdiction to approve is determined by the conversion rate on the date of final action. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar has decreased, the FCC will forward the recommendation to a higher authority, if necessary.</P>
                <P>(b) Payment will be made in the currency of the country in which the incident occurred or in which the claimant resided at the time of the incident, unless the claimant requests payment in U.S. dollars or another currency and such request is approved by the chief of a command claims service or the Commander USARCS. However, if the claimant resides in another foreign country at the time of payment, payment in an amount equivalent to that which would have been paid under the preceding sentence may be made in the currency of that third country without the approval of the Commander USARCS.</P>
                <P>(c) A one-member FCC may consider and pay claims presented in any amount provided a mutually agreed settlement may be reached in an amount not exceeding the FCC's monetary authority. A one-member FCC may deny any claim when the claimed amount does not exceed its monetary authority. Unless otherwise restricted by the appointing authority, a one-member FCC who is a JA or claims attorney has $15,000 monetary authority, while any other one-member commission has $5,000 monetary authority.</P>
                <P>(d) A three-member FCC, unless otherwise restricted by the appointing authority, may take the following actions on a claim that is properly before it:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Disapprove a claim presented in any amount.</E> After following the procedures in § 536.140, including reconsideration, the disapproval is final and conclusive under 10 U.S.C. 2735. The FCC will inform the appointing authority of its action. After it takes final action and disapproves a claim presented in any amount over $50,000, the FCC will forward to the appointing authority the written notice to the claimant required by § 536.140(f), any response from the claimant, and its notice of final action on the claim.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Approve and pay meritorious claims presented in any amount.</E> (i) Claims paid in full or in part for an amount not exceeding $50,000 will be paid after any reconsideration as set forth in § 536.140. This action is final and conclusive under 10 U.S.C. 2735.</P>
                <P>(ii) Claims valued at an amount exceeding $50,000, or multiple claims arising from the same incident valued at more than $100,000, will be forwarded through the appointing authority with a memorandum of opinion to the Commander USARCS for action; see DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-60. The memorandum of opinion will discuss the amount for which the claimant will settle and include the recommendation of the FCC.</P>

                <P>(e) The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), The Assistant Judge Advocate General (TAJAG) and the Commander USARCS, or his or her designee serving at USARCS, may approve and pay, in whole or in part, any claim as long as the amount of the award does not exceed $100,000; may disapprove any claim, regardless of either the amount <PRTPAGE P="217"/>claimed or the recommendation of the FCC forwarding the claim; or, if a claim is forwarded to USARCS for approval of payment in excess of $50,000, refer the claim back to the FCC or another FCC for further action.</P>
                <P>(f) Payments in excess of $100,000 will be approved by the Secretary of the Army, the Army General Counsel as the Secretary's designee, or other designee of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(g) Following approval where required and receipt of an agreement by the claimant accepting the specific sum awarded by the FCC, the claim will be processed for payment in the appropriate currency. The first $100,000 of any award will be paid from Army claims funds. The excess will be reported to the Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, with the documents listed in DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-81.</P>
                <P>(h) If the settlement authority upholds a final offer or authorizes an award on appeal from a denial of a claim, the notice of the settlement authority's action will inform the claimant that he or she must accept the award within 180 days of the date of mailing of the notice of the settlement authority's action or the award will be withdrawn, the claim will be deemed denied, and the file will be closed without future recourse.</P>

In the absence of such a request, the settlement authority may reconsider a claim on its own initiative.</P>
                <P>(2) An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct action on an FCA claim previously settled in whole or in part (even if a settlement agreement has been executed) when it appears that the original action was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidence of record at the time of the action or subsequently received. For errors in fact, the new evidence must not have been discoverable at the time of final action by either the Army or the claimant through the exercise of reasonable diligence. Corrective action may also be taken when an error contrary to the parties' mutual understanding is discovered in the original action. If it is determined that the original action was incorrect, the action will be modified, and if appropriate, a supplemental payment made. The basis for a change in action will be stated in a memorandum included in the file. For example, a claim was settled for $15,000, but the settlement agreement was typed to read “$1,500” and the error is not discovered until the file is being prepared for payment. If appropriate, a corrected payment will be made. A settlement authority who has reason to believe that a settlement was obtained by fraud on the part of the claimant or the claimant's legal representative, will reopen action on that claim and, if the belief is substantiated, correct the action. The basis for correcting an action will be stated in a memorandum and included in the file.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Settlement correction.</E> A successor approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's action on a claim that was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons that an original authority may do so.</P>

No further requests for reconsideration will be allowed except on the basis of fraud.</P>

However, when the Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) is protected by a commercial insurer (for example, flying and parachute activities), the claim will be referred to the insurer as outlined in § 536.148(d). See Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 5515.6, dated November 3, 1956, posted on the USARCS Web site (see § 536.2(a)).</P>
                <P>(1) Claims arising within the United States, its territories, commonwealths, or possessions. Such claims will be processed in the manner prescribed by subparts C, D, E, F, H or J of this part, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(2) Claims arising outside the United States, its territories, commonwealths, or possessions. Such claims will be processed in accordance with the provisions of applicable Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) or in the manner prescribed by subparts C, D, E, F, H or J of this part, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reporting and investigation.</E> Such claims will be investigated in accordance with AR 215-1 and subpart B of this part.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> Personal injury, death, or property damage resulting from vehicular collisions, falls, falling objects, assaults, or accidents of similar nature will be reported immediately to the person in charge of the NAFI or activity at which it occurred. The report should be made by the employee who initially received notice of the incident, even if the individual involved denies sustaining personal injury or property damage. Upon receipt of the report of the incident, the person in charge of the NAF activity concerned <PRTPAGE P="219"/>will transmit the report to the area claims office (ACO) or claims processing office (CPO) for investigation.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Investigation.</E> Claims arising out of acts or omissions of employees of NAF activities will be investigated in the manner set forth in subpart B of this part. A determination as to whether the claim is cognizable under this section will be made as soon as practicable.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Customer complaints.</E> AAFES-generated complaints will be handled in accordance with Exchange Service Manual 57-2. NAFI-generated complaints will be handled in accordance with AR 215-1, chapter 3. Complaints generated by appropriated funds laundry and dry-cleaning operations will be handled in accordance with AR 210-130, chapter 2. Complaints generated by refunds of sales proceeds will be handled in accordance with Exchange Operating Procedures (EOP) 57-2.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Commercial insurance.</E> Certain NAFI activities (such as flying and parachute activities, and all AAFES concessionaires) may have private commercial insurance.</P>
                <P>(1) A claims investigation under subpart B of this part will not be conducted except when the claim's estimated value may exceed the insurance policy limits. In that event, the Commander USARCS, will be notified immediately and an investigation will be conducted with a view to determining whether the United States may be liable under subparts C, D, F, H or J of this part. Otherwise, the ACO or CPO will refer the claim to the insurer and furnish copies to the USARCS AAO, as required in AR 27-20, paragraph 2-12. Assistance will be furnished to the insurer as needed. Copies of any other required investigations may be furnished to the insurer.</P>
                <P>(2) The claim will be reviewed at key intervals to ensure that progress is being made, negotiations are properly conducted, and the file is closed. The Commander USARCS will be advised of any problems.</P>
                <P>(3) If requested by either the insurer or NAFI officials, the appropriate claims authority will assist in or conduct negotiations.</P>
                <P>(4) Where NAFI vehicles are required to be covered by insurance in foreign countries, the insurer will process the claim. However, if the policy coverage limit is exceeded or the insurer is insolvent, the claim may be processed under subpart G, §§ 536.114 through 536.116 (Claims arising overseas) or, if subpart G does not apply, under subparts C or J of this part. See § 536.139(c) for additional guidance.</P>

                <P>The risk management program (RIMP) is administered by the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center under the provisions of AR 215-1 and AR 608-10 (Family Child Care Provider Claims). Providers in order to encourage authorized personnel, that is, military and civilian employees, to use the family child care program and sports equipment, such claims are processed in a manner similar to NAFI claims in §§ 536.146 through 536.152 of this subpart. Certain claims are payable from nonappropriated funds even though the U.S. is not liable under the FTCA or the MCA as the tortfeasor is not an appropriated fund or nonappropriated fund employee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims payable involving tortfeasors other than nonappropriated fund employees.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Non-NAFI RIMP claims can arise from the activities of:</P>

                <P>(1) Members of NAFIs or authorized users of NAFI sports equipment or devices for recreational purposes, while <PRTPAGE P="221"/>using such property, except real property, in the manner and for the purposes authorized by DA regulations and the charter, constitution, and bylaws of the particular NAF activity.</P>
                <P>(2) Family child care providers, authorized members of the provider's household and approved substitute providers while care under the family child care program is being provided in the manner prescribed in AR 608-10, except as excluded below. Such claims are generally limited to injuries to, or death of, children receiving care under the family child care program that are caused by the negligence of authorized providers. Claims arising from the transportation of such children in motor vehicles and claims involving loss of or damage to property are not cognizable.</P>
                <P>(b) An ACO or a CPO will ask the Commander USARCS for an advisory opinion prior to settling any non-NAFI RIMP claim where the person whose conduct generated liability does not fall clearly within the categories listed above. Such authorities may also ask, through the Commander USARCS, for an advisory opinion from the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center prior to settling any claim arising under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, where it is not clear that the injured or deceased child was receiving care within the scope of the family child care program.</P>
                <P>(c) Where liability has been determined to exist for both non-NAFI RIMP and APF activities, liability will be apportioned between the two activities.</P>
                <P>(d) The total payment for all claims (including derivative claims), arising as a result of injury to, or death of, any one person is limited to $500,000 for each incident. Continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same or similar harmful activity or conditions is treated as one incident for purposes of determining the limits of liability.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Investigation.</E> ACOs and CPOs are responsible for the investigation of non-NAFI RIMP claims. Such investigation will be closely coordinated with program managers responsible for the activity generating the claim. Close coordination with USARCS is also required, and USARCS will maintain mirror files containing the investigative materials of all actual and potential claims.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment.</E> Non-NAFI RIMP claims will be transmitted for payment to: The Army Central Insurance Fund, ATTN: CFSC-FM-I, 4700 King Street, Alexandria, VA 22302-4406.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recovery for government property loss or damage.</E> The FCCA, originally passed in 1966, gives federal agencies the authority to collect a claim of the United States government for money or property arising out of the activities of the agency in question. However, the broad authority is limited for purposes of this regulation to claims for loss of or damage to property, as the FMCRA takes precedence for medical care recoveries.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Recovery for medical expenses and lost military pay.</E> (1) The FMCRA, passed in 1962, authorizes recovery from a third person of the expenses for medical care the United States furnishes to a person who is injured or suffers a disease when such care is authorized or required by law. Likewise the United States is authorized to recover the cost of pay for members of the uniformed services unable to perform duties. Recovery normally arises out of a third-party tort under local law as to which the United States has an independent cause of action.</P>
              <P>(2) Under 10 U.S.C. 1095 the United States is also deemed a third-party beneficiary or subrogee under an alternative system of computations such as workers' compensation; hospital lien laws; contract rights under the terms of insurance policies including medical payment coverage; uninsured, underinsured and no-fault coverage; and no-fault laws.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Recovery of health insurance.</E> 10 U.S.C. 1095 permits recovery of health insurance for medical care furnished at military medical treatment facilities (MTFs), including supplemental policies. This third-party collection program has been delegated to the Surgeon General of the Army by the Judge Advocate General (TJAG).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Worldwide applicability.</E> The foregoing authorities are worldwide in application, except for intergovernmental <PRTPAGE P="223"/>claims waived by treaty, for example, North Atlantic Treaty Association Status of Forces Agreement (NATO SOFA), Article VIII, paragraph 1.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicable law.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for recovery.</E> (1) Most recovery assertions are based on the negligence or wrongful acts or omissions of the person or entity that caused the loss. These actions or omissions must constitute a tort as determined by the law of place of occurrence, except in no-fault jurisdictions where the no-fault law permits recovery. Where the tort is not complete within the jurisdiction where it originally occurred, the law of the original jurisdiction is nevertheless applicable. For example, if a plane crashes in Virginia due to the negligence of a Federal Aviation Administration controller in Maryland, Maryland law determines the extent and nature of the tort. However, as to what law of damages is applicable, Maryland or Virginia depecage (choice of law) theory may apply. For example, if the flight originated in Indiana and the destination was Virginia, the conflict law of both Maryland and Virginia must be applied. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-35.</P>
              <P>(2) Recovery assertions based on the United States being a third-party beneficiary or subrogee are not based on tort, but on the right to recover under local law, for example, the right of a third party to recover workers' compensation benefits is based on local law. However, the right of a third-party beneficiary to recover under an insurance contract may turn on whether an exclusionary clause is valid under the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was made.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Statute of limitations.</E> (1) Federal law determines when a recovery assertion must be made. Assertions for the <PRTPAGE P="224"/>value of medical expenses, lost military pay or property loss or damage based on a tort must be made not later than three years from the date of accrual, 28 U.S.C. 2415(b). The date of accrual is usually the date of the occurrence giving rise to the recovery, for example, the date of injury or death for medical expenses and lost military pay or the date of damage or loss for a government property assertion. There are exceptions. For example, the loss of property in rightful possession of another accrues when that person claims ownership or converts the property to his own use.</P>

              <P>(2) Recovery assertions based on an implied-in-law contract against a no-fault or personal-injury-protection insured must be brought no later than six years from the date of accrual, 28 U.S.C. 2415(a), <E T="03">United States</E> v. <E T="03">Limbs,</E> 524 F.2d 799 (9th Cir. 1975). The date of accrual is usually the date of occurrence.</P>

              <P>(3) Actions asserted on a third-party beneficiary basis against an insurer or workers compensation fund must comply with the state notice requirement, which varies from one to six years, or the insurer's notice requirement set forth in the policy. <E T="03">United States</E> v. <E T="03">Hartford Acci. &amp; Indem. Co.,</E> 460 F.2d 17 (9th Cir. 1972), cert. den. 409 U.S. 979 (1972).</P>

              <P>(4) The statute of limitations is tolled or does not start running until the responsible federal official is notified of the existence of a recoverable loss, <E T="03">Jankowitz</E> v. <E T="03">United States,</E> 533 F.2d 538 (D.C. Cir. 1976), <E T="03">United States</E> v. <E T="03">Golden Acres, Inc.,</E> 684 F. Supp. 96 (D. Del. 1986). The responsible federal official can be the area claims office (ACO), the claims processing office (CPO), a command claims service or USARCS, depending on who receives the notice under this regulation. However, because of the responsibility to notify the MTF or TRICARE fiscal intermediary, and by regulation the notice must be expeditious, delayed notification could start the statute of limitations running. Additionally, when an ACO or CPO discovers the existence of an assertion, the statute of limitations will begin to run regardless of when the MTF or the TRICARE intermediary sends a notice. The date of receipt of a notice must be entered into the affirmative claims management program/database (ACMP) and the notice must be date-stamped and initialed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Identification of recovery incidents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Responsibilities.</E> Each command claims service and ACO will develop means to identify recovery incidents arising in its geographic area of responsibility. See §§ 536.10 and 536.11 of this chapter and paragraph 2-2 of DA Pam 27-162. This requires publication of a claims directive to all DOD and Army installations, units and activities in its area, emphasizing the importance of reporting serious incidents to recovery judge advocates (RJAs) or civilian recovery attorneys.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Screening procedures.</E> (1) Establish a point of contact in each unit and activity in the area of responsibility and screen their sources periodically, including motor pools, family housing, departments of public works, safety offices, provost marshals, and criminal investigation divisions. Review civilian news and police reports, military police blotters and reports, court proceedings, line of duty and AR 15-6 investigations and similar sources to identify potential medical care recovery claims.</P>

              <P>(2) The MTF commander will ensure that the claims office is notified of instances in which the MTF provides, or is billed by a civilian facility for, inpatient or outpatient care resulting from injuries (such as broken bones or burns arising from automobile accidents, gas explosions, falls, civilian malpractice, and similar incidents) that do not involve collections from a health benefits or Medicare supplemental insurer. Claims personnel will coordinate with MTF personnel to ensure that inpatient and outpatient records and emergency room and clinic logs are properly screened to identify potential cases. The RJA or recovery attorney will screen the MTF comptroller records database and division records as well as ambulance logs to identify potential medical care recovery cases. The RJA or recovery attorney will also coordinate with Navy and Air Force claims <PRTPAGE P="225"/>offices and MTFs to ensure they identify potential claims involving treatment provided to Army personnel.</P>
              <P>(3) The MTF commander will also ensure that the MTF does not release billings or medical records, or respond to requests for assistance with workers' compensation forms, without coordinating with the RJA or recovery attorney.</P>
              <P>(4) The TRICARE fiscal intermediary is required to identify and mail certain information promptly to the claims office designated as the state point of contact. The fiscal intermediary must mail the TRICARE Explanation of Benefits, showing the amount TRICARE paid on the claim along with what diagnostic codes were used, and DD Form 2527, Statement of Personal Injury. A sample Statement of Personal Injury (DD Form 2527) is posted on the USARCS Web site; for the address see the Note to § 537.1.</P>
              <P>(5) The RJA or recovery attorney will also coordinate with Navy and Air Force claims offices and MTFs to ensure they identify potential claims involving treatment provided to Army personnel, AR 40-400, paragraph 13-5.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">When to open a recovery file.</E> (1) Upon identification of a potential recovery incident or upon receipt of a billing from a TRICARE Fiscal Intermediary or an MTF, a file will be opened and entered into the ACMP by the first ACO or CPO that learns of the event even if liability has not been established. Incidents under Navy, Air Force or Coast Guard jurisdiction will not be so entered but referred to the responsible service. Complete listings of claims/recovery offices worldwide are posted on the USARCS Web site; for the address see the Note to § 537.1. At the site, select the link “Claims Resources.” At the next screen, click on “Tables Listing Claims Offices Worldwide.”).</P>
              <P>(2) Army responsibility for affirmative claims is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Damage to or loss of real or personal property of the DOD or the Army even if located at installations or activities under the jurisdiction of other uniformed services.</P>
              <P>(ii) Personal injury to persons whose primary care for an accident-related injury is furnished at an Army MTF, regardless of the uniformed services affiliation of the person or sponsor, but not to those treated at another uniformed service's MTF even if the person is an active duty Army member.</P>
              <P>(iii) Personal injury to an active duty or retired Army member or a family member of either category treated under TRICARE.</P>
              <P>(iv) A lead agency will be established whenever:</P>
              <P>(A) Property damaged or lost belonging to more than one service is involved in the same incident.</P>
              <P>(B) Personal injury victims are treated at MTFs of more than one service.</P>
              <P>(C) Personal injury victims with affiliations to more than one service are treated under TRICARE.</P>
              <P>(D) Lead agencies may be established locally for claims valued at $50,000 or less. For claims greater than $50,000 USARCS will be notified and will deal with the other service at headquarters level. (See § 536.32 of this chapter.)</P>

              <P>Upon receipt of notice of a claim involving either actual or potential amounts within USARCS' monetary jurisdiction, that is, where final action will be taken by USARCS or the Department of Justice, immediate notice will be given to USARCS. Forwarding a copy of the serious incident report, discussed in § 536.22(c) of this chapter, to USARCS, will meet this requirement. Thereafter, mirror file copies will be furnished to USARCS in accordance with AR 27-20, paragraph 2-12. This allows for continuous monitoring and discussion between the ACO and the USARCS area action officer (AAO).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Investigation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Claims over $50,000.</E> Hands-on investigation will be conducted by claims personnel as set forth in DA Pam 27-162, Chapter 2, Section IV, regardless of the amount of insurance coverage immediately available, with a view to discovery of other sources of recovery, for example, vehicle defects or improper maintenance, road design and absence of warning signs, products liability, medical malpractice in civilian treatment facilities. Where the employment <PRTPAGE P="226"/>of experts is indicated follow the procedures in § 536.39 of this chapter. No attorney representation agreement will be sent to the injured party's representative without USARCS approval.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Claims of $50,000 or less.</E> The amount of hands-on investigative effort is directly related to the amount of insurance coverage that the tortfeasor possesses and the amount of coverage that the injured party has. Where the injured party is represented, request information from his lawyer or insurer, in addition to the documents obtained in initial screening. The ACO should be able to form an independent opinion as to liability based on the investigation of the government and not solely on that of the injured party's attorney.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims of $5,000 or less.</E> Small claims procedures are applicable to the extent feasible. See § 536.33 of this chapter. Investigation, assertion and settlement by e-mail, phone or fax is encouraged. The investigation and action should be recorded. DA Form 1668, Small Claims Certificate, may be used as a model, modifying it as needed. A sample completed Small Claims Certificate is posted at USARCS Web site for the address see the Note to § 537.1.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Relations with injured party.</E> (1) When the injured party becomes known and an interview can be conducted locally, all relevant facts will be obtained unless the injured party is represented by a lawyer. In this latter event, basic information as set forth on DD Form 2527, Statement of Personal Injury (a completed sample is posted at the USARCS Web site; for the address see the Note to § 537.1) can be obtained without violating lawyer-client privilege. If the injured party is not immediately available, the information can be obtained by requesting assistance from another ACO, a unit claims officer, a reservist or Army National Guard (ANG) member, another federal agency, or another means.</P>
              <P>(2) When the injured party is represented, a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) medical release form (sample posted at the USARCS Web site; see § 537 (b)(4)) permitting USARCS to send out the medical records of the injured party for claims purposes, will be sent to the injured party's lawyer for completion and return.</P>
              <P>(3) When the injured party or his or her lawyer refuses to furnish necessary information, it can usually be obtained by other means, for example, from an accident report or investigation. A notice will be furnished to all parties that the government has been assigned the right to bring a claim for the value of medical care furnished, lost pay or value of property lost or destroyed, and that the United States has the right to bring an independent cause of action. In absence of timely and appropriate response, discuss with the AAO to determine what action should be taken.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assertion.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Asserting demands.</E> If a prima facie claim exists under state law, a written demand will be made against all the tortfeasors and insurers. This includes demands against the injured party's own insurance coverage, no-fault coverage and workers' compensation carrier. The earlier the demand the better. A demand will not be delayed until the exact amount of medical expenses or lost pay is determined. The demand letter will state that the amount will be furnished when known. A copy of the demand will be furnished to the injured party or, if represented, his lawyer. Two sample demand (or assertion) letters are posted at the USARCS Web site (for the address see the Note to § 537.1). Demand letters are for initial contact with insurance companies. One of the posted samples is for a medical assertion for a soldier (that includes wages). The other is for a medical assertion for a civilian (that does not include wages). Remember the following points when asserting demands:</P>
              <P>(1) The fact that the medical expenses have been assigned to the United States and as a result the United States has a cause of action in federal or state court. All parties will be notified that if the insurer pays the amount to another party, the United States has the right to collect from the insurer.</P>

              <P>(2) Demands for third-party torts are under the authority of the FMCRA; demands where there is no tortfeasor are under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1095; <PRTPAGE P="227"/>demands for property loss or damage are under the authority of the FCCA.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation of damages.</E> MTFs are required by AR 40-400, Patient Administration, chapter 13 to furnish complete billing documents to RJAs.</P>
              <P>(1) TRICARE bills are obtained from the fiscal intermediary servicing the ACO. The amounts are based on the amount TRICARE pays and not the amount the patient is billed by the provider. TRICARE bills must be screened to insure that the care is incident or accident related as the demand is limited to that amount.</P>
              <P>(2) MTF bills, both outpatient and inpatient, are obtained from either the MTF co-located with the ACO or if another MTF is involved, from that MTF, regardless of uniformed service affiliation. Outpatient bills include not only the cost of the visit but also the cost of each procedure, such as x-rays or laboratory tests. Inpatient billing is not based on services rendered but on a diagnostic group. Charges for professional inpatient services will be itemized the same as outpatient care. Charges for prescription services will be included. Screening to ensure that only incident or accident related care is claimed is essential. The cost of ambulance services, ground or air, will be calculated with MTF assistance and demanded. Burial expenses are obtained from the local mortuary affairs office on DD Form 2063, but will be demanded only when the insurance coverage includes such expenses.</P>
              <P>(3) Lost pay will be obtained from the leave or earnings statement or the active duty pay chart for the year or years in question and will include special and incentive pay unless the injured service member did not receive either due to the length of time off assigned duty. The time off duty will be based on the time service members are unable to perform duties for which they have been trained (their military occupational specialty). It will not be limited to inpatient time. Time in a medical holding or convalescent leave will be lost time.</P>
              <P>(4) The amount recoverable for personal property losses is limited to its value at the time of loss. Depreciation charts may be used to determine the reduction from the value at purchase. Replacement value will not be used. Both real and personal property damage will be on the value of labor and cost of material including the use of heavy equipment. When the cost of repairs is greater than $50,000, 10% overhead will be added. This can be substantiated using case law and by seeking documentation from the repair facility.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Double collections prohibited.</E> When the cost of medical care is recoverable by the MTF from medical care insurance, both primary and supplemental under 10 U.S.C. 1095, an assertion under FMCRA will be made, including a demand for lost pay not recoverable out of health insurance. While the United States is entitled to recover costs of medical care from both the injured parties' medical insurance and from the third-party tortfeasor, USARCS policy is not to collect twice. RJAs will carefully coordinate with the MTF to insure that double collection does not occur. Demand for lost pay should be enforced as it is not recoverable from medical care insurance.</P>

              <P>(2) The head of an ACO should request Chief, Litigation Division, OTJAG to have the RJA appointed as a Special Assistant United States Attorney when the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(i) Filing suit is a frequent necessity, e.g., insurance companies are refusing payment on small claims either by raising issues well settled or by regularly reducing the amount of medical care as not fair and reasonable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The local U.S. Attorney's office is in favor of such appointment due to his previous experience with the RJA and the additional burden of affirmative claims litigation on his staff;</P>
              <P>(iii) The RJA has at least two years experience and is likely to continue in the RJA assignment for at least one year; and</P>

              <P>(iv) Commander USARCS concurs in the appointment and is willing to furnish support.<PRTPAGE P="228"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The RJA may request that the attorney representing the injured party include the amount asserted by the United States as part of special damages. The injured party's attorney may not represent the United States nor may the United States pay attorney fees as this would be in violation of 5 U.S.C. 3106. Where indicated, this arrangement should be reduced to writing. Be mindful that the attorney's duty to the injured party is in conflict with the interests of the United States where the amount potentially recoverable is small in comparison to the amount asserted by the United States. In this event the RJA should pursue recovery independently.</P>
              <P>(b) Careful monitoring of all assertions is required to insure timely follow-up resulting in collection or suit where indicated. Installation of a suspense system to avoid the expiration of the statute of limitations is essential. Recommendations to file suit should be forwarded by the RJA well prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Within six months prior to the running of the statute of limitations, USARCS must be notified of the status of the claim or potential claim. Follow-up demands should precede filing suit to create a written record of efforts to avoid suit. Personal contact with all parties is encouraged. When represented, contact the representative.</P>
              <P>(c) Sources other than vehicle liability coverage should be exhausted in cases where the amount of the potential recovery exceeds $50,000 and the coverage is small. Coordination with USARCS is required. USARCS can obtain expert witnesses for medical malpractice cases, product liability cases, or other cases in which another tortfeasor may be involved.</P>

              <P>(a) If a tortfeasor or insurer refuses to settle, or if an injured party's attorney improperly withholds funds, the RJA or recovery attorney must consider litigation to protect the interests of the United States. Litigation is particularly appropriate if a particular insurer consistently refuses to settle claims, or if the government's interests are not adequately represented on a claim over $25,000.</P>
              <P>(b) RJAs or recovery attorneys must maintain close contact with local U.S. Attorney's Offices to ensure these offices are willing to initiate litigation on cases.</P>
              <P>(c) In order to directly initiate or intervene in litigation, an RJA or recovery attorney must prepare a litigation report and formally refer the case through the Affirmative Claims Branch, USARCS, and the Litigation Division, OTJAG (as required by AR 27-40, chapter 5), to the U.S. Attorney. While the RJA or recovery attorney, in conjunction with the Litigation Division Torts Branch, should attempt to have the U.S. Attorney's Office initiate litigation at least six months before the expiration of the statute of limitations (SOL), the RJA or recovery attorney may contact USARCS telephonically if SOL problems necessitate quick action on a case. The RJA or recovery attorney should also contact USARCS if a U.S. Attorney is reluctant to pursue an important case. An injured party's attorney may represent the government's interest in litigation without any special coordination.</P>

              <P>(5) The statute of limitations has run and the debtor refuses to pay.</P>
              <P>(6) Collection of all or part of the amount of funds demanded would create inequity. The following criteria apply:</P>
              <P>(i) Detailed information on what funds are available for recovery.</P>
              <P>(ii) Reasonable value of the injured party's claim for permanent injury, pain and suffering, decreased earning power, and any other special damages.</P>
              <P>(iii) Military, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security disability, and any other government benefits accruing to the injured party.</P>
              <P>(iv) Probability and amount of future medical expenses of the government and the injured party.</P>
              <P>(v) Present and prospective assets, income, and obligations of the injured party and those dependent on him or her.</P>
              <P>(vi) The financial condition of the debtor.</P>

              <P>(ix) The willingness of the tortfeasor to enter into an installment agreement.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Releases.</E> The RJA or recovery attorney may execute a release for affirmative claims in the pre-litigation stage acknowledging that the government has received payment in full of the amount asserted or the compromised amount agreed upon, or the final installment payment. The format of the release should be similar to the sample posted at the USARCS Web site (for the address see the Note to § 537.1). However, the RJA or recovery attorney may not execute either an indemnity agreement or a release which prejudices the government's right to recover on other claims arising out of the same incident without the approval of USARCS. In addition, the RJA or recovery attorney may not execute a release that purports to release any claim that the injured party may have other than for medical care furnished or to be furnished by the United States. The RJA or recovery attorney will not execute a release if the government's claim is waived or terminated.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Enforcement of assertions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Meritorious assertions that do not result in collections should be enforced as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) Where the debtor is a business or corporation otherwise financially capable the RJA or equivalent should forward a recommendation to bring suit or intervene in an existing suit regardless of the amount of the debt. As authorized by 28 U.S.C. 3011, the demand amount in the complaint shall include an additional 10% of the original claimed amount, to cover the administrative costs of processing and handling the enforcement of the debt.<PRTPAGE P="230"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Where the debtor is an individual rather than a business, an asset determination should be made both as to existing assets or prospective earnings. If the injured party's attorney has made an assets search which is reliable, review the search before requesting a new one. Such a search can be paid for out of existing collections.</P>
              <P>(1) If the debtor has assets refer to USARCS for transfer to a debt collection contractor or an agency debt collection center as determined by USARCS.</P>
              <P>(2) If the debtor has no assets, but prospective future earnings, RJA may seek a confession of judgment and maintain contact with the debtor for future collection where authorized by state law and filing of suit is not required. If the amount is less then $5,000, enter into an installment payment arrangement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Depositing of collections.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Depositing property damage recovery</E>—(1) <E T="03">Machines, supplies, watercraft, aircraft, vehicles other than General Services Administration-owned.</E> Recovered money must be deposited into the General Treasury Account 21R3019. This account remains the same every fiscal year. It was established in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3302(b) and by Comptroller General decision B-205508, 64 Comp. Gen. 431.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Real property.</E> Collection for damage to real property must be deposited into an escrow account on behalf of the installation or activity at which the loss occurred. This escrow account must be set up at the request of the command claims service, ACO or CPO with the local finance office or resource management office with responsibility for department of engineering and housing or department of public works funds. The escrow account must be set up and managed by the department of engineering and housing or the department of public works to (1) temporarily hold deposits, and (2) to “roll over” deposits each fiscal year in order to avoid reversion of these deposits to the General Treasury at the end of each fiscal year. If the escrow account is not set up and managed in this manner it is operating in violation of 10 U.S.C. 2782.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">NAFI property.</E> The Risk Management Program (RIMP) often reimburses local NAFIs for property loss or damage to facilitate return of equipment to daily use. When money is recovered from tortfeasors and their insurance carriers contact the NAFI involved for instructions on the current procedures as to where the recovered money is to be forwarded and deposited.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Army Stock Fund or Defense Business Operations Fund property.</E> Monies recovered for damage to property belonging to one of these funds will be returned to that fund unless the fund has charged the cost of repair or replacement to an appropriated fund account. The Defense Business Operations Fund replaced the Army Industrial Fund.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Government housing in cases of abuse or neglect by soldiers or families.</E> Monies recovered for damage to government housing caused by a soldier's abuse or negligence (or by a soldier's family member or guest of the soldier) will be deposited into that installation's family housing operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) account.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Government housing in cases of negligence by nonresidents.</E> Government housing caused by the negligence of a nonresident must be asserted against the nonresident directly or through his/her insurer. Settlement checks must be deposited into the real property escrow account in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2782.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Depositing recovery of pay provided to a soldier while incapacitated.</E> Monies recovered for the costs of pay provided to a soldier injured by the tortious acts of another shall be credited to the local O&amp;M account that supports the command, activity, or other unit to which the soldier was assigned at the time of the injury.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Depositing medical care recovery</E>—(1) <E T="03">To a medical treatment facility account.</E> Continental U.S. (CONUS) and outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS) claims offices, and command claims services, will deposit money recovered from an automobile insurer for medical care provided, paid for by, in or through an MTF to the O&amp;M account of the Army, Navy, or Air Force MTF that provided the care. CONUS and OCONUS claims offices, and command <PRTPAGE P="231"/>claims services, will deposit money recovered from any payor, under any provision of law, for medical care provided or paid for by, in or through an MTF into the MTF's O&amp;M account.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposits when TRICARE paid directly for treatment.</E> The account in which to deposit affirmative claims recoveries when TRICARE has paid directly for the medical treatment is a Defense Health Program (DHP) account for reallocation to the services. This replaces the general treasury miscellaneous receipts account published in AR 37-100 (obsolete). Deposit to TRICARE using this new account for recoveries pending deposit, and recoveries for any claim settled on or after October 1, 2002. Retroactive claims depositing is not necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Apportionment of medical care recovery between accounts.</E> Claims offices will often have to apportion recovered money among different accounts.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Apportioning money between accounts.</E> If care was provided by an MTF and paid for by or through the MTF and/or directly by TRICARE and/or a unit account for military lost wages if any, and the amount recovered is less than the amount asserted, deposit a prorated amount of money into each TRICARE account.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Apportioning money between two or more medical treatment facility accounts.</E> If care was provided by two or more MTFs and the claims office recovers less than the amount asserted, the claims office should give each MTF a pro rata share of the money recovered. For example, if MTF one provided $2,000 worth of care and MTF two provided $1,000 worth of care, the claims office will deposit $800 of a $1,200 recovery to MTF one's account and the remaining $400 to MTF two's account. Similarly, if the claims office recovers an amount less than that asserted for medical care expenses and costs of pay provided, the claims office should give a pro rata share of the money recovered to both the MTF and the appropriation account that supports the injured soldier's unit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Fiscal integrity.</E> Field claims offices must reconcile the property damage and medical care recovery accounts with their servicing defense accounting office. Field claims offices must ensure that their deposits have been credited to the proper accounts and that these accounts have not been improperly charged. All accounts must be reconciled at the end of the fiscal year.</P>

              <P>The Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4803-4804) applies worldwide and includes claims that arise on high seas or within the territorial waters of a foreign country.</P>
              <P>(a) 10 U.S.C. 4803 provides for agency settlement or compromise of claims for damage to:</P>
              <P>(1) DA-accountable properties of a kind that are within the federal maritime jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(2) Property under the DA's jurisdiction or DA property damaged by a vessel or floating object.</P>
              <P>(b) 10 U.S.C. 4804 provides for the settlement or compromise of claims in any amount for salvage services (including contract salvage and towage) performed by the DA. Claims for salvage services are based upon labor cost, per diem rates for the use of salvage vessels and other equipment, and repair or replacement costs for materials and equipment damaged or lost during the salvage operation. The sum claimed is usually intended to compensate the United States for operational costs only, reserving, however, the government's right to assert a claim on a salvage bonus basis in accordance with commercial practice.</P>
              <P>(c) The United States has three years from the date a maritime claim accrues under this section to file suit against the responsible party or parties.</P>

A claim settled or compromised in a net amount exceeding $500,000 will be investigated and processed and, if approved by the Secretary of the Army or his or her designee, certified to Congress for final approval.</P>
              <P>(b) TJAG, TAJAG, the Commander USARCS, the Chief Counsel COE, or Division or District Counsel Offices may settle or compromise and receive payment on a claim by the United States under this part if the amount to be received does not exceed $100,000. These authorities may also terminate collection of claims for the convenience of the government in accordance with the standards specified by the DOJ.</P>
              <P>(c) An SJA or a chief of a command claims service and heads of ACOs may receive payment for the full amount of a claim not exceeding $100,000, or compromise any claim in which the amount to be recovered does not exceed $50,000 and the amount claimed does not exceed $100,000.</P>
              <P>(d) Any money collected under this authority shall be deposited into the U.S. General Treasury, except that money collected on civil works claims in favor of the United States pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 408 “shall be placed to the credit of the appropriation for the improvement of the harbor or waterway in which the damage occurred * * *” (33 U.S.C. 412; 33 U.S.C. 571).</P>

              <P>(a) It is essential that Army claims personnel demand payment, or notify the party involved of the Army's intention to make such demands, as soon as possible following receipt of information of damage to Army property where the party's legal liability to respond exists or might exist. Except as provided below pertaining to admiralty claims and claims for damage to civil works in favor of the United States pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 408, copies of the initial demand or written notice of intention to issue a demand letter, as well as copies of subsequent correspondence, will be provided promptly to the Commander USARCS, who will monitor the progress of such claims.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to limitation of settlement authority, demands for admiralty claims and civil works damages in favor of the United States pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 408 may be asserted, regardless of amount, by the Chief Counsel COE, or his designees in COE Division or District Counsel offices.</P>
              <P>(c) Where, in response to any demand, a respondent denies liability, fails to respond within a reasonable period, or offers a compromise settlement, the file will be promptly forwarded to the Commander USARCS, except in those cases in which a proposed compromise settlement is deemed acceptable and the claim is otherwise within the authority delegated in § 537.18 of this part.

                <SUBJECT>Administration.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section outlines the duties and prescribes the general authority and general responsibilities of an installation commander.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The regulations in this section are applicable to installations in the United States, and where appropriate, to oversea installations. Oversea commanders should consult with the appropriate judge advocate to determine to what extent the provisions of treaties or agreements, or the <PRTPAGE P="236"/>provisions of local law may make inapplicable, in whole, or in part, the provisions of these regulations.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">General.</E> The installation commander is responsible for the efficient and economical operation, administration, service, and supply of all individuals, units, and activities assigned to or under the jurisdiction of the installation unless specifically exempted by higher authority. Activities will be designated as “attached activities” only when specifically designated by higher authority. The installation commander will furnish base operation support to all Army tenant activities except when the Department of the Army has given approval for the tenant to perform base operation functions. Reimbursement for such support will be in accordance with applicable regulations.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Motor vehicle and traffic regulations.</E> See AR 190-5, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision; AR 190-5-1, Registration of Privately Owned Motor Vehicles; AR 190-29, Minor Offenses and Uniform Violation Notices—Referred to US District Courts; AR 210-4, Carpooling and Parking Controls; AR 230-14, Registration and Licensing of Nonappropriated Fund Owned Vehicles; AR 385-55, Prevention of Motor Vehicle Accidents; and AR 600-55, Motor Vehicle Driver-Selection, Testing, and Licensing. A copy of the above documents may be obtained by writing to Headquarters, Department of the Army (DAAG-PAP-W), Washington, DC 20314.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Firearms.</E> The installation commander will publish regulations on the registration of privately owned firearms. See AR 608-4, Control and Registration of War Trophies and War Trophy Firearms. A copy of the above document may be obtained by writing to Headquarters, Department of the Army (DAAG-PAP-W), Washington, DC 20314.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Entry, exit, and personal search.</E> The installation commander will establish rules that govern the entry into and exit from the installation and the search of persons and their possessions as listed in paragraphs (f) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) The installation commander may direct authorized guard personnel, while in the performance of assigned duty, to search persons (including military personnel, employees, and visitors), and their possessions (including vehicles) when entering, during their stay, or when leaving facilities for which the Army has responsibility. These searches are authorized when based on probable cause that an offense has been committed or on military necessity. Instructions of commanders regarding searches should be specific and complete. When the person to be searched is a commissioned officer, or a warrant officer, the search should be conducted in private by or under the supervision of a commissioned officer, unless such is precluded by the exigencies of the situation. When the person to be searched is a noncommissioned officer, the search should be conducted in private by or under the supervision of a person of at least equal grade, unless such is precluded by the exigencies of the situation. If the situation precludes search by or under the supervision of an officer (or noncommissioned officer, as appropriate), the person conducting the search will notify a responsible commissioned officer (or noncommissioned officer, as appropriate), as soon as possible. Persons who are entering the installation should not be searched over their objection, but they may be denied the right of entry if they refuse to consent to the search. All persons entering facilities should be advised in advance (by a prominently displayed sign, AR 420-70, (Buildings and Structures)), that they are liable to search when entering the installation, while within the confines of the installation, or when leaving (AR 190-22, Search, Seizure and Disposition of Property). A copy of the above documents may be obtained by writing to headquarters, Department of the Army (DAAG-PAP-W), Washington, DC 20314.</P>

                <P>(2) The installation commander may authorize and control hunting and fishing on a military installation under installation rules in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and Army regulations, and in harmony with cooperative plans with appropriate State and Federal conservation agencies (AR 420-74, Natural Resources—Land, Forest, and Wildlife Management). To detect violations of <PRTPAGE P="237"/>these rules, special guards may be posted and authorized to search persons (or possessions, including vehicles of individuals), based on military necessity. The installation commander may eject violators of game laws or post regulations and prohibit their reentry under 18 U.S.C. 1382. Violations of State laws which apply to military reservations according to the provisions of section 13, title 18, U.S.C. (Assimilative Crimes Acts), may be referred to the United States Magistrate in accordance with AR 190-29, Minor Offenses and Uniform Violation Notices—Referred to United States District Courts. Reports of violations of game laws will be reported to Federal or State authorities. An installation commander may not require membership in a voluntary sundry fund activity as a prerequisite to hunting and fishing on the installation. Accounting for the collection and spending of fees for hunting and fishing permits is outlined in chapter 12, AR 37-108, General Accounting and Reporting for Finance and Accounting Offices. A copy of the above documents may be obtained by writing to Headquarters, Department of the Army (DAAG-PAP-W), Washington, DC 20314.</P>
                <P>(3) When the installation commander considers that the circumstances warrant its use, DA Form 1818 (Individual Property Pass), will be used to authorize military and civilian personnel to carry Government or personal property onto an installation or to remove it from an installation.</P>
                <P>(4) Commanders will establish procedures to ensure than when blind persons are otherwise authorized to enter military facilities, their accompanying seeing-eye or guide dogs will not be denied entry. Such facilities include, but are not limited to: Cafeterias, snack bars, AAFES exchanges, retail food sales stores, medical treatment facilities, and recreational facilities. Seeing-eye or guide dogs will remain in guiding harness or on leash and under control of their blind masters at all times while in the facility. For purposes of safety and to prevent possible agitation of military police working dogs, seeing-eye or guide dogs will not be allowed in or around working dog kennels and facilities.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Official Personnel Register.</E> DA Form 647 (Personnel Register), is a source document that will be used at the lowest level of command having responsibility for strength accounting. The official register will be used for registering military personnel on arrival at or on departure from Army installations on permanent change of station, leave, or temporary duty. DA Form 647 may also be used for recording passes, visitors, etc. Registration of visists of less than 12 hours will be at the discretion of the commander except that registrations will be required when visits are at a place where United States troops are on duty in connection with a civil disorder.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Outside employment of DA Personnel.</E> See paragraph 2-6, AR 600-50 Standards of Conduct for Department of the Army Personnel. A copy of this document may be obtained by writing to Headquarters, Department of the Army (DAAG-PAP-W), Washington, DC 20314.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Preference to blind persons in operating vending stands.</E> As used in paragraphs (i) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, the term “vending stand” includes shelters, counters, shelving, display and wall cases, refrigerating apparatus, and other appropriate auxiliary equipment necessary for the vending of merchandise. The term “vending machine” means any coin-operated machine that automatically vends or delivers tangible personal property.</P>

                <P>(1) The installation commander will give preference to blind persons when granting permission to civilians to operate vending stands on installations where stands may be operated properly and satisfactorily by blind persons licensed by a State agency. Legal authority for such action is contained in the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act (20 U.S.C. 2-107 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Commanders will cooperate with the appropriate State licensing agency in selecting the type, location, or relocation of vending stands to be operated by licensed blind persons, except that preference may be denied or revoked if the commander determines that—</P>

                <P>(i) Existing security measures relative to location of the vending stand or to the clearance of the blind operator cannot be followed.<PRTPAGE P="238"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Vending stand standards relating to appearance, safety, sanitation, and efficient operation cannot be met.</P>
                <P>(iii) For any other reasons which would adversely affect the interests of the United States or would unduly inconvenience the Department of the Army. Issuance of such a permit will not be denied because of loss of revenue caused by granting a rent-free permit for operating a vending stand to a blind person. However, the permit will not be granted if in the opinion of the responsible commander such action would reduce revenue below the point necessary for maintaining an adequate morale and recreation program. The commander should consider the fact that funds derived from certain nonappropriated fund activities such as post exchanges, motion picture theaters, and post restaurants are used to supplement appropriated funds in conducting the morale and recreation program.</P>
                <P>(2) The preference established in paragraph (i)(1) of this section will be protected from the unfair or unreasonable competition of vending machines. No vending machine will be located within reasonable proximity of a vending stand that is operated by a licensed blind person if the vending machine vends articles of the same type sold at the stand, unless local needs require the placement of such a machine. If such is the case, the operation of, and income from the machine, will be assumed by the blind vending stand operator.</P>
                <P>(3) So far as is practicable, goods sold at vending stands that are operated by the blind will consist of newspapers, periodicals, confections, tobacco products, articles that are dispensed automatically or are in containers or wrappings in which they were placed before they were received by the vending stand, and other suitable articles that may be approved by the installation commander for each vending stand location.</P>
                <P>(4) If the commanders and State licensing agencies fail to reach an agreement on the granting of a permit for a vending stand, the revocation or modification of a permit, the suitability of the stand location, the assignment of vending machine proceeds, the methods of operation of the stand, or other terms of the permit (including articles which may be sold), the State licensing agency may appeal the disagreement, through channels, to the Secretary of the Army. Appeals will be filed by State licensing agencies with the installation commander who will conduct a complete investigation and will give the State licensing agency an opportunity to present information. The report of investigation with the appeal will be forwarded through channels to Headquarters, Department of the Army (DAPE-ZA), Washington, DC 20310, as soon as possible. A final decision by the Secretary of the Army will be rendered within 90 days of the filing of the appeal to the installation commander. Notification of the decision on the appeal and the action taken will be reported to the State licensing agency, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Department of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).</P>

                <P>(i) The presence and activities of the labor representatives will not interfere with the progress of the contract work involved; and</P>

                <P>(iv) Violate pertinent safety or security considerations.</P>
                <P>(3) The determination as to who is an appropriate labor representative should be made by the installation commander after consulting with his/her labor counselor or judge advocate. Nothing in this regulation, however, will be construed to prohibit private contractors' employees from distibuting organizational literature or authorization cards on installation property if such activity does not violate the conditions enumerated in paragraph (k)(2) of this section. Business offices or desk space for labor organizations on the installation is not authorized to be provided for solicitation of membership among contractors' employees, collection of dues, or other business of the labor organization not directly connected with the contract work. The providing of office or desk space for a contractor is authorized for routine functions by the working steward whose union duties are incidental to his/her assigned job and connected directly with the contract work.</P>
                <P>(4) Only the installation commander or a contracting officer can deny entry to a labor representative who seeks permission to enter the installation in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section. If a labor representative is denied entry for any reason, such denial will be reported to the Labor Advisor, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (IL&amp;FM), Washington, DC 20310. This report will include the reasons for denial, including—</P>
                <P>(5) The provisions of paragraphs (k), (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section on organizations representing private contractors' employees should be distinguished from activities involving organization and representation of Federal civilian employees.

When an employer who is operating on the installation or activity is responsible to an authority other than the installation or activity commander, the commander will direct that the authority's representative apprise the employer of his/her obligations regarding labor law. This applies to employers in all activities, including nonappropriated fund activities established as Federal instrumentalities according to AR 230-1, Nonappropriated Fund System, concessionaires of such activities, and other private employers.

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The regulations in §§ 552.30 to 552.39 set forth the authority, policy, responsibility, and procedure for the acquisition of real estate and interests therein, for use for military purposes by the Department of the Army.

It also includes piers, docks, warehouses, rights-of-way, and easements, whether temporary or permanent, and improvements permanently attached to and ordinarily considered real estate. It does not include machinery, equipment, or tools which have not been affixed to or which have been severed or removed from any such lands or buildings or may be so severed or removed without destroying the usefulness of the structures.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Installation.</E> An installation is real estate and the improvements thereon which is under the control of the Department of the Army, at which functions of the Department of the Army are carried on, and which has been established by order of the Department of the Army. Real estate and the improvements thereon utilized by posts, camps, airfields, hospitals, depots, arsenals, industrial facilities, cemeteries, etc., generally will be designated as an installation where located separately, but where located contiguously or on the same reservation the combined property will usually be designated as one installation and the separate functions will be designated as activities at that installation. As used in the regulations in §§ 552.30 to 552.39, the term “installation” will include installations, subinstallations, and separate locations housing an activity.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Subinstallation.</E> A subinstallation is real estate and the improvements thereon which is under the control of the Department of the Army, at which functions of the Department of the Army are carried on, and which has been assigned as a subinstallation by Department of the Army authority. Subinstallations are attached to installations for command and administrative purposes, although they are located separately.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Activity.</E> An activity is a function or a group of related functions which may be carried on at an installation, a subinstallation, or a separate location which has not been designated as a Department of the Army installation or subinstallation.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Command installation.</E> A command installation is any installation of the Department of the Army, including nonmanufacturing arsenals, primarily used or useful for activities of the Army other than for the production of materiel, munitions, or supplies.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Industrial installation.</E> Any unit of real property under control of the Department of the Army (including structures on land owned by or leased to the United States, substantially equipped with production utilities and maintenance machinery, tools, equipment, and including housing and other supporting facilities built as an integral part of the installation) designed for the production of equipment, supplies, or materials for military use; or for the processing, production, or manufacturing of components of such items.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Lease.</E> A lease is a conveyance of an interest in real estate for a term of years, revocable at will, or as otherwise provided in the instrument in consideration of a return of rent.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">License.</E> A license is a bare authority to do a specified act or acts <PRTPAGE P="242"/>upon the land of the licensor without possessing or acquiring any estate therein.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Easement.</E> An easement is a conveyance of an interest in real estate for the purpose or purposes specified in the grant.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Authority to acquire real estate and interests therein.</SUBJECT>
                <P>While the Federal Government has the inherent power to acquire land for its constitutional purposes, this power can be exercised only at the discretion of Congress (Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151; 29 L. Ed. 845; 6 S. Ct. 670). No land shall be purchased on account of the United States, except under a law authorizing such purchase (R. S. 3736; 41 U.S.C. 14). No real estate not in Federal ownership shall be acquired by a military department, except as such acquisition is or shall be expressly authorized by law (section 501(b), Act July 27, 1954; Pub. L. 534, 83d Congress; 68 Stat. 560).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Estates and methods of acquisition.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Title to non-Government-owned real estate will be by purchase, condemnation, donation (when the authorization act specifies donation), and exchange (when the authorization act specifies exchange).</P>
                <P>(b) Easements in non-Government-owned real estate are the same as in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) Licenses in non-Government-owned real estate are generally by donation, although a nonrevocable license might be acquired by purchase.</P>
                <P>(d) Leaseholds in non-Government-owned real estate will be by negotiation or condemnation. Leaseholds may give the Government exclusive use or may give the Government co-use with the owner for specific purposes.</P>
                <P>(e) Jurisdiction over Government-owned real estate will be by transfer, reassignment, withdrawal, and reservation.</P>
                <P>(f) Permits to use Government-owned real estate will be by instrument issued by another Government department or agency. Although in the nature of a license (may be revocable or nonrevocable), the instrument is designated as a “permit”, since it relates to Government-owned real estate, to distinguish it from a “license” relating to non-Government-owned real estate.</P>
                <P>(g) Recapture of use of former Government-owned real estate which was disposed of subject to a “National Security Clause,” a “National Emergency Clause,” or a similar provision will be by letter from the Chief of Engineers to the owner of the property, based upon a directive from the Secretary of the Army or his designee.</P>
                <P>(h) Revestment of title to former Government-owned real estate which was disposed of subject to a reverter provision, such as a “National Defense Purpose Clause” will be by letter to the owner by the official of the department designated in the conveyance by the Government.</P>
                <P>(i) Procurement of options on real estate which is “suitable and likely to be required” in connection with a military public works project, prior to express authorization by law for the acquisition of said real estate will be by negotiation.</P>
                <P>(j) Extinguishment of third party interests in lands owned or controlled by the United States, such as outstanding oil, gas, and other mineral rights; grazing rights; timber rights; water rights; and easements for rights-of-way for highways, railroads, power lines, communication lines, water lines, and sewer lines will be the same as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. Payment for extinguishment of grazing rights or licenses on public domain or other property owned by or under the control of the United States is made pursuant to Act July 9, 1942; 56 Stat. 654; as amended by Act May 28, 1948; 62 Stat. 277; and as further amended by Act October 29, 1949; 63 Stat. 996 (43 U.S.C. 315q and r).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Present holdings inadequate for essential mission.</E> No request to acquire real estate by transfer from Navy or Air Force or from another Government agency, or by purchase, lease or condemnation will be considered or approved unless it is established that:</P>

                <P>(1) The activity to be accommodated is essential to an assigned mission.<PRTPAGE P="243"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Real property under the control of the Army is inadequate to satisfy these requirements.</P>
                <P>(3) No real property under the control of the Navy or Air Force or other Federal agencies is suitable and available for use by the Army on a permit or joint use basis.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Order of priority for method of acquisition.</E> If the activity qualifies as essential to an assigned mission but the need cannot be filled by the use of other Army property or other Federal property on a permit or joint use basis, the following alternatives will be considered in the order listed:</P>
                <P>(1) Donation or long-term nominal rental lease.</P>
                <P>(2) Transfer from Navy or Air Force. Acquisition of lands excess to the requirements of other military departments.</P>
                <P>(3) Recapture of use.</P>
                <P>(4) Public Domain. Withdrawal from the public domain for military use. (Pub. L. 85-337, Feb. 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 28) requires that an Act of Congress be obtained to withdraw, reserve, or restrict for defense purposes more than 5,000 acres of the public domain.)</P>
                <P>(5) Acquisition by exchange. Exercise of existing authorities for the exchange of Government-owned real property for non-Government-owned real property that is by type or location adaptable to the military need.</P>
                <P>(6) Transfer from other Federal agencies. Acquisition of lands excess to the requirement of Federal agencies other than military departments.</P>
                <P>(7) Acquisition by purchase, lease or condemnation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Current requirements given preference.</E> In considering the use of Army real property by another military department, current requirements will, in the absence of unusual circumstances, be given preference over future needs and mobilization requirements. If the current requirement will not continue through mobilization, care must be exercised to avoid modification of the property in a manner that would prevent its timely return to the holding department to meet the mobilization requirement. If it is contemplated that the current requirement will continue through mobilization, the property may be modified as required and the mobilization plans of the military departments concerned should be changed accordingly.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Firm requirements and minimum acquisition.</E> Requirements in each individual case will be firmly determined and only the minimum amount of property necessary will be acquired.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Factors considered insufficient justification for acquisition by lease.</E> Desirability of location in an urban area, reduced travel time for employees or business representatives, nominal savings in transportation costs, environmental considerations (such as noise or traffic), or desirability of single unit offices instead of split locations in close proximity will not be considered sufficient justification for acquiring leased space or facilities when Government-owned property is available. For exceptions, see paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Special location considerations.</E> Acquisition of title or a leasehold interest in real property may be justified where it is demonstrated that the function to be accommodated is an essential activity and the geographic location thereof in other than Government-owned space is vital to the accomplishment of the assigned mission. Examples that may fall in this group are recruiting stations (exclusive of kindred examining and induction units), airbases, air defense sites, and sites for construction of facilities for Reserve Components of the Armed Forces.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Army Reserve training sites.</E> In general, title to lands will not be acquired for exclusive use as training sites. Training sites will be acquired by one of the following means in the order listed:</P>
                <P>(1) Use of lands under the control of the Department of the Army regardless of the agency maintaining jurisdiction, to include class II and industrial installations and other Reserve Component facilities, see title 10 U.S.C. 2331 and 2237.</P>

                <P>(2) Use of reservoir lands of Civil Works Projects. By informal agreement with the Resident Engineer or Manager (when training activities do not involve exclusive use, construction, or destruction of vegetation) or by permit from the District Engineer (for other activities when such activities <PRTPAGE P="244"/>are compatible with the operation and maintenance of the project and will not endanger the use by the general public of public access areas).</P>
                <P>(3) Use of lands, by permit or otherwise, under the control of the other military departments.</P>
                <P>(4) Use of lands by permit of other Government-owned land, including the public domain.</P>
                <P>(5) Use by license or nominal rental lease of local, county, or State-owned public lands.</P>
                <P>(6) Use of privately owned land by short-term co-use lease under the authority granted in § 552.39.</P>
                <P>(7) Use of non-Government-owned land by lease.</P>
                <P>(8) Acquisition of lands excess to the requirements of the other military departments.</P>
                <P>(9) Acquisition of lands excess to the requirements of Federal agencies other than the military departments.</P>
                <P>(10) Acquisition of the non-Government-owned land.</P>
                <P>(11) As a rule of thumb, lands will not be acquired for training from any source when the value of the land exceeds that of rural farm land in the area.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Public notice and release of information relative to proposed real estate acquisitions.</E> It is the policy of the Department of the Army to give notice to the public and to release information to the public as early as possible (at the site selection stage) and as completely as possible, consistent with existing regulations. Even though opposition may develop in some cases because of early release of information as to proposed acquisitions, application of this policy should more often result in favorable public relations, general public support of proposed acquisitions, and material assistance in the selection of sites which will fulfill the military requirement and still have the least impact on the civilian economy. This policy will permit consideration of public preferences in the establishment of military facilities. Section 302 of the Act of July 14, 1960; Pub. L. 86-645, which is applicable to military as well as water resources public works projects, provides for dissemination of information on large new installations.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Restrictions relating to Agency Budget Estimates and Presidential Budget Recommendations.</E> Bureau of the Budget Circular No. A-10, as revised, places restrictions on disclosure of Agency Budget Estimates and Presidential Budget Recommendations. It provides that budget recommendations and estimates are administratively confidential until made public through formal transmittal of the budget to Congress. Public notice and release of information relative to proposed real property acquisitions will, therefore, exclude any information as to whether the proposed acquisition has been included in a pending budget not yet formally transmitted to the Congress or is to be included in a future budget. Public notice and release of information will be on the basis of “advance planning.”</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">General application and exceptions.</E> Non-Government-owned real property generally is acquired by negotiations, based on its fair market value as established by Government appraisal and regardless of who the owner is, how much the owner paid for the property, and how long the owner has owned the property. For this reason, public notice and release of information should not tend normally to increase the value of the land involved or create speculation therein. Experience has proved that interest of the Government in specific real property normally tends to discourage trafficking therein. Though normally the release of information should not result in subsequent disadvantage to the Government, information will not be released in any specific case where it might have that result. AR 345-15 applies to the acquisition of real property only in those instances in which the release of advance information on proposed plans might provide undue discriminatory advantage to private or personal interests.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Application to Army Reserve facilities.</E> During the preliminary site selection stage for Army Reserve facilities, the Army commander's representative will contact responsible local public officials to explain the nature of the proposed facility and to obtain their concurrence in the Army's acquisition and use of the site tentatively selected. Such a statement, including the names and titles of officials contacted, will be <PRTPAGE P="245"/>furnished by the Army commander to the District Engineer for inclusion in the Real Estate Planning Report. Release of information on Army Reserve centers will be made only by an authorized representative of the Army commander.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Use of unappropriated and nonnavigable water.</E> It is the policy of the Department of the Army to utilize unappropriated and nonnavigable water upon or under lands under jurisdiction in such a manner as is consonant with the purposes of water laws which have been enacted by the several States.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Permanent construction.</E> If permanent construction, defined as that which produces a building suitable and appropriate to serve a specific purpose for a maximum period of time (at least 25 years) and with a minimum of maintenance, is to be constructed by the Government, the Government must either hold or acquire title to the land (inclusive of all mineral rights and improvements) or a permanent easement interest, with the following exceptions:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Right of reuse by exercise of National Security Clause.</E> Property, including land or buildings, over which the Government currently holds the right of reuse by exercise of the National Security Clause.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Right of reuse by exercise of National Emergency Use Provision.</E> Property, including land or buildings, over which the Government holds the right of reuse by exercise of a National Emergency Use Provision. Inasmuch as such rights inure to the Government only during the period or periods of national emergency as may be declared by the President or the Congress and are extinguished by the termination thereof, every effort will be made to negotiate a lease covering such property under terms that would provide for the right of continuous possession by the Government for a minimum of 25 years.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Rights-of-way.</E> Property required as a site for installation of utility lines and necessary appurtenances thereto, provided a long-term easement or lease can be secured at a consideration of $1 per term or per annum.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Airbase.</E> Property required for airbases, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions for:</P>
                <P>(i) Right of continuous use by the Government under firm term or right of renewal, for a minimum of 50 years.</P>
                <P>(ii) A rental consideration of $1 per term or per annum.</P>
                <P>(iii) Reserving to the Government title to all improvements to be placed on the land and the right to dispose of such improvements by sale or abandonment.</P>
                <P>(iv) Waiver by the lessor of any and all claims for restoration of the leased premises.</P>
                <P>(v) Use of the property for “Government purposes” rather than for a specific purpose.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Reserve Components facilities.</E> Property required for facilities for the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions detailed in paragraphs (j)(4) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. When possible the insertion in a lease of provision restricting the use of the land to a specific purpose will be avoided; use of a term as “Government purposes” should be employed whenever possible.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Air defense sites.</E> Property required for air defense sites provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions detailed in paragraphs (j)(4) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this section and in addition thereto a right of continuous use by the Government under a firm term or right of renewal for as long as required for defense purposes.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Exception by Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and Logistics).</E> Where leases (for airbases, facilities for Reserve Components of the Armed Forces, or air defense sites) can be obtained containing some but not all of the above-listed provisions or where leases (for all other types of installations upon which permanent construction is to be placed by the Government) can be obtained containing similar provisions and it is considered to be to the best interest of the Government to acquire a lesser interest than fee title, it will be necessary to obtain approval from the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and Logistics) prior to placing permanent construction thereon.<PRTPAGE P="246"/>
                </P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Construction projects not in excess of $25,000.</E> Construction projects estimated to cost not in excess of $25,000 will not be considered as permanent construction for purposes of applying the above policy.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Industrial installations.</E> See paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">No permanent construction.</E> Where temporary construction or no construction is to be placed by the Government, acquisition of a lesser interest (leasehold, easement, license, as appropriate) will generally be considered to be in the best interest of the Government, with the following exceptions:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Cost of construction.</E> Where any proposed temporary construction to be placed by the Government has an estimated cost equal to or in excess of the current market value of the property.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Rent plus restoration.</E> Where the calculated period of required use is of sufficient duration that the sum expended for rentals over this period plus restoration, if required, would exceed 50 percent of the current market value of the property. (Apply calculated period of required use or 20 years, whichever is less.)</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Easement costing 75 percent of fee value.</E> Where the cost of acquiring an easement right exceeds 75 percent of the current fair market value of the property.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Industrial installations</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> Industrial facilities as used herein are defined as plants, buildings, utilities, improvements, and additions and appurtenances thereto used for military production and related purposes, including testing and development. Nonseverable industrial facilities as used herein are defined as industrial facilities located on other than Government-owned land, and which, after erection or installation, cannot be removed without substantial loss of value or damage thereto, or to the premises where installed.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Policy.</E> Industrial facilities will be located on land owned by the Government or in which the Government has a permanent, disposable interest. Nonseverable industrial facilities will be located on land in which the Government has a disposable interest equal in term to the estimated useful life of the facilities, unless the Head of a Procuring Activity, with consideration to any nonrecoverable costs involved, determines that such location is not feasible. If the Head of a Procuring Activity makes this determination, he may authorize the location of such facilities on other land, provided:</P>
                <P>(i) The estimated useful life of the facilities will not extend beyond the contract under which the facilities are installed or the completion of the work for which the facilities are provided; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The contractor agrees to purchase the facilities upon the end of the facilities contract at the acquisition cost of the facilities, less depreciation; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The Secretary approves other provisions as being in the interest of national defense.</P>
                <P>(iv) If location on land in which the Government does not have a disposable interest, as above set out, is authorized under paragraphs (l)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the Government must have the right to abandon the facilities in place, with no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the facilities or the premises on which they are located.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Commercial and industrial type facilities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Policy.</E> Privately owned or Government-owned and privately operated commercial and industrial type facilities will be used to the greatest extent practicable, recognizing the basic military necessity for integrated, self-sustaining units responsible to command and the necessity for operating anywhere in the world. It is the policy of the Department of the Army not to engage in the operation of industrial or commercial type facilities unless it can be demonstrated that it is necessary for the Government itself to perform the required work or service.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Commercial and industrial type facilities are defined as those devoted to an activity which normally might be performed by private industry (except commissaries, post exchanges, and nonappropriated fund activities) including, but not limited to, warehouses, motor repair shops, bakeries, laundries, and drycleaning facilities.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Department of Defense policy relative to liaison with Governor of Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</E> By letter dated August 19, 1953, the Secretary of Defense informed the Governor of the <PRTPAGE P="247"/>Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that the Department of Defense would establish liaison with the Governor to coordinate all military requirements for land acquisition in Puerto Rico. By memorandum dated August 19, 1953, the Secretary of Defense instructed that such liaison would be established under the direction of the Department of the Army, in coordination with the other interested services. On September 8, 1953, the Department of the Army requested the Commander in Chief, Caribbean Command, to establish such liaison. Liaison is being maintained locally between the Commandant of the Caribbean Sea Frontier and the Chairman of the Puerto Rico Planning Board. The liaison applies to the proposed acquisition of title or any interest in land which is other than (Federal) Government-owned land. In all cases, liaison action will be initiated during the advance planning or site selection stages. The purpose is to give Puerto Rican officials advance notice of military real property requirements and to give them an opportunity to suggest suitable alternatives in an effort to improve public relations with Puerto Rican officials, landowners, and the general public.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Rights-of-entry for survey and exploration.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary.</E> Where it is necessary to enter upon non-Government-owned real estate during site selection, particularly for the purpose of conducting topographic surveys and test borings, the appropriate division or district engineer will negotiate rights-of-entry for survey and exploration. The instrument is in the nature of a license which does not convey an interest in land but precludes the entry from being a trespass. Since the entry is for a limited purpose and for a relatively short period of time, the landowner is not offered rental for the privileges requested. Where the landowner insists upon payment for the privileges requested, district engineers are authorized to negotiate short-term co-use leases, within the limits of existing regulations.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Involuntary.</E> Where rights-of-entry for survey and exploration or short-term co-use leases cannot be negotiated, the right-of-entry may be obtained through the institution of proceedings for the condemnation of a short-term co-use leasehold interest. This action is taken only where it can be shown that the entry is imperative and that it is impossible to negotiate a voluntary right-of-entry or short-term co-use lease.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">When authorized.</E> Rights-of-entry for construction will be obtained by the district engineer only after a real estate directive or authorization to lease has been issued and then only when the construction schedule does not allow sufficient time to complete negotiations for an option to purchase or for a lease, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Involuntary.</E> Where a right-of-entry for construction cannot be negotiated, under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a right-of-entry will be obtained through the institution of proceedings for the condemnation of fee title, an easement interest, or a leasehold interest, as appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Acquisition by Chief of Engineers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory authority.</E> The Chief of Engineers, under the direction of the Secretary of the Army, is charged with the acquisition of all real estate for the use of the Department of the Army (10 U.S.C. 3038).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of responsibility.</E> This authority is exercised by the Chief of Engineers, acting for the Secretary of the Army, in the acquisition of all real estate and interests therein for the use of the Department of the Army in continental United States, Territories, possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Delegated authority.</E> The Chief of Engineers or his duly authorized representative has authority to approve, for the Secretary of the Army:</P>

                <P>(1) Fee, easement, and license acquisitions which do not exceed $5,000 for any one parcel and which constitute small tracts of additional land needed in connection with projects for which <PRTPAGE P="248"/>final Department of the Army, Department of Defense, and/or Congressional approval has been obtained, or which constitute rights-of-way for roads, railroads, and utility lines necessary to the construction, maintenance, and operation of an approved project.</P>
                <P>(2) Leasehold acquisition where the estimated annual rental for any single leasehold does not exceed $25,000 and the acquisition is not controversial, unusual, or inconsistent with Department of Army policies.</P>
                <P>(3) Renewal or extension of leaseholds.</P>
                <P>(4) Acquisition by permit of the right to use real property of another Government department or agency, except as to “general purpose” space from the General Services Administration and the Post Office Department and all space in the metropolitan District of Columbia area.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Minor boundary changes.</E> The Chief of Engineers, in accomplishing acquisition in accordance with Department of Defense and Department of the Army policies and with real estate directives and authorizations to lease issued by the Secretary of the Army or his designee, is authorized to make minor boundary changes to avoid severance damages, by including or excluding small tracts of land which will not decrease the usefulness of the area for the purpose for which it is being acquired.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Responsibility for all negotiations.</E> To avoid any possibility of misunderstanding by property owners and resultant embarrassment to the Department of the Army, under no circumstances will commitments be made either by negotiation or by dissemination of information to property owners, by any authority other than the Chief of Engineers. This is not intended to restrict the public notice and release of general information as set forth in § 552.34(h).</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Approval of title.</E> The written opinion of the Attorney General, in favor of the validity of the title, will be obtained for any site or land purchased by the United States. Unless expressly waived by the pertinent authorization act or other act of Congress, this opinion will be obtained prior to the expenditure of public money upon such site or land (section 355, as amended, of the Revised Statutes; 50 U.S.C. 175) except:</P>
                <P>(1) Easements acquired for military purposes. (By agreement with the Attorney General, his opinion is obtained only in acquiring easements at a cost in excess of $100.)</P>
                <P>(2) Leases and licenses.</P>
                <P>(3) Jurisdiction of Government-owned land by transfer or use of Government-owned land by permit.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Furnishing title evidence.</E> The Chief of Engineers, acting under the authority of the Secretary of the Army, will procure any evidence of title required by the Attorney General. The expense of procurement, except where otherwise authorized by law or provided by contract, may be paid out of the appropriations for the acquisition of land or out of the appropriations made for the contingencies of the Department of the Army (section 355, as amended, of the Revised Statutes; 50 U.S.C. 175).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Condemnation</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Fee title, easements, or leasehold interests may be acquired by the exercise of right of eminent domain through the institution of condemnation proceedings. These proceedings are instituted in the United States District Courts by the Attorney General, based upon requests from the Secretary of the Army. Normally, condemnation proceedings are instituted only after agreement cannot be reached with landowners or other parties in interest as to the value of the real property or interest therein to be acquired by the Government; where there are title defects which do not permit acquisition by purchase or lease, as appropriate; or where construction schedules or occupancy dates do not allow the Chief of Engineers sufficient time to conduct normal negotiations for options to purchase or lease.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Vesting of title or other interest in the United States.</E> Under a condemnation proceeding, title, or other interest condemned vests in the United States upon entry of final judgment in the proceeding. Where it is necessary to have title or other interest vested in the United States at an earlier date, a Declaration of Taking, signed by the Secretary of the Army, may be filed in the proceeding, with the petition or at <PRTPAGE P="249"/>any time before final judgment. Upon the filing of the Declaration of Taking and deposit in the court of the amount of estimated compensation, title or other interest condemned vests in the United States (Act of February 26, 1931; 46 Stat. 1421; 40 U.S.C. 258a).</P>

                <P>Commanders may issue regulations governing solicitation within their commands and on their installations. These regulations will avoid discriminatory requirements which could eliminate or restrict competition. When there is a clear need to prescribe more restrictive requirements for solicitation than those in this regulation or the regulations of the major commander, these additional requirements or restrictions must first be reviewed and confirmed by The Adjutant General Center (DAAG-PSI), or by the overseas commander.</P>

                <P>The installation commanders may permit solicitation and transaction of commercial business on military installations.

                <P>To maintain discipline; protect property; and safeguard the health, morale, and welfare of his personnel, the installation commander may impose reasonable restrictions on the character and conduct of commercial activities. Members of the Armed Forces must not be subjected to fraudulent, usurious, or unethical business practices. Reasonable and consistent standards must be applied to each company and its agents in their conduct of commercial transactions on the installation.</P>

                <P>To transact personal commercial business on military installations in the United States, its territories, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, individuals must present, on demand, to the installation commander, or his designee, documentary evidence that the company and its agents meet the licensing requirements of the State in which the installation is located. They <PRTPAGE P="251"/>must also meet any other applicable regulatory requirements imposed by civil authorities (Federal, State, county, or municipality). For ease of administration, the installation commander will issue a temporary permit to agents who meet these requirements.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Authorization to solicit.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Solicitation must be authorized by the installation commander. A specific appointment must be made with the individual and must be conducted in family quarters or in other areas designated by the installation commander. Before issuing a permit to solicit, the commander will require and review a statement of past employment. The commander will also determine, if practicable, whether the agent is employed by a reputable firm.</P>
                <P>(b) Certain companies seeking solicitation privileges on military installations may arrange personal demonstrations of their products at social gatherings and advise potential customers on their use. If these added services are provided, even though the merchandise sold by these companies is similar to that stocked by the post exchange, the installation commander may authorize solicitation privileges. Requests for this type of solicitation privilege will be coordinated with the local Army and Air Force Exchange Service representative. See paragraph 3-2, Army Regulation 60-10.</P>

                <P>(b) Particular caution must be taken when granting solicitation permission. The impression that permission is official indorsement or that the Department of the Army favors, sponsors, or recommends the companies, agents, or the policies offered for sale must not be conveyed. As continuing policy, the Department of the Army does not indorse any seller or product.</P>

                <P>(2) DOD personnel will not act in any official or business capacity, either directly or indirectly, as liaison with agents to arrange appointments.</P>
                <P>(3) Home address of members of the command or unit will not be given to commercial enterprises or individuals engaged in commercial solicitation, except when required by Army Regulation 340-17 and Army Regulation 340-21. The written consent of the individual must be obtained first.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Hours and location for solicitation.</E> (1) Military personnel and their dependents will be solicited individually, by specific appointment, and at hours designated by the installation commander or his designee. Appointments will not interfere with any military duty. Door-to-door solicitation without a prior appointment, including solicitation by personnel whose ultimate purpose is to obtain sales (e.g., soliciting future appointments), is prohibited. Solicitors may contact prospective clients initially by methods such as advertising, direct mail, and telephone.</P>
                <P>(2) Commanders will provide one or more appropriate locations on the installation where agents may interview prospective purchasers. If space and other factors dictate limiting the number of agents who may use designated interviewing areas, the installation commander may publish policy covering this matter.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Regulations to be read by solicitors.</E> A conspicuous notice of installation regulations will be posted in a form and a place easily accessible to all those conducting on-post commercial activities. Each agent authorized to solicit must read this notice and appropriate installation regulations. Copies will be made available on installations. <PRTPAGE P="252"/>When practicable, as determined by the installation commander, persons conducting on-base commercial activities will be furnished a copy of the applicable regulations. Each agent seeking a permit must acknowledge, in writing, that he has read the regulations, understands them, and further understands that any violation or noncompliance may result in suspension of the solicitation privilege for himself, his employer, or both.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Forbidden solicitation practices.</E> Installation commanders will prohibit the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Solicitation during enlistment or induction processing or during basic combat training, and within the first half of the one station unit training cycle.</P>
                <P>(2) Solicitation of “mass,” group, or “captive” audiences.</P>
                <P>(3) Making appointments with or soliciting of military personnel who are in an “on-duty” status.</P>
                <P>(4) Soliciting without an appointment in areas used for housing or processing transient personnel, or soliciting in barracks areas used as quarters.</P>
                <P>(5) Use of official identification cards by retired or Reserve members of the Armed Forces to gain access to military installations to solicit.</P>
                <P>(6) Offering of false, unfair, improper, or deceptive inducements to purchase or trade.</P>
                <P>(7) Offering rebates to promote transaction or to eliminate competition. (Credit union interest refunds to borrowers are not considered a prohibited rebate.)</P>
                <P>(8) Use of any manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent device, scheme, or artifice, including misleading advertising and sales literature.</P>
                <P>(9) Any oral or written representations which suggest or appear that the Department of the Army sponsors or endorses the company or its agents, or the goods, services, and commodities offered for sale.</P>
                <P>(10) Commercial solicitation by an active duty member of the Armed Forces of another member who is junior in rank or grade, at any time, on or off the military installation (Army Regulation 600-50).</P>
                <P>(11) Entry into any unauthorized or restricted area.</P>
                <P>(12) Assignment of desk space for interviews, except for specific prearranged appointments. During appointments, the agent must not display desk or other signs announcing the name of the company or product affiliation.</P>
                <P>(13) Use of the “Daily Bulletin” or any other notice, official, or unofficial, announcing the presence of an agent and his availability.</P>
                <P>(14) Distribution of literature other than to the person being interviewed.</P>
                <P>(15) Wearing of name tags that include the name of the company or product that the agent represents.</P>
                <P>(16) Offering of financial benefit or other valuable or desirable favors to military or civilian personnel to help or encourage sales transactions. This does not include advertising material for prospective purchasers (such as pens, pencils, wallets, and notebooks, normally with a value of $1 or less).</P>
                <P>(17) Use of any portion of installation facilities, to include quarters, as a showroom or store for the sale of goods or services, except as specifically authorized by regulations governing the operations of exchanges, commissaries, non-appropriated fund instrumentalities, and private organizations. This is not intended to preclude normal home enterprises, providing State and local laws are complied with.</P>
                <P>(18) Advertisements citing addresses or telephone numbers of commercial sales activities conducted on the installation.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Business reply system.</E> Agents who desire to use a business reply card system will include the information on the card which a military member can complete to indicate where and when the member can meet the agent to discuss the subject. The meeting place should be that established in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the meeting is to be on the installation. This procedure should assist in removing any impression that the agent or his company are approved by the Department of the Army. It should further prevent an undesirable situation (e.g., military personnel paged on a public address system or called by a <PRTPAGE P="253"/>unit runner to report to the orderly room).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Advertising rules and educational programs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Department of the Army expects that commercial enterprises soliciting military personnel through advertisements appearing in unofficial military publications will voluntarily observe the highest business ethics in describing both the goods, services, and commodities and the terms of the sale (such as guarantees and warranties). If not, the publisher of the military publication will request the advertiser to observe them. The advertising of credit will conform to the provisions of the Truth-in-Lending Act, as implemented by Regulation Z, published by the Federal Reserve Board (12 CFR part 226).</P>
                <P>(b) Commanders will provide appropriate information and educational programs to provide members of the Army with information pertaining to the conduct of their personal commercial affairs (e.g., the protections and remedies offered consumers under the Truth-in-Lending Act, insurance, Government benefits, savings, estate planning, and budgeting). The services or representatives of credit unions, banks, and nonprofit military associations approved by HQDA may be used for this purpose provided their programs are entirely educational. Under no circumstances will the services of commercial agents, including loan or finance companies and their associations, be used for this purpose. Educational materials prepared or used by outside organizations or experts in this field may be adapted or used with applicable permission, provided the material is entirely educational and does not contain applications or contract forms.</P>

                <SUBJECT>“Cooling off” period for door-to-door sales.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Federal Trade Commission Rule, 16 CFR part 429, p. 233, effective 7 June 1974, pertains to a cooling off period for door-to-door sales. The rule applies to any sale, lease, or rental of consumer goods or services with a purchase price of $25 or more, whether under single or multiple contracts, in which the seller or business representative personally solicits the sale, including those in response to or following an invitation by the buyer, and the buyer's agreement or offer to purchase is made at a place other than the place of business of the seller. The purpose of the law is to allow the consumer the right to cancel a transaction at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of the transaction. When any door-to-door sale or transaction takes place anywhere on or off the installation (other than the seller's place of business) the consumer must be provided with a full and complete receipt or copy of a contract pertaining to the sale at the time of its execution which shall include the “cancellation statements” as required by the FTC rule.</P>

                <P>The Department of the Army encourages the acquisition of a sound insurance program that is suitably underwritten to meet the varying needs of the individual and is within his financial means. Accordingly, insurance agents may conduct personal business on an installation, when feasible, with disinterested third-party counseling provided, interviewing hours set aside, and facilities supplied. However, the privilege of insurance solicitation on installations is conditioned on full compliance with this regulation and on the clear understanding that permission is not indorsement of the company or the policies offered for sale.</P>

                <P>(c) In addition to the forbidden practices, installation commanders will prohibit the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The use of a commercial insurance agent as a participant in any military-sponsored education or orientation program.</P>
                <P>(2) The designation or announcement of any agent as “Battalion Insurance Advisor,” “Unit Insurance Counselor,” “SGLI Conversion Consultant,” or similar quasi-official titles.</P>

                <P>(a) In the United States, its territories, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, agents may be authorized to solicit on an installation provided—</P>
                <P>(1) Both the company and its agents are licensed in the State in which the installation is located. “State” as it pertains to political jurisdictions includes the 50 States, territories, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>
                <P>(2) The application to solicit is made by an accredited company (§ 552.69).</P>
                <P>(b) On Army military installation in foreign areas.</P>
                <P>(1) An agent may solicit business on U.S. military installations in foreign areas if—</P>
                <P>(i) The company he represents has been accredited by DOD;</P>
                <P>(ii) His name is on the official list of accredited agents maintained by the applicable major command;</P>
                <P>(iii) His employer, the company, has obtained clearance for him from the appropriate overseas commanders; and</P>

                <P>(iv) The commanding officer of the military installation on which he desires to solicit has granted him permission.<PRTPAGE P="255"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) To be employed for overseas solicitation and designated as an accredited agent, agents must have at least 1 year of successful life insurance underwriting in the United States or its territories. Generally, this is within the 5 years preceding the date of application.</P>
                <P>(3) General agents and agents will represent only one accredited commercial insurance company. The overseas commander may waive this requirement if multiple representation can be proven to be in the best interest of DOD personnel.</P>
                <P>(4) An agent must possess a current State license. The overseas commander may waive this requirement on behalf of an accredited agent who has been continuously residing and successfully selling life insurance in foreign areas and forfeits his eligibility for a State license, through no fault of his own, due to the operation of State law or regulation governing domicile requirements, or requiring that the agent's company be licensed to do business in that State. The request for a waiver will contain the name of the State and jurisdiction, which would not renew the agent's license.</P>
                <P>(5) An agent, once accredited in an overseas area, may not change his affiliation from the staff of one general agent to another, unless the losing company certifies, in writing, that the release is without justifiable prejudice. Unified commanders will have final authority to determine justifiable prejudice.</P>

                <P>(f) The obligation may be paid in full at any time or through accelerated payments of any amount.

As an alternative, the “Rule of 78” may be applied, in which case its operation shall be explained in the contract.</P>
                <P>(g) No charge shall be made for an insurance premium or for finance charges for such premium unless satisfactory evidence of a policy, or insurance certificate where State insurance laws or regulations permit such certificates to be issued in lieu of a policy, reflecting such coverage has been delivered to the debtor within 30 days after the specified date of delivery of the item purchased or the signing of a cash loan agreement.</P>
                <P>(h) If the loan or contract agreement provides for payments in installments, each payment, other than the down payment, shall be in equal or substantially equal amounts, and installments shall be successive and of equal or substantially equal duration.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Access controls.</E> (1) Fort Lewis is a closed post. Access to the installation is limited to persons with prior approved permission to enter.</P>
                <P>(2) Public access into the Main Cantonment Area of Fort Lewis is controlled through a series of static security posts manned by sentries empowered to grant or deny access to persons and material. The “Main Cantonment Area” is that area of the Fort Lewis Military Reservation shown on the overprinted 1:50,000 Fort Lewis Special Map (DMA Stock No. V791SFTLEWIS) excluding those areas designated thereon as Impact Areas, lettered Close-In Training Areas, or numbered Training Areas. A full sized map is located at the Fort Lewis Area Access Office, Building T-6127. As defined, the Main Cantonment Area includes, but is not necessarily limited to, those areas of the installation containing Government housing areas, schools, medical facilities, troop billets, the installation command and control facilities, Gray Army Air Field, Madigan Army Medical Center, and certain recreational sites controlled by the Director of Personnel and Community Activities.</P>
                <P>(3) Entry of the general public into the Main Cantonment Area at any location other than through established manned access control points is strictly prohibited.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Trespassers.</E> Persons entering or remaining upon the Main Cantonment Area of the Fort Lewis Military Reservation in violation of this regulation are trespassing on a closed federal reservation and are subject to citation by the military police.

All such persons are trespassers for the purpose of this regulation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Prohibited Activities.</E> Department of Defense policy permits commanders to prohibit any expressive activity which could interfere with or prevent the orderly accomplishment of the installation's mission, or which presents a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline or morale of their soldiers. Therefore, unless the prior approval of the installation commander or his designated representative has been obtained, no person while on the Fort Lewis Military Reservation shall:</P>
                <P>(1) Engage in protests, public speeches, sit-ins, or demonstrations promoting a political point of view.</P>

                <P>(2) Engage in partisan political campaigning or electioneering.<PRTPAGE P="269"/>

                <P>(6) Utter to any person abusive, insulting, profane, indecent or otherwise provocative language that by its very utterance tends to incite an immediate breach of the peace.</P>
                <P>(7) Distribute or post publications, including pamphlets, newspapers, magazines, handbills, flyers, leaflets, and other printed material, except through regularly established and approved distribution outlets.</P>

                <P>(9) Disobey a proper request or order by Department of Defense (DoD) police, military police, or other competent authority to disperse or to leave the installation.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to comply.</E> Any person who enters or remains upon the Main Cantonment Area of Fort Lewis Military Reservation when he is not licensed, invited or otherwise authorized by the terms of this regulation or who enters or remains upon the Fort Lewis Military Reservation for a purpose of engaging in any activity prohibited by this regulation is in violation of the provisions of the regulation. Violators of this regulation may be subjected to administrative action or criminal punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), title 18 U.S.C. 1382, or title 50 U.S.C. 797, as appropriate to each individual's status.

              <P>(2) Sufficient circumstantial and anatomical evidence from the Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Accounting Command, which when combined with contemporary forensic or other scientific techniques, would lead to a high probability of individual identification of the interred group remains.</P>

              <P>(c) Placement of a private headstone or marker is conditional upon the primary next of kin agreeing in writing to maintain it in a manner acceptable to the Government. Should the headstone or marker become unserviceable at any time and the primary next of kin fail to repair or replace it, or if the marker is not updated to reflect all persons buried in that gravesite within 6 months of the most recent burial, the Executive Director reserves the right to remove and dispose of the headstone or marker and replace it with a standard, Government-furnished headstone or marker.</P>
              <P>(d) The construction of a headstone or marker to span two gravesites will be permitted only in those sections in which headstones and markers are presently spanning two gravesites and only with the express understanding that in the event both gravesites are not utilized for burials, the headstone or marker will be relocated to the center of the occupied gravesite, if possible.

              <P>The Deputy SECDEF, in his memorandum of 21 January 1972 to the Secretaries of the Military Departments, on the above subject, (enclosure 1), outlined broad policy considerations for the DoD Laboratory Consortium formed to coordinate non-defense work being performed by them for other government organizations. In order to establish more precise guidelines for the Consortium, an operating policy has been developed (enclosure 2) which establishes criteria for Consortium membership and the type of work that may be undertaken. Also, the following additional constraints are placed upon the operation of this Consortium;</P>
              <P>• The expenditure of in-house effort in any one laboratory shall be limited to 3% of the professional man-years at that laboratory unless expressed approval of the parent Military Department is granted to exceed this limit.</P>
              <P>• The DoD commitment to support the brokerage function at the National Science Foundation shall not exceed two man-years per year through FY 76, subject to the continued willingness of the Military Departments to absorb the costs.</P>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Subject: Non-Defense Work in DOD Laboratories and R&amp;D Facilities Civil government agencies are expressing an increased interest in the application of defense and aerospace technology to the solution of problems in the civil sector. Included in this interest is the desire to exploit the technological expertise which exists in our DOD laboratories for the solutions of domestic problems. Separate and distinct from work done for defense oriented agencies such as AEC and NASA, our DOD laboratories have, for may years, performed selected projects for other agencies upon request. Recently, fifteen of these laboratories have formed a consortium for the purpose of coordinating the non-defense work being performed by them for other government organizations. Although the level of effort is a very small percentage in these laboratories at the present time, the aggregate can have a substantial beneficial impact on domestic programs.</FP>

              <P>It is generally conceded that the most efficient transfer of technology occurs when the adaptation of a technology to a new purpose is carried out by the team which carried out the original development. Recognizing this, the <E T="03">Federal Council on Science and Technology (FCST) has approved a “Policy for Expanded Interagency Cooperation in Use of Federal Laboratories”</E> (attached). I endorse the spirit and intent of this policy.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">The Military Services are encouraged to participate in this endeavor consistent with mission and legislative constraints.</E> The level of effort in any laboratory is the prerogative of the cognizant Military Department which may, in turn, issue more detailed policy guidance as appropriate. Any Military Department policy shall be subject to the following considerations:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">The level of effort of the work undertaken shall be such that it does not impede the accomplishment of the missions of the Military Services and the defense laboratories.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The projects selected <E T="03">for non-defense work shall be compatible with the technological capability of the laboratory performing the work.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="313"/>
              </P>

              <P>(c) Projects may be undertaken in support of federal, state and local government organizations. <E T="03">Non-defense work will be performed for the private industrial sector only on an exception basis.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(d) The full costs of projects undertaken <E T="03">shall be supported by transfer of funds</E> through formal written agreements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Jointly sponsored projects are permitted when there is also a direct application to a Military requirement.</E> The commitment of funds and resources to joint programs shall be commensurate with the interest of each agency in the project.</P>
              <P>The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) shall explore with the Office of Management and Budget means for providing relief from any imposed manpower constraints to the extent of the DOD participation in non-defense work.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Operating Policy of the Department of Defense Technology Transfer Consortium</HD>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Purpose</E>—The purpose of this policy is to establish the basic framework and direction of the Department of Defense (DOD) Technology Transfer Consortium.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Background</E>—The DOD currently funds approximately half of the total Federal expenditure for R&amp;D. Civil government agencies are expressing an increased interest in the exploitation of defense technology for the solution of problems in the civil sector. The Military Departments have been encouraged to cooperate in this endeavor, subject to considerations promulgated by the Secretary of Defense.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Consortium Purpose</E>—The DOD Laboratories are a source of technology for the solution of these civil sector problems which are amenable to technological solutions. The primary role of the in-house laboratories is to provide a research and development base for the development of systems required to fulfill the national security mission of the DOD. However, these laboratories can serve a vital secondary role in the adaptation of technology to other fields and areas of need to the extent that it does not adversely impact on the primary DOD mission. A consortium of DOD Laboratories is formed for the purpose of coordinating interactions with other Federal Agencies and technology users at federal, state, and local level, and of coordinating the efforts in this endeavor. The technology transfer consortium is an association of DOD Laboratories working together through an informal affiliation. The main thrust of the consortium activity is through the individual and cooperative efforts of the laboratories involved, with an emphasis on the transfer and adaptation of technology through person-to-person mechanisms.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Criteria for Laboratory Consortium Membership.</E> The following criteria for the participation of a DOD Laboratory in Consortium activities shall apply:</P>
              <P>• The participation of any laboratory shall be undertaken with the full knowledge of the parent Military Department and the director or commander of the laboratory.</P>
              <P>• For each participating laboratory an individual shall be designated by name to represent that laboratory to the consortium, and to coordinate the technology transfer activities of that laboratory. Procedures should be adopted within each laboratory to preclude the dilution of the efforts of middle and top level management by their involvement in the administrative aspects of the technology transfer effort.</P>
              <P>• Any laboratory may withdraw from the Consortium by notifying the Consortium Chairman of this intent.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Criteria for Conduct of Work</E>—It is the view of the Consortium that the civil sector should rely on the private enterprise system to provide those services which are reasonably and expeditiously available through ordinary business channels. The laboratories shall attempt to provide a supplemental resource that is not technically available or that is obtainable only at an excessive cost. Such services shall not supplant existing private or industrial resources but are offered to enable other Federal agencies, State and local governments to avoid unnecessary duplication of special service functions.</P>
              <P>The following criteria shall apply for the conduct of work undertaken in the technology transfer program:</P>
              <P>• In order for work to be undertaken for any government organization each of the following criteria must be satisfied:</P>
              <P>a. Laboratory staff will not increase as a result of the additional work.</P>
              <P>b. Laboratory facilities will not be added for non-DOD work.</P>
              <P>c. Proposed work should relate to a laboratory's area of particular expertise and the laboratory should be a significant resource in the particular subject area.</P>
              <P>d. A determination should be made that the laboratory's background, experience and facilities are such that private industry could not perform the work except at a significantly increased cost.</P>
              <P>• The major emphasis of the Technology Transfer Consortium should be directed to:</P>
              <P>a. The transfer or adaptation of existing technology, either directly, or after being subjected to adaptive engineering.</P>
              <P>b. The preparation of documentation and technical assistance in those activities unique to the mission of the DOD laborabories.</P>

              <P>• Work will be performed for private industry only on an exception basis, such as when the laboratory possesses unique facilities that are required and which are not available in the private sector.<PRTPAGE P="314"/>
              </P>
              <P>• Description of the work to be accomplished and the funds to be transferred will normally be specified in a formal interagency agreement.</P>
              <P>• All costs shall be recovered from the receiving government organization, including realistic overhead costs, except that cooperative developments on a shared cost basis are encouraged where there is a distinct military application.</P>
              <P>• Laboratory production of hardware shall normally be limited to prototypes or test units required to prove feasibility.</P>
              <P>• Adaptive engineering shall not be performed on technological innovations for which a patent application has been made by a private industrial firm unless permission is received in writing from that firm. Technical, consulting, and support services will not normally be furnished another agency on a continuing basis.</P>
              <P>• Work in the form of analytic services shall not normally be undertaken in areas where comparable expertise exists in competitive industry. An exception to this provision is acceptable in areas of problem definition where existing Defense technology offers a unique potential solution.</P>

                <SUBJECT>For whom authorized.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In line of duty. Medical care is authorized for members who incur a disease or injury in line of duty under the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) When a disease is contracted or injury is incurred while enroute to, from, or during any type of training or duty under sections 503, 504, 505, and for Guardmembers on orders for over 30 days performing duty under section 502f of title 32, U.S.C. Such training includes, but is not limited to annual training, maneuvers and field exercises, service schools, small arms meets, and FTTD under aforementioned sections.</P>
                <P>(2) When an injury is incurred while engaged in any type of training under section 502 of title 32, U.S.C. Such training includes, but is not limited to, unit training assembly, multiple unit training assembly, and training in aerial flight, other than FTTD under 502f.</P>
                <P>(3) While not on duty and while voluntarily participating in aerial flights in Government-owned aircraft under proper authority and incident to training. Guardmembers are authorized medical and dental care required as the result of an injury incurred in line of duty.</P>
                <P>(4) Medical care is not authorized at Army expense for members who incur an injury while enroute to or from any type of training under section 502, except for Guardmembers ordered to perform duty for over 30 days under section 502f of title 32, U.S.C. Line of duty investigations and authorization for any medical treatment for conditions incurred while the members were performing Reserve Enlistment Program of 1963 (REP 63) training in a Federal status, or training under title 10, U.S.C. are the responsibility of the Army Area commander under whose jurisdiction the member was training, even though the individual may have returned to his/her National Guard status.</P>
                <P>(b) Not in line of duty. Members who incur an injury or contract a disease during any type of training or duty under sections 502f, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32, U.S.C., when it is determined to be not in line of duty, may be furnished medical care at Army expense during the period of training.</P>
                <P>(c) Armory drill status. Members who incur an injury while in an armory drill status under section 502 of title 32, U.S.C., when it is determined to be not in line of duty, may not be furnished medical care at Army expense.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Medical care benefits.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A member of the ARNG who incurs a disease or injury under the conditions enumerated herein is entitled to medical care, in a hospital or at his/her home, appropriate for the treatment of his/her disease or injury until the resulting disability cannot be materially improved by further medical care.</P>
                <P>(b) If it is determined that the disease or injury was directly related to authorized activities surrounding the care of the original disease or injury, medical care may be continued in the same manner as if it had occurred during the training period.</P>

                <P>(c) When members who incur a disease or an injury during a period of training or duty under title 32, U.S.C. 503, 504, 505, or 502f are admitted to an Army medical treatment facility, and it appears that a finding of “not in line of duty” may be appropriate, a formal line of duty investigation should be promptly conducted, and a copy of the report furnished the treatment facility. If these findings result in a “not in line of duty” determination prior to the date the training is terminated, every effort should be made to assist the hospital concerned in disposing of the patient from the hospital by the date the training is terminated or as soon thereafter as he/she becomes transportable. Medical care furnished such member <PRTPAGE P="317"/>after the termination of the period of training is not authorized at Army expense unless the “not in line of duty” determination is ultimately reversed. The individual may be furnished medical care at Army expense from the date the training is terminated to the date the member receives notification of this action. Medical care received subsequent to the member's receipt of such notification is not authorized at Army expense. In the event a line of duty investigation has not been made by the date the training is terminated, every effort will be made to arrive at a determination as soon thereafter as possible.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedures for obtaining medical care.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When a member of the ARNG incurs a disease or an injury, while performing training duty under sections 502-505 of title 32, U.S.C., he/she will, without delay, report the fact to his/her unit commander. Each member will be informed that it is his/her responsibility to comply with these instructions, and that failure to promptly report the occurrence of a disease or injury may result in the loss of medical benefits.</P>
                <P>(b) Authorization for care in civilian facility. (1) An individual who desires medical or dental care in civilian medical treatment facilities at Federal expense is not authorized such care without written or verbal authorization by the Chief, National Guard Bureau or his/her designee, except in an emergency.</P>
                <P>(2) When medical care is obtained without prior authorization, the details will be submitted to NGB-ARS as soon as practicable. The notification of medical care will be made following the format in the appendix. The notification will be reviewed by NGB-ARS and replied to as deemed appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Status while undergoing hospitalization. The ARNG status of an individual is not affected by virtue of his hospitalization. The provisions of AR 135-200 will apply. Determination of requirement for continued hospitalization will be made by the MTF commander. Paragraph (d) of this section will apply when a final “not in line of duty” determination has been made. Under no condition will an individual be assigned to the medical holding unit of a hospital.</P>
                <P>(d) Disposition of hospitalized cases. When it is determined that a hospitalized ARNG member has obtained the maximum benefits from hospitalization and there is no disability remaining from the condition for which hospitalized, he/she will be returned to his/her duty station or, if none, to his/her home of record at the time of entry into the hospital.</P>

                <P>(a) Limited authority for the payment of claims arising out of National Guard and Air National Guard activities has been granted annually for several years by provisions of the annual Appropriations Act for the Department of Defense. A recent provision is as follows:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>The following sums are appropriated, * * * For payment of * * *; claims (not to exceed $1,000 in any one case) for damages to or loss of private property incident to the operation of Army and Air National Guard camps of instruction, either during the stay of units of said organizations at such camps or while en route thereto or therefrom; * * * (Act of August 1, 1953, Public Law 179, 83d Cong.).</P>

                <P>(b) In accordance with general principles of law, the National Guard and the Air National Guard when not in Federal service are not agencies of the United States, and the United States is not liable for injury or damage arising from their activities. Thus, claims for such injury or damage are not cognizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act, as revised and codified (62 Stat. 982, 28 U.S.C. 3671-80). By the statutory provisions referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the United States assumes an obligation to settle administratively limited classes of claims relating to activities of the National Guard and the Air National Guard.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">While en route thereto or therefrom.</E> The period of time during which a unit as distinguished from its individual members if travelling from its rendezvous to a camp of instruction or return, or from the camp of instruction or on a regularly scheduled maneuver and return thereto, and the routes followed by the unit. The term does not include the movement of individuals.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Proximate cause.</E> No precise definition of this term can be given. Whether acts or omissions of personnel constitute proximate cause must be determined in accordance with the local law. In general, an act or omission may be said to have been a proximate cause of the accident or incident if it was one of the impelling forces resulting in the accident or incident. For example, in a rear-end collision, the failure of the driver of the following car to stop in time is said to be the proximate cause of the accident. But, if the driver of the leading car stopped so suddenly and without warning that the second car, using the utmost diligence, could not have stopped, the conduct of the driver of the leading car would be said to have been the proximate cause of the accident. An act or omission without the existence of which the accident or incident would not have occurred but which cannot be said to have brought it about is a condition and would not constitute a basis for liability, or, if committed by the claimant, would not constitute a basis for denial of his claim. For example, violations of statutes or ordinances providing standards of safety may be negligence in themselves, but may not constitute the bases of liability or for denial of a claim.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Scope of employment.</E> Scope of employment is determined in accordance with the law of the place where the accident or incident occurred, except that statutes in derogation of the common law, such as statutes creating a presumption that an employee is in <PRTPAGE P="320"/>scope of employment if using the employer's car with permission, are not controlling. An act or omission is within the scope of employment if such activity is expressly or impliedly directed or authorized by competent authority or is at least in part intended to further the mission of the unit or organization, or the interests of the National Guard or the Air National Guard. In determining whether an act or omission was within the scope of employment, consideration must be given to all the attendant facts and circumstances, including the time, place, and purpose thereof; whether it was in furtherance of the omission of the unit of the National Guard or Air National Guard; whether it was usual for or reasonably to be expected of personnel of the classification and grade involved; and whether the instrumentality causing the damage or injury resulted was property of the National Guard or Air National Guard, or of a State or the Federal Government being used by the National Guard or Air National Guard.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Action by claimant.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Who may present a claim.</E> A claim for damage to or loss of private property may be presented by the owner, or his agent or legal representative. The word “owner”, as so used, includes bailees, lessees, mortgagors, conditional vendors, and subrogees, but does not include mortgagees, conditional vendors, and others having title for purposes of security only. If filed by an agent or legal representative, the claim should be filed in the name of the owner, signed by such agent or legal representative, showing the title or capacity of the person signing, and be accompanied by evidence of the appointment of such person as agent, executor, administrator, guardian, or other fiduciary. If filed by a corporation the claim should show the title or capacity of the officer signing it and be accompanied by evidence of his authority to act. In case of the death of the proper claimant, if it appears that no legal representative has been or will be appointed, the claim may be presented by any person who, by reason of the family relationship, has in fact incurred the expense for which the claim is made.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of claim.</E> A claim shall be submitted in the form of a statement signed by the claimant, setting forth his address, and stating briefly all the facts and circumstances relating to the damage for which compensation is claimed, including a description of the property, evidence of its value, the nature and extent of the damage, the date and place such damage was incurred, the agency by which it was caused, if known, and the amount. Standard Form 95 (Claim for Damage or Injury), appropriately modified by deleting references to “injury” and “personal injury,” may be used for this purpose. The claim and all papers accompanying it which are signed by the claimant should bear like signatures.<PRTPAGE P="321"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Time within which claim must be presented.</E> A claim cognizable under §§ 564.51 to 564.58 must be submitted within two years of the date of occurrence of the accident or incident.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Place of filing.</E> A claim cognizable under §§ 564.51 to 564.58 must be presented in writing to the adjutant general, or his duly authorized representative, of the State, Territory, Commonwealth, or District of Columbia, having jurisdiction over the personnel or unit involved in the accident or incident out of which the claim arose, or to the office of the Chief, National Guard Bureau, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Evidence to be submitted by claimant</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A claim for damage to or loss of private property must be specific and substantiated by evidence of the damage or loss. A mere statement that such property was damaged or lost and that a certain amount is a fair compensation therefor is not sufficient to support a claim.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Motor vehicles, buildings, fences, and other structures.</E> The claimant must submit, if repairs or replacement has been effected, itemized bills therefor, signed and certified as just and correct by the repairman or suppliers, together with evidence of payment thereof, if made; if repairs or replacement has not been effected, an estimate of the cost thereof signed by a person competent to effect such repairs or replacement.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Crops, trees, land, and other realty.</E> The claimant must submit an itemized signed estimate of the cost of repairs or restoration of the property, supported by evidence of the number of acres of land, crops, or trees involved, the normal yield per acre and the market value of the property per unit of measure common to the property damaged, or the estimated length of time the land will be unfit for grazing, the normal rental value per acre of similar land in the vicinity, and such other information as may be necessary.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Contracts.</E> A copy of the contract, or competent evidence of the provisions thereof, will be furnished by the claimant in support of a claim cognizable under § 564.54.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional evidence.</E> The claims officer, the interested State adjutant general, or the Chief National Guard Bureau, may require the claimant to submit such additional evidences as he deems necessary to substantiate the claim, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, estimates of cost, of repairs from repairman other than those whose estimates the claimant has submitted with the claim and evidence of ownership of or interest in the property.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Responsibility for the investigation of claims cognizable under §§ 564.51 to 564.68 and of accidents or incidents which may give rise to such claims rests in the adjutants general of the several States. Accordingly, claims received by the National Guard Bureau, or other agencies of the United States, will be referred to the adjutants general of the interested States. Regulations promulgated by the State adjutants general should require the prompt investigation of all accidents or incidents which might result in claims cognizable hereunder, whether or not claims have been filed.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 564.58</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Determination of amount allowable.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The maximum amount which may be allowed is the value of the property immediately prior to the accident or incident. Subject to the foregoing, the amount allowable is the cost, incurred or estimated to be incurred, of replacing the property, or of restoring it to the condition in which it was immediately prior to the accident or incident. However, if as the result of the repairs effected, the value of the property is appreciably enhanced, a sum equal to the increase in value will be deducted from the cost of restoring the property in determining the amount allowed. Conversely, if after the repairs have been effected, the value of the property is appreciably less than that prior to the accident or incident, the difference in value will be added to the cost of repairs in determining the amount allowed. However, no award in excess of the amount claimed may be made.</P>

                <P>(b) In determining the amount allowable for repairs, the permanency of parts replaced will be considered and deductions made for depreciation as <PRTPAGE P="322"/>appropriated. Thus, an automobile tire is not expected to last through the life of a vehicle so that when a tire three-fourths worn is replaced with a new tire, the amount allowable is one-fourth of the cost of the new tire. The same principle applies to batteries and other items of equipment or accessories during relatively short wearout periods. However, no allowance for depreciation is made in replacing parts, such as fenders, bumpers, radiators, which normally would last through the life of the vehicle.</P>
                <P>(c) Deprivation of use of property (including motor vehicles) is allowable as an item of damages, but only in those cases where the claimant has sustained legally provable damages. Towing charges are also allowable items of damage. However, interest, cost of preparation of claim and of securing supporting evidence, inconvenience, and similar items are not property allowable items of damage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Military Academy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Organization and administration.</E> (1) The United States Military Academy is under the general direction and supervision of the Department of the Army. The Secretary of the Army has designated the Chief of Staff of the Army as the officer in direct charge of all matters pertaining to West Point.</P>
              <P>(2) The immediate government and military command of the Academy and the military post at West Point are vested in the Superintendent. In the absence of the Superintendent, the Deputy Superintendent, if present for duty, shall have such government and command. The Dean of the Academic Board has charge of the faculty and all academic work, and acts as representative of the academic departments and as adviser on academic matters to the Superintendent. The Commandant of Cadets is in charge of the administration and training of the Corps of Cadets and is also head of the Department of Tactics.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mission.</E> The mission of the United States Military Academy is to educate, train, and motivate the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate shall have the character, leadership, and other attributes essential to progressive and continuing development throughout a career of exemplary service to the Nation as an officer of the Regular Army.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Courses of instruction.</E> Courses include academic education and military training. In accomplishing its mission, the Military Academy strives to develop in each cadet the following traits:</P>
              <P>(1) The knowledge, skill, intellectual curiosity, discipline, and motivation provided by a sound education in the arts and sciences requisite for continued professional and intellectual growth.</P>
              <P>(2) A highly developed sense of personal honor and professional ethics.</P>
              <P>(3) Professional and personal commitment to the responsibilities of an officer for soldiers.</P>
              <P>(4) Selflessness.</P>
              <P>(5) The willing acceptance of responsibility for personal actions and the actions of subordinates.</P>
              <P>(6) The initiative and good judgment to take appropriate action in the absence of instructions or supervision.</P>
              <P>(7) Physical and moral courage.</P>
              <P>(8) The physical strength, endurance, and conditioning habits required of a soldier.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Admission; general.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In one major respect, the requirements for admission to the United States Military Academy differ from the normal requirements for admission to a civilian college or university; each candidate must obtain an official nomination to the Academy. The young person interested in going to West Point should, therefore, apply for a nomination from one of the persons authorized to make nominations listed in § 575.4. In the application, each prospective candidate should request a nomination to the United States Military Academy, and give residence, reasons for wanting to enter the Academy, and status of education and training.</P>

              <P>(b) A candidate's mental qualifications for admission are determined by performance on one of the regularly administered College Entrance Examination Board series of tests. The Military Academy will consider scores made on the tests which are offered in December, January, March, and May at more than 700 College Board Test Centers throughout the United States and abroad. In general, a center will be within 75 miles of the candidate's <PRTPAGE P="324"/>home. Candidates register for the prescribed tests in accordance with the regularly published instructions of the College Board and pay the required fee directly to the College Board.</P>
              <P>(c) The candidate's physical qualifications are determined by a thorough medical examination and physical aptitude test. To qualify, a candidate must be in good health, have good vision and hearing, have no deformities, and have the physical strength, endurance, coordination, and agility of active persons in their late teens. The medical examination and physical aptitude tests are held at selected military installations throughout the country (and overseas) on the Thursday and Friday preceding the regularly scheduled March administration of the College Board tests.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Appointments; sources of nominations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Admission to the Military Academy is gained by appointment to one of the cadetships authorized by law. Graduation of the senior class normally leaves about 915 vacancies each year. Candidates are nominated to qualify for these vacancies the year prior to admission. Those nominees appointed enter the Academy the following July and upon graduation are obligated to serve in the Army for a period of not less than 5 years. There are two major categories of nomination (Congressional/Gubernatorial and Service-Connected) and two minor categories (Filipino and Foreign Cadets). Cadetships authorized at the Military Academy are allocated among various sources of nominations from the major categories as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Congressional / Gubernatorial Nomination.</E> (1) Up to 10 nominations may be submitted for each vacancy. Nominating authorities may use one of three methods of nomination:</P>
              <P>(i) Name 10 nominees on a totally competitive basis,</P>
              <P>(ii) Name a principal nominee, with nine competing alternates, or</P>
              <P>(iii) Name a principal nominee, with nine alternates in order of preference.</P>
              <P>(2) The priority that a fully qualified candidate may receive when considered for appointment is actually governed by the method of nomination used. For example, a principal nominee who is found minimally qualified must be offered an appointment. Conversely, the same individual nominated on a totally competitive basis, may be ranked as one of the least qualified nominees for that vacancy and, consequently, may not be offered an appointment. Many nominating authorities hold preliminary competitive nomination examinations to select their nominees. Those selected are required to be actual residents of the geographic location represented by the nominating authority.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Service-connected nominations.</E> There is no restriction on the residence of nominees who compete for an appointment under these quotas. All applications for a service-connected nomination must be submitted to the Superintendent, United States Military Academy, West Point, NY 10996, not later than 15 December for the class entering the following July. A description of the Service-Connected nomination categories follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Presidential: Children of career military personnel in the Armed Forces who are on active duty, retired, or deceased, are nominated through this category. The term “career” includes members of the Reserve Components currently serving 8 or more years <PRTPAGE P="325"/>of continuous active duty and Reserve retirees receiving either retired or retainer pay. Children of reservists retired while not on active duty are ineligible. Applications should include the name, grade, social security number/service number, and branch of service of the parent as a member of such regular component, and the full name, address, and date of birth of the applicant (complete military address and social security number, if in the Armed Forces). Adopted children are eligible for appointment if they were adopted prior to their 15th birthday; a copy of the order of court decreeing adoption, duly certified by the clerk of the court, must accompany the application.</P>
              <P>(2) Children of Deceased and Disabled Veterans: This category is for children of deceased or 100 percent disabled Armed Forces veterans whose deaths or disabilities were determined to be service-connected, and for children of military personnel or federally employed civilians who are in a missing or captured status. Candidates holding a nomination under this category are not eligible for nomination under the Presidential or Medal of Honor category. The Veterans Administration determines the eligibility of all applicants. The application should include the full name, date of birth, and address of the applicant (complete service address should be given if the applicant is in the Armed Forces), and the name, grade, social security number/service number, and last organization of the veteran parent, together with a brief statement concerning the time, place, and cause of death.

Candidates appointed from this source may qualify in the same manner as a congressional principal candidate. All who are found fully qualified will be admitted as cadets, regardless of the number.</P>
              <P>(4) Honor Military Schools: Certain Honor Military Schools designated by Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force are invited to recommend three candidates for nomination annually from among their honor graduates. Appointments are filled by selecting the best qualified candidates regardless of the school from which nominated. Application should be made through the school Senior Army Instructor.</P>
              <P>(5) Army ROTC: This category is for members of college and high school Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps units. Application should be made through the Professor of Military Science or Senior Army Instructor at the school.</P>
              <P>(6) Regular Army: This category is for enlisted members of the active Army. Appointments may be awarded to 85 Regular Army candidates.

              <P>(7) Reserve Components: This category is for enlisted members of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard. Application for admission should be made through command channels to USMAPS. Enlisted members who are not on active duty should apply to the Commandant, United States Military Preparatory School, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey 07703.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Foreign cadets.</E> The law permits 20 persons at a time from the Latin-American Republics and Canada to receive instruction at the United States Military Academy. A maximum of three persons from any one country may be cadets at the same time. Such persons receive the same pay and allowances (including mileage from their homes in proceeding to the Military Academy for initial admission) as cadets appointed from the United States. <PRTPAGE P="326"/>However, they are not entitled to appointment in the United States Armed Forces upon graduation. Citizens of other foreign countries have been permitted from time to time to attend the Military Academy upon specific authorization of the United States Congress in each case. Applications must be submitted to the United States Government through diplomatic channels by the governments concerned. Requirements for the admission, advancement, and graduation of foreign cadets are similar to those for United States Cadets.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General provisions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Constitution, purpose, and jurisdiction of review board.</E> (i) The Army Disability Review Board (called the review board in this section) is an administrative agency created within the Department of the Army under authority of section 302, title I, Act of June 22, 1944 (58 Stat. 284), as amended by section 4, Act of December 28, 1945 (59 Stat. 623), to review, at the request of any officer retired or released from active service, without pay, for physical disability pursuant to the decision of a retiring board or disposition board, the findings and decisions of such board. The review board is charged with the duty, in cases within its jurisdiction, of ascertaining whether an applicant for review who was separated from the service or released to inactive service, without pay, for physical disability, incurred such physical disability in line of duty or as an incident of the service. When the review board determines in an individual case within its jurisdiction that physical disability was so incurred, it is authorized in the manner prescribed by this memorandum, to reverse prior findings in such regard and to make such findings in lieu thereof as are warranted by the evidence or pertinent regulations. Such remedial action is intended primarily to insure that no officer separated from the service or returned to an inactive status without pay, for disability, shall be deprived unjustly of retirement pay benefits, or retired status and retired pay, as the case may be, by reason of erroneous findings.</P>

              <P>(ii) The class of officers whose cases are reviewable shall include officers of the Army of the United States, other than officers of the Regular Army, who were discharged or released to inactive service under the conditions prescribed <PRTPAGE P="327"/>in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and former officers of the Regular Army who were wholly retired under section 1252, Revised Statutes.</P>
              <P>(iii) The review board is authorized, upon timely application therefor, to review the proceedings and findings of boards referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and to receive additional evidence bearing on the causes and service-connection of disabilities in the cases of officers referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, whose cases were the subject of findings by a retiring or disposition board, and who were separated from the service or released to inactive service, without pay, by reason of physical disability, whether denial of retirement or retirement pay benefits, as the case may be, was pursuant to the adverse findings of a board, or was pursuant to administrative action in a case where there was favorable action by a board.</P>
              <P>(iv) In carrying out its duties under this memorandum such review board shall have the same powers as exercised by, or vested in, the board whose findings and decisions are being reviewed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for review.</E> (i) Any officer desiring a review of his case will make a written application therefor on WD AGO Form 0258 (Application for Review of Army Retiring Board Proceedings) which may be obtained from The Adjutant General, Washington, DC 20310, Attention: AGPO-S-D.</P>
              <P>(ii) No application for review will be granted unless received by the Department of the Army within 15 years after the date on which such officer was separated from the service or released to inactive service, without pay, for physical disability, or within 15 years after June 22, 1944, whichever date is the later.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Adjutant General, upon receipt of an application for review, will note thereon the time of receipt thereof and will, in cases where the jurisdiction for review by the review board is established, assemble the originals or certified copies of all available Department of the Army and/or other record pertaining to the health and physical condition of the applicant, including the record of the proceedings and findings of all retiring and disposition boards in question and the records of all administration and/or executive action taken thereon. Such records, together with the application and any supporting documents submitted therewith, will be transmitted to the president of the review board.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Changes in procedure of review board.</E> The review board may initiate recommendation for such changes in procedures as established herein as may be deemed necessary for the proper functioning of the review board. Such changes will be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Army.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proceedings of review board</E>—(1) <E T="03">Convening of review board.</E> (i) The review board will be convened at the call of its president and will recess or adjourn at his order. In the event of the absence or incapacity of the president, the next senior member will serve as acting president for all purposes.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unless otherwise directed by its president, the review board will convene in Washington, DC, at the time and place indicated by him.</P>
              <P>(iii) The review board will assemble in open session for the consideration and determination of cases presented to it. After the conclusion of such hearing, the review board will as soon as practicable thereafter convene in closed session for determination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> (i) An applicant for review, upon request, is entitled by law to appear before the review board in open session either in person or by counsel of his own selection. Witnesses shall be permitted to present testimony either in person or by affidavit. As used in the regulations in this part the term “counsel” shall be construed to include members of the Federal bar, the bar of any state, accredited representatives of veterans' organizations recognized by the Veterans' Administration under section 200 of the Act of June 29, 1936 (49 Stat. 2031), and such other persons who, in the opinion of the review board, are considered to be competent to present equitably and comprehensively the claim of the applicant for review. In no case will the expenses or compensation of counsel for the applicant be paid by the Government.<PRTPAGE P="328"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) In every case in which a hearing is authorized, the secretary will transmit to the applicant and to designated counsel for the applicant, if any, a written notice by registered mail stating the time and place of hearing. Such notice shall be mailed at least 30 days in advance of the date on which the case is set for hearing except in cases in which the applicant waives the right of personal appearance and/or representation by counsel. Such notice shall constitute compliance with the requirement of notice to applicant and his counsel. The record shall contain the certificate of the secretary that written notice was given applicant and his counsel, if any, and the time and manner thereof.</P>
              <P>(iii) An applicant who requests a hearing and who, after being duly notified of the time and place of hearing, fails to appear at the appointed time, either in person or by counsel, or, in writing, waives his right to appear, thereby waives such right.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the conduct of its inquiries, the review board shall not be limited by the restrictions of common law rules of evidence.</P>
              <P>(v) In the case wherein it is advisable and practicable, the review board may, at the request of the examiner, or upon its own motion, request The Surgeon General to detail one or more medical officers to make physical examination of the applicant, if available, and report their findings resulting from such examination with respect to the matters at issue, either in person or by affidavit. When testifying in person at a hearing, such medical witnesses will be subject to cross-examination. Similarly the medical members of the board may examine the applicant, if available, and testify as witnesses concerning the results of such examination.</P>
              <P>(vi) Expenses incurred by the applicant, his witnesses, or in the procurement of their testimony, whether in person, by affidavit or by deposition will not be paid by the Government.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Continuances.</E> The review board may continue a hearing on its own motion. A request for continuance by the examiner or by or on behalf of the applicant may be granted, if in the board's discretion, a continuance appears necessary to insure a full and fair hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Findings, conclusions, and directions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Findings, conclusions, and directions of review board.</E> (i) The review board will make written findings in closed session in each case. Such findings will include:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) A finding affirming or reversing the findings of such retiring or disposition board or such administrative action, specifying which of the findings or administrative actions are affirmed and which are reversed.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the event the review board reverses any of such original findings or administrative actions, the review board will then make complete findings which shall include the affirmed findings of the original board or of administrative action subsequent thereto. Such complete findings shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Whether the applicant was permanently incapacitated for active service at the time of his separation from the service or release to inactive service.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The cause or causes of the incapacity.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">f</E>) Whether the cause or causes of the incapacity had been permanently aggravated by military service.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">g</E>) Whether such incapacity for active service was or was not the result of an incident of service.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">h</E>) Whether the officer's incapacity was or was not incurred in combat with an enemy of the United States or whether it did or did not result from an explosion of an instrumentality of war in line of duty.</P>

              <P>(iii) In the event the review board finds the officer permanently incapacitated for active service and that the incapacity was an incident of service, it will make an additional finding specifying the grade in which the officer is <PRTPAGE P="329"/>entitled to be retired or to be certified for retirement pay benefits.</P>
              <P>(iv) The findings, conclusions, and directions of a majority of the review board shall constitute the findings, conclusions, and directions of the review board, and when made, will be signed by each member of the review board who concurs therein, filed, and authenticated by the secretary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disposition of and action upon proceedings</E>—(1) <E T="03">Record of proceedings.</E> (i) When the review board has concluded its proceedings in any case, the secretary will prepare a complete record thereof. Such record shall include the application for review; a transcript of the hearing if any; affidavits, papers and documents considered by the review board; all briefs and written arguments filed in the case; the report of the examiner; the findings, conclusions, and directions of the review board; any minority report prepared by dissenting members of the review board; and all other papers and documents necessary to reflect a true and complete history of the proceedings. The record so prepared will be signed by the president of the review board and authenticated by its secretary as being true and complete. In the event of the absence or incapacity of the secretary, the record may be authenticated by a second participating member of the review board.</P>
              <P>(ii) All records of proceedings of the review board shall be confidential, except that upon written request from the applicant, his guardian or legal representative, The Adjutant General will furnish a copy of the proceedings of the review board, less any exhibits which it may be found impracticable to reproduce out which will include:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) A copy of the order appointing the board.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The findings of the Army retiring board affirmed.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) The findings of the Army retiring board reversed.</P>

The Adjutant General, subject to the foregoing restrictions, will make available for inspection, upon request of the applicant, his guardian or legal representative, a record of the proceedings of any case reviewed by the review board, but copies of the proceedings of any case heard prior to January 4, 1946, will not be furnished if such copies are not readily available.</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Final action by review board.</E> When the review board has completed the proceedings and has arrived at its decision, the proceedings, together with the review board's decision, will be transmitted to The Adjutant General for appropriate Department of the Army action. The Adjutant General, in the name of the President of the United States, will indicate on the record of such proceedings and decision the President's approval or disapproval of the action of the review board, and will perform such administerial acts as may be necessary and thereafter will notify the applicant and/or his counsel of the action taken. Written notice, specifying the action taken and the date thereof, will be transmitted by The Adjutant General to the president of the review board to be filed by the secretary as a part of the records of the board pertaining to each case.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Rehearings</E>—(1) <E T="03">Policy on the granting of rehearings.</E> After the review board has reviewed a case and its findings and decision have been approved, the case will normally not be reconsidered except on the basis of new, pertinent, and material evidence, which if previously considered could reasonably be expected to have caused findings and a decision other than those rendered as the result of the original review. An application for rehearing must be made within a reasonable time after the discovery of the new evidence, mentioned in this subparagraph, and the request for rehearing must be accompanied by such new evidence and by a showing that the applicant was duly diligent in attempting to secure all available evidence for presentation to the review board when his case was previously reviewed and that the reason for the delay in discovering such new evidence <PRTPAGE P="330"/>was not due to fault or neglect on the part of the applicant.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for rehearing.</E> Any officer desiring a rehearing of his case will make a written application therefor on WD AGO Form 0413 (Application for Review of Findings of the Army Disability Review Board) which may be obtained from The Adjutant General, Washington, DC 20310, Attention: AGPO-S-D.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">ABCMR establishment and functions</E>—(1) <E T="03">ABCMR establishment.</E> The ABCMR operates pursuant to law (10 U.S.C. 1552) within the Office of the Secretary of the Army. The ABCMR consists of civilians regularly employed in the executive part of the Department of the Army (DA) who are appointed by the Secretary of the Army and serve on the ABCMR as an additional duty. Three members constitute a quorum.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">ABCMR functions.</E> (i) The ABCMR considers individual applications that are properly brought before it. In appropriate cases, it directs or recommends correction of military records to remove an error or injustice.</P>
              <P>(ii) When an applicant has suffered reprisal under the Military Whistleblower Protection Act 10 U.S.C. 1034 and Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 7050.6, the ABCMR may recommend to the Secretary of the Army that disciplinary or administrative action be taken against any Army official who committed an act of reprisal against the applicant.</P>
              <P>(iii) The ABCMR will decide cases on the evidence of record. It is not an investigative body. The ABCMR may, in its discretion, hold a hearing (sometimes referred to as an evidentiary hearing or an administrative hearing in 10 U.S.C. 1034 and DODD 7050.6) or request additional evidence or opinions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Application procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Who may apply.</E> (i) The ABCMR's jurisdiction under 10 U.S.C. 1552 extends to any military record of the DA. It is the nature of the record and the status of the applicant that define the ABCMR's jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(ii) Usually applicants are soldiers or former soldiers of the Active Army, the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR), and in certain cases, the Army National Guard of the United States (ARNGUS) and other military and civilian individuals affected by an Army military record. Requests are personal to the applicant and relate to military records. Requests are submitted on DD Form 149 (Application for Correction of Military Record under the Provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1552). Soldiers need not submit applications through their chain of command.</P>
              <P>(iii) An applicant with a proper interest may request correction of another person's military records when that person is incapable of acting on his or her own behalf, missing, or deceased. Depending on the circumstances, a child, spouse, parent or other close relative, heir, or legal representative (such as a guardian or executor) of the soldier or former soldier may be able to demonstrate a proper interest. Applicants must send proof of proper interest with the application when requesting correction of another person's military records.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Time limits.</E> Applicants must file an application within 3 years after an alleged error or injustice is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered. The ABCMR may deny an untimely application. The ABCMR may excuse untimely filing in the interest of justice.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Administrative remedies.</E> The ABCMR will not consider an application until the applicant has exhausted all administrative remedies to correct the alleged error or injustice.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Stay of other proceedings.</E> Applying to the ABCMR does not stay other proceedings.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Counsel.</E> (i) Applicants may be represented by counsel, at their own expense.</P>

              <P>(ii) See DODD 7050.6 for provisions for counsel in cases processed under 10 U.S.C. 1034.<PRTPAGE P="333"/>

              <P>(ii) The applicant has not exhausted all other administrative remedies.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Burden of proof.</E> The ABCMR begins its consideration of each case with the presumption of administrative regularity. The applicant has the burden of proving an error or injustice by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">ABCMR consideration.</E> (i) A panel consisting of at least three ABCMR members will consider each application that is properly brought before it. One panel member will serve as the chair.</P>
              <P>(ii) The panel members may consider a case on the merits in executive session or may authorize a hearing.</P>
              <P>(iii) Each application will be reviewed to determine—</P>
              <P>(A) Whether the preponderance of the evidence shows that an error or injustice exists and—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If so, what relief is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If not, deny relief.</P>
              <P>(B) Whether to authorize a hearing.</P>
              <P>(C) If the application is filed outside the statute of limitations and whether to deny based on untimeliness or to waive the statute in the interest of justice.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> ABCMR hearings. Applicants do not have a right to a hearing before the ABCMR. The Director or the ABCMR may grant a formal hearing whenever justice requires.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Disposition of applications</E>—(1) <E T="03">ABCMR decisions.</E> The panel members' majority vote constitutes the action of the ABCMR. The ABCMR's findings, recommendations, and in the case of a denial, the rationale will be in writing.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">ABCMR final action.</E> (i) Except as otherwise provided, the ABCMR acts for the Secretary of the Army, and an ABCMR decision is final when it—</P>
              <P>(A) Denies any application (except for actions based on reprisals investigated under 10 U.S.C. 1034).</P>
              <P>(B) Grants any application in whole or in part without a hearing when—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The relief is as recommended by the proper staff agency in an advisory opinion; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Is unanimously agreed to by the ABCMR panel; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Does not involve an appointment or promotion requiring confirmation by the Senate.</P>
              <P>(ii) The ABCMR will forward the decisional document to the Secretary of the Army for final decision in any case in which—</P>
              <P>(A) A hearing was held.</P>
              <P>(B) The facts involve reprisals under the Military Whistleblower Protection Act, confirmed by the DOD Inspector General (DODIG) under 10 U.S.C. 1034 and DODD 7050.6.</P>
              <P>(C) The ABCMR recommends relief but is not authorized to act for the Secretary of the Army on the application.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Decision of the Secretary of the Army.</E> (i) The Secretary of the Army may direct such action as he or she deems proper on each case. Cases returned to the Board for further consideration will be accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons for such action. If the Secretary does not accept the ABCMR's recommendation, adopts a minority position, or fashions an action that he or she deems proper and supported by the record, that decision will be in writing and will include a brief statement of the grounds for denial or revision.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary of the Army will issue decisions on cases covered by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (10 U.S.C. 1034 and DODD 7050.6). In cases where the DODIG concluded that there was reprisal, these decisions will be made within 180 days after receipt of the application and the investigative report by the DODIG, the Department of the Army Inspector General (DAIG), or other Inspector General offices. Unless the full relief requested is granted, these applicants will be informed of their right to request review of the decision by the Secretary of Defense.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Reconsideration of ABCMR decision.</E> An applicant may request the ABCMR to reconsider a Board decision under the following circumstances:<PRTPAGE P="334"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) If the ABCMR receives the request for reconsideration within 1 year of the ABCMR's original decision and if the ABCMR has not previously reconsidered the matter, the ABCMR staff will review the request to determine if it contains evidence (including, but not limited to, any facts or arguments as to why relief should be granted) that was not in the record at the time of the ABCMR's prior consideration. If new evidence has been submitted, the request will be submitted to the ABCMR for its determination of whether the new evidence is sufficient to demonstrate material error or injustice. If no new evidence is found, the ABCMR staff will return the application to the applicant without action.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the ABCMR receives a request for reconsideration more than 1 year after the ABCMR's original decision or after the ABCMR has already considered one request for reconsideration, then the case will be returned without action and the applicant will be advised the next remedy is appeal to a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Claims/Expenses</E>—(1) <E T="03">Authority.</E> (i) The Army, by law, may pay claims for amounts due to applicants as a result of correction of military records.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Army may not pay any claim previously compensated by Congress through enactment of a private law.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Army may not pay for any benefit to which the applicant might later become entitled under the laws and regulations managed by the VA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Settlement of claims.</E> (i) The ABCMR will furnish DFAS copies of decisions potentially affecting monetary entitlement or benefits. The DFAS will treat such decisions as claims for payment by or on behalf of the applicant.</P>
              <P>(ii) The DFAS will settle claims on the basis of the corrected military record. The DFAS will compute the amount due, if any. The DFAS may require applicants to furnish additional information to establish their status as proper parties to the claim and to aid in deciding amounts due. Earnings received from civilian employment during any period for which active duty pay and allowances are payable will be deducted. The applicant's acceptance of a settlement fully satisfies the claim concerned.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment of expenses.</E> The Army may not pay attorney's fees or other expenses incurred by or on behalf of an applicant in connection with an application for correction of military records under 10 U.S.C. 1552.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Miscellaneous provisions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Special standards.</E> (i) Pursuant to the November 27, 1979 order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in <E T="03">Giles</E> v. <E T="03">Secretary of the Army</E> (Civil Action No. 77-0904), a former Army soldier is entitled to an honorable discharge if a less than honorable discharge was issued to the soldier on or before November 27, 1979 in an administrative proceeding in which the Army introduced evidence developed by or as a direct or indirect result of compelled urinalysis testing administered for the purpose of identifying drug abusers (either for the purposes of entry into a treatment program or to monitor progress through rehabilitation or follow-up).</P>
              <P>(ii) Applicants who believe that they fall within the scope of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section should place the term “CATEGORY G” in block 11b of DD Form 149. Such applications should be expeditiously reviewed by a designated official, who will either send the individual an honorable discharge certificate if the individual falls within the scope of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section, or forward the application to the Discharge Review Board if the individual does not fall within the scope of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section. The action of the designated official will not constitute an action or decision by the ABCMR.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Public access to decisions.</E> (i) After deletion of personal information, a redacted copy of each decision will be indexed by subject and made available for review and copying at a public reading room at Crystal Mall 4, 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia. The index will be in a usable and concise form so as to indicate the topic considered and the reasons for the decision. Under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), records created on or after November 1, 1996 will be available by electronic means.</P>

              <P>(ii) Under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 <PRTPAGE P="335"/>U.S.C. 552a), the ABCMR will not furnish to third parties information submitted with or about an application unless specific written authorization is received from the applicant or unless the Board is otherwise authorized by law.</P>

              <P>(i) Ensure that soldiers are informed of the DA policy on support of family members and that they comply with court orders. They will also inform soldiers of the possible consequences of failing to fulfill financial obligations. This information will be included during inprocessing and outprocessing briefings, particularly during processing for mobilization and oversea movement.<PRTPAGE P="336"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Process nonsupport complaints, child custody complaints, and paternity claims per this regulation.</P>
              <P>(iii) Counsel soldiers when complaints and claim are received. If the soldier is suspected of criminal conduct, self-incrimination protections (article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and rights advisement) must be provided. (See § 584.2(g)(4).)</P>
              <P>(iv) Answer all correspondence received from CG, USACFSC and other DA officials. In answering this correspondence, the commander will—</P>
              <P>(A) Furnish complete details regarding nonsupport complaints, child custody complaints, and paternity claims.</P>
              <P>(B) Reveal whether or not the soldier authorized the release outside the Department of Defense (DOD) of information obtained from a system of records. His or her decision should be recorded on DA Form 5459-R (Authorization to Release Information from Army Records on Nonsupport/Child Custody/Paternity Complaints).</P>
              <P>(v) Answer all correspondence received directly from family members, legal assistance attorneys, and others. Normally, replies will not include information obtained from a system of records without the soldier's written consent. (See § 584.1(f).) Commanders may coordinate responses with the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). Also, the commander will ask the SJA for guidance in unusual or difficult situations.</P>
              <P>(vi) Inform the first level field grade commander of all instances of the soldier's repeated failure to meet the requirements of this regulation or to comply with court orders. Also, point out actions taken or contemplated to correct instances of nonsupport of family members or continuing violations of court orders.</P>
              <P>(vii) Refer correspondence or queries received from news media organizations to the unit, installation, or command public affairs officer for response.</P>
              <P>(viii) Take appropriate action against soldiers who fail to comply with this regulation. These actions include, but are not limited to, the actions in § 584.1(d)(5)(viii) (A) through (E). Failure to comply with the minimum support requirements (§ 584.2(d)) or the child custody provisions (§ 584.2(e)) of this regulation may be charged as violations of article 92, UCMJ. Article 132, UCMJ, prohibits the making of false claims. Article 133, UCMJ, covers conduct unbecoming an officer. Article 134, UCMJ, concerns dishonorable failure to pay debts and conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces. Also, the criminal laws of some States prohibit the abduction of children by a parent or the nonsupport of family members in violation of existing court orders. These laws may also apply against soldiers under article 134, UCMJ, and Assimilative Crimes Act, section 13, title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 13).</P>
              <P>(A) Denial of reenlistment for enlisted members (AR 601-280).</P>

              <P>(x) After coordination with the SJA and appropriate command representatives, and under applicable State, Federal, and host country laws, take remedial steps to assist in the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Elimination of continuing violations of court orders and this regulation on child custody.</P>
              <P>(B) Return of such children to the parent or guardian entitled to custody.</P>
              <P>(6) The unit, installation, or command public affairs officer will—</P>
              <P>(i) Answer correspondence and queries received from news media organizations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Coordinate with the SJA before making any response.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Policy.</E> (1) Soldiers of the Army are required to manage their personal affairs statisfactorily. This responsibility includes—</P>
              <P>(i) Providing adequate and continuous support to or for family members. (See § 584.2.)</P>
              <P>(ii) Complying with all court orders.<PRTPAGE P="337"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The Army has an interest in the welfare of both soldiers and their families. This is recognized by numerous laws and programs authorizing the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Family housing.</P>
              <P>(ii) Living and travel allowances.</P>
              <P>(iii) Medical care.</P>
              <P>(iv) Child care and development.</P>
              <P>(v) Community support services.</P>
              <P>(3) Because of military duty, soldiers and their families often live in States in which they have not established domicile. Frequently, they reside in foreign nations. This often places soldiers beyond the judicial process of State courts.</P>
              <P>(4) The Army recognizes the transient nature of military duty. This regulation prohibits the use of a soldier's military status or assignment to deny financial support to family members or to evade court orders on child support or custody. Commanders have a responsibility to ensure that soldiers provide for the welfare of their families. Before recommending approval of requests for, or extensions of, oversea assignments, commanders should consider whether the soldier's oversea assignment will adversely affect the legal rights of family members in pending court actions against the soldier.</P>
              <P>(5) The policy in this regulation regarding the financial support of family members is solely intended as an interim measure until the parties—</P>
              <P>(i) Arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Resolve their differences in court.</P>
              <P>(6) Soldiers are entitled to the same legal rights and privileges in State courts as civilians. This includes determining the extent and amount of their support obligations to family members. This regulation is not intended to be used as a guide by courts in determining the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The existence of support obligations.</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of past, present, or future support obligations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Release of information.</E> (1) Soldiers will be provided the opportunity of completing DA Form 5459-R before being questioned about compliants or claims under this regulation. Information voluntarily provided by soldiers may be used by commanders to answer inquiries. Replies normally will not include information obtained from a system of records without the soldier's written consent.</P>
              <P>(2) Some information may be released outside DOD from a system of records even without the soldier's written consent. Under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(2) and AR 340-21, para 3-3), information may be released, if required, under the Freedom of Information Act. Under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6) and AR 340-17, chapter III, information from personnel and other similar files may be released if it does not constitute a “clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.” The information released must be in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(3) The type of information that may be released from a system of records without the soldier's consent will vary from case to case. In each case, the public interest of having soldiers support their families and obey court orders must be balanced against the sensitivity of the privacy interests involved. Army policy favors permanent resolution of support and custody matters in court. The denial of information that hinders such resolution is not in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(4) Before releasing information from a system of records without the soldier's consent, commanders may consult the SJA. Generally, the types of information shown below may be released to the complaining family member entitled to support or those authorized by the family member to act in his or her behalf (for example, legal assistance attorneys, Member of Congress, courts, Government welfare agencies).</P>
              <P>(i) Present unit of assignment, including port calls and future duty assignments, permanent or temporary, if known.</P>

              <P>(iv) Allotments authorized or being authorized for or in behalf of the family member entitled to support.</P>
              <P>(v) The soldier's stated intentions, if any, regarding resolution of the complaint.</P>

              <P>(6) Any information released should be pertinent to the inquiry. The soldier's relationship, if any, to the person making the inquiry, should be considered. Consistent with the purpose of this regulation, information that unduly invades the privacy of the soldier or his or her family should not be released.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Penalties.</E> Compliance with the minimum support requirements § 584.2(d)) and child custody provisions (§ 584.2(e)) of this regulation will be enforced by administrative and criminal remedies as appropriate.</P>

The minimum support requirements of this regulation are stated in amounts equal to a soldier's BAQ at the “with dependents” rate. However, a soldier's entitlement or lack of entitlement to such allowances has no relationship to the obligation under this regulation to support family members. Except for § 584.2(f)(2)(ii)(B), the actual receipt or nonreceipt of BAQ also has no relationship to that obligation.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Entitlement of variable housing allowance.</E> Soldiers entitled to BAQ at the “with” or “without dependents” rate may be entitled to variable housing allowance (VHA).

              <SUBJECT>Family support and child custody.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) This chapter requires soldiers to provide financial support to family members and to obey court orders on child custody. It also provides guidance and policy to commanders to follow when resolving nonsupport and child custody issues. Consistent with specific provisions below, a soldier will—</P>
              <P>(i) Furnish financial support to family members that meets at least the minimum support requirements of this regulation (§ 584.2(d)).</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide such additional support within his or her financial ability to meet the financial needs of family members (§ 584.2(j)).</P>
              <P>(iii) Comply with all court-imposed obligations (§ 584.2(c)(3)).</P>
              <P>(iv) Obey court orders and this regulation on child custody and visitation rights (§ 584.2(e)).</P>
              <P>(2) It is the responsibility of soldiers to resolve nonsupport issues with family members by one of the methods shown in § 584.2(a)(2)(i) through (iii). In all cases, Army support policy for family members should be considered temporary until either an agreement has been reached between the parties (including those acting on behalf of minor children) or court action has been taken.</P>
              <P>(i) Oral agreements.</P>
              <P>(ii) Written support agreements.</P>
              <P>(iii) Court orders.</P>
              <P>(3) Each complaint of nonsupport will be considered individually by the soldier's immediate commander. Alleged desertion or other marital misconduct on the part of a spouse has no effect on a soldier's obligation to provide financial support as required by § 584.2(d).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Separation from family due to military service.</E> Military service often requires soldiers to live separately from their families during oversea service or extended temporary duty. Soldiers must plan carefully for the support of their families during these periods. Commanders will educate soldiers and their families on the advantages of joint bank accounts. Such arrangements usually minimize the hardship and financial burden on family members that may occur during periods of such separation. If proper, commanders will urge soliders to start an allotment to or for their family to ensure continuous financial support. The amount of such a support allotment should be set up by agreement between the soldier and his or her family. In the absence of such an agreement or a court order, the provisions of § 584.2(d)(2) apply. <PRTPAGE P="339"/>Each soldier is expected to keep reasonable contact with family members to minimize inquiries, claims, and compliants sent to Army officials.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Support by oral agreement, written support agreement, or court order</E>—(1) <E T="03">Oral agreement.</E> It is not the Army's policy to involve itself in disputes over the terms or enforcement of oral support agreements. Where an oral agreement exists and is being followed, the Army need not and will not interfere. When a dispute arises, the Army will require compliance only with the provisions of this regulation. Thus, if a family member complains that a soldier is not sending an agreed upon amount that is less or more than the minimum required by § 584.2(d), the commander will advise the soldier to either send the agreed upon amount or the minimum amount required by § 584.2(d). Section 584.2(d) applies when the parties cannot reach an oral agreement or the amount agreed upon is in dispute. In appropriate cases, the commander can order additional support beyond the minimum amount required by § 584.2(d). (See § 584.2(j).)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Written support agreement.</E> If the parties are separated and have a signed written agreement, the amount of support specified in such an agreement controls. A signed written agreement includes a separation agreement or a property settlement agreement. A written agreement on support also may be shown by letters exchanged between the parties in which the amount of support has been agreed to by the parties. If the agreement is silent on an amount of spousal and/or child support, the interim minimum financial support requirements of § 584.2(d)(2) apply. The amount specified in the written agreement will be deemed adequate until modified by—</P>
              <P>(i) Another agreement reduced to writing and signed by both parties.</P>
              <P>(ii) Court order.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Court order.</E> (i) Court orders often contain other financial obligations, such as provisions for property division, marital property awards, and payment of medical and other expenses. Commanders have a responsibility to ensure that soldiers comply with these provisions. Soldiers will comply with all court-imposed obligations. Failure to do so may result in costly and time-consuming litigation or court contempt proceedings. These actions often are to the detriment of the soldier and the unit's readiness mission. Section 584.2 (d)(1)(i), however, only applies to court orders directing the soldier to provide financial support to family members on a periodic basis.</P>
              <P>(ii) Court orders under this regulation include those orders issued by the courts of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). The courts must have acquired valid jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of articles 32 through 37 of the Supplementary Agreement concerning foreign forces stationed in the FRG. This agreement supplements the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Status of Forces Agreement. A soldier will comply with all other foreign nation court and administrative orders that are recognized by treaty or international agreement.</P>
              <P>(iii) Commanders should be aware that conditions may have changed greatly from when a court order was issued. For example, a soldier may have gained other family responsibilies. Many outstanding and uncontested support orders against soldiers cause severe hardship. Such orders can only be modified by a court. If a soldier's income appears inadequate to satisfy an outstanding order and still maintain the soldier, the commander should urge the individual to consult a legal assistance attorney. However, the soldier will comply with the terms of a court order until relieved of this obligation by modification of the order by a court.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Minimum support requirements.</E> (1) Soldiers will not violate the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Financial support provisions of a court order.</P>
              <P>(ii) Financial support provisions of a written support agreement in the absence of a court order.</P>
              <P>(iii) Interim minimum financial support requirements of § 584.2(d)(2) in the absence of a court order or written support agreement.</P>

              <P>(2) In the absence of a court order or written support agreement, and until such an order or agreement is obtained, the following interim <E T="03">minimum</E> financial support requirements apply:<PRTPAGE P="340"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Single family units.</E> (A) Family not living in Government family quarters. The soldier will provide support in an amount equal to the soldier's BAQ at the with-dependents rate. This amount of financial support will be provided for this family unit regardless of whether or not the soldier is—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Receiving BAQ.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Occupying Government family quarters.</P>
              <P>(B) Family living in Government family quarters. While the supported family is occupying Government family quarters, the soldier will provide an amount equal to the difference between BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rate. When the supported family members move out of Government family quarters, support will be provided in an amount equal to BAQ at the with-dependents rate for the soldier's rank.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Multiple-family units.</E> In multi-family unit support situations, each supported family member will receive a pro-rata share of the BAQ at the with-dependents rate. This share will be determined by dividing an amount equal to BAQ at the with-dependents rate for the soldier's rank by the total number of supported family members (excluding former spouses). The following modifications apply: First, any court ordered support will be paid as stated. Secondly, supported families living in Government family quarters will receive an amount equal to the difference between BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rate for the soldier's rank. Lastly, any remaining family members (excluding former spouses) will receive a pro-rata share of the BAQ amount. This will be provided regardless of the amount of support paid to other family members. Following are examples:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A soldier is divorced and has three children from that marriage. The soldier is required by a court order to pay $300 per month for the children and $100 per month for the former spouse. The soldier has remarried and has two more family members (spouse and child) living in private housing. The soldier now has a total of five family members that he or she must support under Army policy. (A former spouse does not qualify as a family member in pro-rata determinations.) The children by the previous marriage must receive $300 and the former spouse must receive $100 per the court order. The present spouse and child should receive support equal to two-fifths of BAQ at the with-dependents rate for the soldier's rank.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A soldier has one child by a previous marriage. There is no court order for child support. The soldier is unable to show that the court granting the divorce had personal jurisdiction over the soldier so as to be able to order child support. The soldier has remarried and has a spouse and two children living in private housing. The soldier now has a total of four family members that he or she must support under Army policy. (These family members are the child by a previous marriage and the present spouse and two children.) Each family member should receive support equal to one-fourth of BAQ at the with-dependents rate for the soldier's rank.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> A soldier has two children by a previous marriage. The soldier is required by court order to pay $200 per month for these children. Also, the soldier is required to pay $75 per month for support of a child per a court order that has declared him to be the father. He has remarried and has a spouse and three children living in Government family quarters. The soldier now has a total of seven family members that he must support under Army policy. The children by his previous marriage must receive $200 per the court order. His other child must receive $75 per the court order. The spouse and children of his present marriage should receive an amount equal to the difference between BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rate for the soldier's rank.</P>
              <P>(iii) Military members married to one another. In the absence of a court order or written support agreement, an Army soldier is not required to provide support to a spouse on active duty in the Armed Forces.</P>
              <P>(iv) Children of military member parents.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Single family units.</E> In the absence of a court order or written support agreement, the following interim support requirements apply:<PRTPAGE P="341"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Single family units when the Army soldier does not have custody of any children of the marriage. The Army soldier will pay an amount equal to the difference between his or her own BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rate to the military member having custody of the child or children of the marriage. This amount of financial support will be provided regardless of which military member, if any, is receving BAQ or occupying Government family quarters.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Single family units when the Army soldier has custody of the child or children of the marriage (for example, Army soldier has custody of one child and spouse has custody of two children). In this situation, the Army soldier is not required to provide a minimum amount of financial support for the children in the other military member's custody.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Multiple-family units.</E> The provisions of § 584.2(d)(2)(ii) apply. However, the amount in § 584.2(d)(2)(iv)(A) will not be diminished by proration because of the Army soldier's financial support obligations to other family members. For example: An Army soldier has an adopted child from a previous marriage. The soldier is required by court order to pay $150 per month for this child. The soldier presently is married to a spouse on active duty with the Air Force. They have two children from this marriage. The Air Force member and children reside in private housing. The Army soldier has a total of three family members that he or she must support. The Army soldier will pay $150 a month to the adopted child per the court order. The children from the present marriage will receive an amount equal to the difference between his or her BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rates for the Army soldier's rank.</P>

              <P>(3) A commander has no authority to excuse a soldier from complying with the interim <E T="03">minimum</E> support requirements of § 584.2(d)(2) when they are applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) In the absence of a contrary provision in a written support agreement or court order, monthly financial support to family members will be sent before the last calendar day of the month for which the support is due. If the family members are not residing together, the soldier will ensure each family member receives his or her pro-rata share. (For example, spouse lives along and the children live with their grandparents.)</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Child custody.</E> (1) A soldier relative, who is aware that another person is a lawful custodian of an unmarried child under the age of 14 years, will not—</P>
              <P>(i) Abduct, taken, entice, or carry away the child from the lawful custodian.</P>
              <P>(ii) Withhold, detain, or conceal the child away from the lawful custodian.</P>
              <P>(2) A “lawful custodian” is a person authorized, either along or together with another person or persons, to have custody and exercise control over a child less than 14 years of age by order of a court. The fact that joint custody has been awarded to both parents by a court does not preclude a violation of this paragraph by the soldier parent. However, in the absence of a court order to the contrary, the mother of a child born out of wedlock who is not then, nor has ever been, married to the father of the child is deemed the “lawful custodian” of that child for the purpose of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(3) A soldier relative is a soldier who is the parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, or one who has at some time been the lawful custodian of the child.</P>
              <P>(4) It is a defense to a violation of this paragraph that the soldier—</P>
              <P>(i) At the time of the offense had custody of the child to the exclusion of others pursuant to a valid order of a court having jurisdiction over the child; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Voluntarily returned the child to the lawful custodian within 96 hours after return was demanded by the lawful custodian.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Relief from the minimum support requirement.</E> (1) Court orders with financial support provisions.</P>
              <P>(i) Court ordered financial support will be by the terms of the court order. Relief from a court order can only be obtained under the law. Nothing in this regulation affects or lessens a soldier's legal obligation to comply strictly with the terms of a court order.</P>

              <P>(ii) A soldier who disobeys a court order may be held in contempt of the <PRTPAGE P="342"/>court that issued the order. Also, a soldier may be punished for violating this regulation. It is, however, a defense to any violation of § 584.2(d)(1)(i) that—</P>
              <P>(A) The court issuing the order was without jurisdiction to do so, and</P>
              <P>(B) The soldier at all times has been complying with any of the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The financial support provisions of another court order.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The financial support provisions of a written support agreement.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The interim minimum financial support requirements of § 584.2(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Court orders without financial support provisions.</P>
              <P>(iii) A soldier will provide financial support to family members unless expressly relieved of this obligation by—</P>
              <P>(A) Court order.</P>
              <P>(B) Written support agreement.</P>
              <P>(iv) A soldier will provide financial support under § 584.2(f)(2) to family members, which meets at least the minimum support requirements of this regulation. The financial support will be provided even when a court order contains no provision as to support except as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) A soldier has no obligation to provide financial support to a former spouse except by order of court.</P>
              <P>(B) A soldier has no obligation to provide financial support to minor children of the marriage if he or she can show the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The court issuing the final order of divorce had personal jurisdiction over the soldier to order child support.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The soldier is not receiving BAQ at the “with dependents” rate based solely on the support of the minor children in question.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Written support agreements.</E> If a financial support obligation is evidenced by a written agreement between the parties, the soldier can only be relieved of this obligation by another written agreement or by court order.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) <E T="03">Greater spousal income.</E> In the absence of a written support agreement or court order, a soldier has no obligation to support a civilian spouse who is receiving an annual income equal to or greater than the annual gross pay of the soldier. The income of the spouse does not affect the soldier's obligation to provide financial support to the children of that marriage in the physical custody of the spouse on a pro-rata basis. Example: A soldier is living in Government family quarters with one of their children. The soldier's spouse deserted the soldier and lives in private housing with their other child. The soldier's spouse earns $5,000 more in annual income from a civilian job than the soldier earns in annual gross pay. There is no court order or written support agreement. The soldier has a total of three family members. However, under Army support policy, the soldier does not have to provide a pro-rata share of financial support to the spouse because the spouse's income exceeds that of the soldier. (Note that under § 584.2(a)(3) marital misconduct is not a relevant consideration.) The soldier must support the child in Government family quarters. In addition, the soldier must provide an amount equal to one-third of BAQ (pro-rata share) at the “with dependents” rate to the spouse on behalf of the child living with the spouse.</P>

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Commander's inquiries.</E> (1) If a soldier denies he or she has a financial obligation to support a spouse or children for any reason, the soldier's commander will—</P>
              <P>(i) Inquire into the matter.</P>
              <P>(ii) Consult with the SJA prior to determining whether or not there is a support obligation. If there is no support obligation, BAQ at the “with dependents” rate should be stopped.</P>
              <P>(2) If a soldier claims he or she has made support payments as required by this regulation, the soldier's commander will—</P>
              <P>(i) Request the soldier to provide proof of payment in one of the following forms:</P>
              <P>(A) Canceled personal checks.</P>
              <P>(B) Leave and earnings statements showing allotments.</P>
              <P>(C) Postal or money order receipts accompanied by a sworn statement from the soldier that the order was sent to the family member. If possible, evidence that the postal or money order was cashed by the complaining party should be provided.</P>
              <P>(D) Other acceptable evidence of payment.<PRTPAGE P="343"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Consult with the SJA, if necessary, to determine whether the soldier has provided enough proof of payment.</P>
              <P>(3) If a soldier is suspected of violating a child custody or visitation rights in a court order, the soldier's commander will—</P>
              <P>(i) Inquire into the matter.</P>
              <P>(ii) Consult with the SJA prior to taking action.</P>
              <P>(4) In any case in which the soldier is suspected of violating this regulation (§ 584.2(d) or (e)), or of having committed other offenses, the commander, prior to questioning the soldier, will advise him or her of—</P>
              <P>(i) The suspected offense.</P>
              <P>(ii) The right to remain silent under article 31, UCMJ.</P>
              <P>(iii) The right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Form of support payment.</E> (1) Unless otherwise provided in the court order or by agreement, a financial support payment will be made in one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(i) In cash.</P>
              <P>(ii) By check or money order.</P>
              <P>(iii) By allotment.</P>
              <P>(2) A soldier will receive credit for payments made to others on behalf of, and with the agreement of, the supported family members. Examples of support provided in kind include—</P>
              <P>(i) Rent.</P>
              <P>(ii) Utility services.</P>
              <P>(iii) Interest and principal due on loans, mortgages, or charge accounts.</P>
              <P>(iv) Insurance payments.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Arrearages</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A soldier who falls into arrears without legal justification or excuse is in violation of § 584.2(d).</P>
              <P>(2) Court orders and written support agreements.</P>
              <P>(i) Amounts in arrears based on a past failure to comply with a court order or written support agreement will be paid at once in a lump sum amount. If an immediate lump sum payment is impractical, soldiers are expected to work out arrangements with the court or the affected family members to pay arrearages on a scheduled basis. If arrangements can not be worked out, commanders will intervene and order payment of arrearages on a scheduled basis based on the soldier's ability to pay.</P>
              <P>(ii) When arrearages arise from noncompliance with court orders and written support agreements, this may result in—</P>
              <P>(A) Garnishment of the soldier's pay account (§ 584.8).</P>
              <P>(B) Initiation of an involuntary allotment against the soldier's pay account (§ 584.9).</P>
              <P>(C) Contempt of court proceedings.</P>
              <P>(D) Recoupment of BAQ received by the soldier.</P>
              <P>(iii) Administrative or punitive action may be taken on a violation of this regulation for any month in which the soldier failed to provide the required financial support even if the amount in arrears eventually is paid.</P>
              <P>(3) Interim minimum financial support requirements. A soldier should be encouraged to pay the amount in arrears based on past noncompliance with the interim minimum financial support requirements (§ 584.2(d) (1)(iii) and (2)). However, a soldier cannot be ordered to pay such an amount. Nevertheless, administrative or punitive action may be taken on a violation of this regulation for any month in which the soldier failed to provide the required financial support even if the amount in arrears eventually is paid. Also, failure to provide required financial support in the past may be considered, together with other factors, in a commander's determination of the amount of additional support that may be ordered. (See § 584.2(j).)</P>
              <P>(j) Additional support where there is no support agreement or court order.</P>
              <P>(1) Ordinarily, a soldier should not be required to provide financial support beyond that required by § 584.2(d)(1)(iii). However, a soldier should provide additional support within his or her ability to meet the basic financial needs of family members when the interim support requirements of this regulation are shown to be inadequate.</P>

              <P>(2) If there is a demonstrated need for immediate and temporary additional support because of unexpected and unforeseen circumstances and the parties are unable to agree on such additional support, a commander may order temporary additional support.<PRTPAGE P="344"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Commanders will consider the following factors in determining the amount of additional support, if any, that a soldier should provide when a request for additional support is received:</P>
              <P>(i) The pay, allowances, separate income, and other financial resources of both the soldier and the family member for whom additional support is requested.</P>
              <P>(ii) The earning capacity of the family member on whose behalf support is requested.</P>
              <P>(iii) The financial savings of the soldier and family member.</P>
              <P>(iv) The separate and joint debts of the soldier and family member, by whom those debts were incurred, and the reasons behind them.</P>
              <P>(v) The soldier's duty to provide financial support to other family members, including former spouses.</P>
              <P>(vi) The financial needs of the soldier and the family member and whether these needs are temporary or permanent in nature.</P>
              <P>(vii) The standard of living of the soldier and family member and whether such standard of living is reasonable under the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(viii) With regard to spousal support, the duration of the marriage and the circumstances under which the parties separated.</P>
              <P>(ix) The extent of the soldier's or family member's compliance with existing court orders and written support agreements. This includes those provisions dealing with child custody, visitation rights, property division, and marital property awards.</P>
              <P>(x) The amount in arrears owed by the soldier based on past noncompliance with the minimum support requirements. (See § 584.2 (d) and (i).)</P>
              <P>(xi) Any other fact which, in the judgment of the commander, has a logical bearing upon the amount of additional support the soldier reasonably should be expected to provide.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Procedure for making complaints.</E> (1) Complaints about nonsupport of family members and noncompliance with court orders on financial support and child custody should be sent through command channels. The complainant should be referred to the immediate commander of the soldier concerned.</P>
              <P>(2) The Inspector General (IG) may assist in properly routing the complaint. The IG also may assist if the responsible commander has failed to respond in a satisfactory manner or as required by this regulation. (See AR 20-1, para 4-9.)</P>
              <P>(3) The USACFSC (DACF-IS-PA) has set up an office to assist in these cases. USACFSC will provide policy interpretations and guidance on unresolved or complex cases, as needed. USACFSC normally will go through command channels to the immediate commander of the soldier concerned requesting that action be taken under this regulation.</P>
              <P>(4) Family members who present complaints against a military member of another Service (Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, or Coast Guard) should be referred to the appropriate Service.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Commander's actions.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a complaint of nonsupport or noncompliance with court orders, including provisions on child custody or visitation rights, the commander will review the complaint. He or she will do the following if the information is incomplete:</P>
              <P>(i) Acknowledge receipt of the complaint.</P>
              <P>(ii) Explain that the information or documentation sent is not enough to give proper help.</P>
              <P>(iii) If appropriate, send the complainant DA Form 5460-R (Request for Help in Receiving Support and/or Identification Cards for Family Members).</P>
              <P>(iv) Advise that help will be given with the complaint upon return of the completed form and other requested information and documents.</P>
              <P>(v) If appropriate, advise that DA Form 5460-R alone is not enough documentation for issuance of a dependent identification card (ID card) (AR 640-3). Documentation (that is, court orders, birth certificates, marriage certificates, etc.) must be provided to support eligibility for benefits.</P>
              <P>(vi) Answer any policy or procedural questions that have been asked.</P>

              <P>(2) Upon receipt of DA Form 5460-R or a complaint that has enough information to properly respond, the commander will—<PRTPAGE P="345"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Review soldier's legal financial obligations in light of the complaint and the facts presented by all parties concerned.</P>
              <P>(ii) If necessary, ask the SJA if the complaint is valid, if the soldier must provide financial support or give up custody of children, and any other related questions.</P>
              <P>(iii) Notify the soldier of the complaint of nonsupport or of a violation of a child custody court order.</P>
              <P>(iv) Require the soldier to complete and sign DA Form 5459-R. Information obtained from a system of records ordinarily will not be released outside DOD without the soldier's consent. (See § 584.1(f).)</P>
              <P>(v) If the soldier is suspected of violating this regulation or of having committed other offenses, the commander, prior to questioning the soldier, will also advise him or her of—</P>
              <P>(A) The suspected offense.</P>
              <P>(B) The right to remain silent under article 31, UCMJ.</P>
              <P>(C) The right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment.</P>
              <P>(vi) Explain the following to the soldier:</P>
              <P>(A) The Army's policies regarding support of family members and compliance with court orders.</P>
              <P>(B) That refusal to give required support per this regulation may result in administrative or punitive action.</P>
              <P>(C) That a soldier is not entitled to BAQ at the “with dependents” rate when no part of the allowance is given to family members. Therefore, collection action may be initiated by the Army.</P>
              <P>(vii) Explain what garnishment is (§ 584.8) and how it might affect the soldier's pay, allowances, and allotments. For example, explain that the amount garnisheed monthly might significantly exceed monthly support obligations previously agreed upon.</P>
              <P>(viii) Tell the soldier of any court order for attachment or garnishment that has been received. Immediately send the court documents to the Commander, U.S. Army Finance and Accounting Center (USAFAC), ATTN: FINCL-G, Indianapolis, IN 46249-0260 for action. (See § 584.8(b).) Also, inform the soldier that if the document is in proper legal form, a portion of the soldier's pay and allowances will be garnisheed.</P>
              <P>(ix) Explain involuntary allotments (§ 584.9) if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(x) Coordinate with the soldier's servicing finance and accounting office (FAO) for problems of pay, allowances, and allotments.</P>
              <P>(xi) Urge soldiers to provide continuous support to family members by allotment. The allotment should be for the mutually agreed amount, court order, or as computed under this regulation. An account may be set up in a financial institution by the recipient to receive the allotment. This action may preclude delays in receipt and other related problems in the future.</P>
              <P>(xii) Help the soldier start an allotment to make the required support payments. Also, advise the soldier to let the commander know if there is a change or stoppage to the support allotment.</P>
              <P>(xiii) Give the soldier a chance to consult with a legal assistance attorney if he or she desires. However, the commander should ensure that this is not used as a delaying tactic. Where appropriate, a support payment plan should be initiated without delay.</P>
              <P>(xiv) Urge soldiers thinking about divorce to seek legal advice from a legal assistance attorney. Also, advise the soldier to ensure an amount of support is included in the court order for their children. This action may help to prevent future disputes.</P>
              <P>(xv) Ensure that the soldier is not receiving BAQ at the “with dependents” rate when not entitled to it. (See § 584.7.)</P>
              <P>(xvi) Ask the soldier about his or her intentions. Give the soldier the chance to furnish a voluntarily signed statement admitting or denying the complaint and stating his or her intentions.</P>
              <P>(xvii) Send complaints received to the soldier's new duty station if he or she has been reassigned. Advise the complainant of the soldier's reporting date and the unit address to which correspondence should be sent. If proper, give the complainant a copy of DA Form 5460-R.</P>

              <P>(3) Advise the complainant courteously and promptly—<PRTPAGE P="346"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Of the Army policy in suitable areas of concern.</P>
              <P>(ii) Of the soldier's intentions, if the soldier allows release of the information.</P>
              <P>(iii) That personal problems outside the requirements of this regulation must be resolved in court if the parties cannot agree.</P>
              <P>(4) If proper to the situation, remind complainant of other helping agencies on post, such as the chaplain and Army Community Service. These agencies can give timely, interim help to meet immediate needs pending a more permanent resolution of the problem.</P>
              <P>(5) Retain the statements allowing or forbidding release of information to the complainant and the soldier's intentions with the case file for future reference. Documents/records will be filed per AR 600-37 and the Army Functional Files System (AR 340-2 and AR 340-18).</P>
              <P>(6) Monitor actions closely to ensure promises of support or other actions by soldiers to complainants are being met.</P>
              <P>(7) Consider administrative or punitive action if proper.</P>
              <P>(8) Inform the first level field grade commander of the soldier's repeated failure to meet the requirements of this regulation. Also, point out actions taken or contemplated to correct instances of nonsupport of family members or violations of child custody court orders.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) This chapter sets policy and procedures to process paternity claims against male Army soldiers. These procedures apply to claims made in the continental United States and in foreign countries. They apply to claims made by the claimant or on behalf of the claimant by attorneys, court officials, and others.</P>
              <P>(2) Soldiers will be informed of paternity claims against them. Commanders will ensure that soldiers are advised of their legal rights and will advise soldiers of their moral and legal obligations in the matter. Soldiers admitting paternity will be urged to provide the necessary financial support to the child. Also, they will take any other action proper under the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) Procedures for questioning soldiers about paternity claims upon receipt of a claim of paternity against a soldier, the commander will take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) If there is evidence that an offense (for example, rape, indecent acts with a minor) may have been committed—</P>
              <P>(i) Inform law enforcement officials.</P>
              <P>(ii) Inform the soldier of the suspected offense. Before questioning, advise the soldier of his right to remain silent under article, 31, UCMJ, and his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment.</P>
              <P>(iii) Coordinate further action under this regulation with the SJA and law enforcement officials if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) If there is no evidence that an offense was committed—</P>
              <P>(i) Allow the soldier a chance to talk with a legal assistance attorney about his legal rights and obligations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Require the soldier to complete and sign DA Form 5459-R. Information obtained from a system of records normally will not be released outside DOD without the soldier's consent. (See § 584.1(f).)</P>

              <P>(iv) Advise the soldier that a court order against him on the paternity claim, followed by a refusal to support a child born out of wedlock, could result in—</P>
              <P>(A) Administrative or punitive action for violating this regulation.</P>
              <P>(B) Garnishment of the soldier's pay account (§ 584.8).</P>
              <P>(C) Initiation of an involuntary allotment against the soldier's pay account (§ 584.9).</P>
              <P>(D) Contempt of court proceedings.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(C) Admits paternity, but refuses to provide financial support.</P>
              <P>(ii) No action can be taken on the claim of paternity in the absence of a court order. The court order must identify the soldier in question as the father of the child. Also, the court order must direct that the soldier provide financial support to the child.</P>
              <P>(2) The commander will reply directly to the claimant or the attorney or court official she has authorized to act in her behalf. Information obtained from a system of records ordinarily will not be released outside DOD without the soldier's consent. (See § 584.1(f).)</P>
              <P>(3) If the soldier admits paternity and agrees to provide financial support, then the commander will—</P>
              <P>(i) Ask the claimant to provide a copy of the birth certificate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Help the soldier in filing for an allotment or providing other financial aid.</P>

              <P>(iv) Help the soldier apply for BAQ at the “with dependents” rate, if applicable. (A birth certificate may be required.)</P>
              <P>(v) Ensure an ID card is issued for the child after the relationship is documented, if proper. (A birth certificate may be required.) (See AR 640-3, para 3-3, for dependency criteria for ID cards.)</P>
              <P>(vi) Allow the soldier to take ordinary leave in order to marry the claimant, if leave is requested for this purpose. However, the leave may be delayed if it will interfere with military requirements. Travel in connection with leave (including travel to and from overseas commands) is the responsibility of the soldier. Travel will be at no expense to the Government. If the marriage is to take place overseas, the soldier must comply with AR 600-240 and AR 608-61 in applying for authorization to marry (DA Form 2029-R) (Application for Authorization to Marry Outside of the United States).</P>

It applies to those situations where another person is trying to adopt a legitimate or illegitimate child of a soldier. A child born in or out of wedlock normally may not be put up for adoption without the consent of the parents. Therefore, communications from a judge or court asking that a soldier appear at an adoption hearing must be answered.</P>

              <SUBJECT>U.S. citizenship determinations on children born out of wedlock in a foreign country.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A child born out of wedlock in a foreign country of an American citizen father and an alien mother does not automatically gain U.S. citizenship. The child must first be legally acknowledged by the father. Marriage to the mother may be required in order for the child to acquire U.S. citizenship. The father also must establish that he had at least 10 years of physical presence in the United States prior to the child's birth. Five of those years must have been spent in the United States after the father's 14th birthday. United States military service counts as physical presence in the United States. (See 8 U.S.C. 1101(c)(1), 1401(g), and 1409(c).) Whether the child gains the citizenship of its mother depends entirely upon the laws of the nation in which she is a citizen.</P>
              <P>(2) A child born out of wedlock in a foreign country to an American citizen mother and an alien father or U.S. Citizen father gains U.S. citizenship at birth if the mother had been physically present in the United States for a continous period of 1 year prior to the child's birth. (See 8 U.S.C. 1409(c).) The child will gain the citizenship of the father only if the laws of the nation of which the father is a citizen so provide.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures for claiming U.S. citizenship rights.</E> (1) A father desiring rights of U.S. citizenship for a foreign-born child must legally acknowledge the child as his own and prepare a case file. Each case is decided on its own merits. The Department of State, if the child is in a foreign nation, or the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), if the child is in the United States, will make the decision. Documents that may be important in supporting a citizenship determination are listed below:</P>
              <P>(i) Proof of father's citizenship. This may consist of any of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) A certified copy of his birth certificate (with a raised seal of the registrar of births).</P>
              <P>(B) A report of birth abroad (FS Form 240 (Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States)).</P>
              <P>(C) A certificate of citizenship.</P>
              <P>(D) A certificate of naturalization.</P>
              <P>(E) A valid U.S. Passport.</P>
              <P>(F) A certified copy of an approved U.S. passport application.</P>
              <P>(G) Any secondary evidence acceptable by the State Department or INS.</P>
              <P>(ii) Affidavit of paternity.</P>
              <P>(iii) Proof of presence in the foreign country at time of conception. (This information can be extracted from the passport, DA Form 2-1 (Personnel Qualification Record—Part II), etc.).</P>
              <P>(iv) Child's birth certificate.</P>
              <P>(v) Proof of the father's physical presence in the United States for 10 years (5 after age 14).</P>
              <P>(vi) Blood type tests of the mother, the father, and the child. (At the request of the examining officer.)</P>
              <P>(vii) Two sworn affidavits (at the request of the examining officer) from individuals who personally knew the mother, father, and child at the time of birth and can identify the child.</P>
              <P>(viii) A copy of a certified English translation of all needed legal documents that are in a foreign language.</P>
              <P>(ix) An executed passport application with three signed pictures of the child.</P>

              <P>(2) The soldier may consult a legal assistance attorney for help in preparing the case file. The case file should be taken to the nearest American Embassy, Consulate General, or Consulate in the country where he and his child live. If the father is not <PRTPAGE P="349"/>present in the country where the child lives, he will do one of the following—</P>
              <P>(i) Take the necessary documents to the nearest American Embassy, Consulate General, or Consulate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Mail the documents to the Department of State, ATTN: Office of Citizens Consular Service, WASH DC 20520. That office, in conjunction with the American Consul abroad, will decide if the child is a U.S. citizen.</P>
              <P>(3) If both father and child are within the United States, a decision of citizenship status can be obtained from the INS. The soldier should file Form N-600 (Application for Certificate of Citizenship) at the nearest INS office. This form can be obtained from the INS. The appendix of AR 608-3 lists the location of INS offices.</P>
              <P>(4) Any soldier who claims to be a U.S. citizen has the burden of proving that claim to the Department of State or INS, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedures governing nonactive duty personnel.</E> (1) Nonsupport complaints and paternity claims against former soldiers or other not on active duty will be sent to the Commander, U.S. Army Reserve Components Personnel and Administration Center (RCPAC), ATTN: DARC-PSE-VS, 9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, MO 63132-5200.</P>
              <P>(2) After RCPAC verifies the status, the following officials will act as prescribed below:</P>
              <P>(i) Chief, National Guard Bureau, WASH DC 20310-2500, for members of the Army National Guard.</P>
              <P>(ii) The area commander concerned for Ready Reservists assigned to troop program units under his or her control. (See AR 140-1, para 1-6.)</P>

              <P>(3) The officials cited above will ensure that correspondence claiming nonsupport or paternity is delvered to the person concerned, using military channels. When the correspondence cannot be delviered through military channels, it will be sent to the last known mailing address of the person by certified mail (PS Form 3811 (Return Receipt, Registered, Insured and Certified Mail)). It should be marked “Return Receipt Requested—Deliver to Addressee Only.” This form is available at U.S. post offices.</P>
              <P>(4) After delivery of correspondence, the responsible official will advise the complainant or claimant—</P>
              <P>(i) Of the date and method of delivery.</P>
              <P>(ii) That the military department does not control the personal affairs of nonactive duty personnel. These personnel usually are in a civilian status and are not subject to military discipline. Therefore, the matter has been left to the person's discretion.</P>
              <P>(iii) Of the person's mailing address only if the conditions in § 584.6(c) are met.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures governing discharged personnel.</E> Nonsupport complaints or paternity claims against persons who have been discharged from the Service will be sent to RCPAC.

              <P>(1) That the person is no longer a member of the Army or the Reserve Components.</P>
              <P>(2) Of the date of discharge.</P>
              <P>(3) That the Army no longer has control or authorty over the discharged member. Therefore, the Army can take no further action in the matter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basic allowance for quarters.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> (1) Soldiers entitled to basic pay, who have family members, are entitled to BAQ at the rates prescribed for soldiers “with dependents” under certain conditions. The Department of Defense Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual (DODPM) governs entitlements. (See DODPM, part 3, chap 2.)</P>
              <P>(2) Soldiers may receive BAQ at the “with dependents” rate as long as they pay at least the difference between BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rate each month in support of their families. (See DODPM, part 3.) This is so even if a divorce decree or court order is silent on support or releases the soldier from the responsibility of supporting the family. (See § 584.2(f)(2).) Normally, a soldier is not entitled to BAQ on behalf of a former spouse or stepchildren after the divorce. BAQ at the “with dependents” rate is not authorized when the soldier or the supported family is residing in Government family quarters. Also, if two soldier member-parents are supporting the same child, only one soldier member is entitled to BAQ at the “with dependents” rate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">False claims.</E> BAQ at the “with dependents” rate is not payable to soldier who are not supporting their families. Cases involving alleged failure or refusal of soldiers to pay at least the difference between BAQ at the with- and without-dependents rate for the support of family members will be referred to the proper FAO after investigation. Nonsupport of family members for whom BAQ is claimed may result in—</P>
              <P>(1) Collection of BAQ received but not given to the family members.</P>
              <P>(2) Stoppage of BAQ at the “with dependents” rate.</P>
              <P>(3) Punitive or administrative action against a soldier for—</P>
              <P>(i) Violating the minimum support requirements of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Submitting a fraudulent claim for BAQ based on false information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Forfeiture of BAQ.</E> Forfeiture of the “with dependents” portion of BAQ does not relieve the soldier of the obligation to support family members as set up in this regulation.</P>
              <P>(d) BAQ entitlements versus Army minimum support requirements Terms for entitlements to BAQ are set forth in DODPM, part 3, chapter 2. Except as provided in this regulation, BAQ entitlements have no relationship to Army minimum support requirements.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Pub. L. 93-647 (42 U.S.C. 659) permits garnishment, attachment, or assignment of Federal wages and retirement payments to enforce court-ordered child support and alimony obligations that are in arrears. It includes foreign court orders when—</P>
              <P>(i) Required by treaty or international agreement. (A soldier is subject to garnishment for child support issued by the FRG only while physically stationed in Germany.)</P>
              <P>(ii) Recognized by a court of competent jurisdiction. Applicable State laws govern legal procedures to be used by complainants. Jurisdictional or procedural challenges to garnishment actions remain the responsibility of individual members.</P>
              <P>(2) In the absence of State law more favorable to the soldier, 15 U.S.C. 1673 limits the amount of pay that can be garnisheed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Fifty percent of disposable pay when a soldier is supporting a spouse or dependent child who is not the subject of the support order. (See § 584.8(a)(3) for an explanation of disposable pay.)</P>

              <P>(ii) Sixty percent of disposable pay when a soldier is not supporting such spouse or dependent child.<PRTPAGE P="351"/>
              </P>

              <P>(3) The items of pay listed in § 584.8(a)(3)(i) are subject to garnishment except for amounts deducted for the items listed in § 584.8(a)(3)(ii).</P>

However, all legal process issued by German courts will be processed under DODPM, section 70710, when the soldier is stationed in the FRG.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Pub. L. 97-248 (42 U.S.C. 665) permits involuntary allotments from pay and allowances of soldiers on active duty as child, or child and spousal, support payments when—</P>
              <P>(1) The soldier has failed to make payments under a court order for 2 months or in a total amount equal to or in excess of the support obligations for 2 months.</P>
              <P>(2) Failure to make such payments is established by notice from an authorized person to the Commander, USAFAC, ATTN: FINCL-G, Indianapolis, IN 46249-0160. An authorized person is—</P>
              <P>(i) Any agent or attorney of any State having in effect a plan approved under part D of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651-664), who has the duty or authority under the plan to seek recovery of any amounts owed as child or child and spousal support (including, when authorized under a State plan, any official of a political subdivision).</P>

              <P>(3) Such notice must give the soldier's full name and SSN. Also, it must list the name and address of the person to whom the allotment is payable. The amount of the allotment will be the amount needed to comply with the support order. The allotment may include arrearages as well as amounts for current support if provided for in the support order. A copy of this must be included with the notice. If proper, a statement must be included that the support allotment qualifies for the additional 5 percent in excess of the maximum percentage limitations. These limitations are prescribed in 15 U.S.C. 1673. Also, a copy of the underlying support order must be included with the notice. An allotment under this provision will be adjusted or discontinued only upon notice from an authorized person.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> No action will be taken to set up an allotment until the soldier has the chance to consult a <PRTPAGE P="352"/>legal assistance attorney. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect to the soldier's support obligation and failure to make payments. If the soldier has not consulted with legal counsel, the allotment will start the first end-of-month payday after 30 days have elapsed since notice was given to the affected soldier.</P>

              <P>(a) This part (chapter) implements procedural guidance in Department of Defense Directive 552 5.9, “Compliance of DoD members, employees, and family members outside the United States with court orders.” This guidance applies to all soldiers and Department of the Army and Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) civilian employees serving outside the United States, as well as to their command sponsored family members.</P>

              <P>(3) Have been ordered to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for failing to obey a court order.</P>
              <FP>This guidance does not affect the authority of Army officials to cooperate with courts and federal, state, or local officials, such as is currently described in Army Regulation 27-3, Legal Services, Army Regulation 190-9, Military Absentee and Deserter Apprehension Program, and Army Regulation 608-99, Family Support, Child Custody, and Paternity, in enforcing orders against soldiers and employees in matters not discussed below. The guidance below does not authorize Army personnel to serve or attempt to serve process from U.S. courts on military or DoD employees overseas. (See also AR 27-40, Litigation, paragraph 1-7.)</FP>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Courts of federal, state, or local officials desiring to initiate a request for assistance pursuant to this section must forward the request, with appropriate court orders, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For soldiers and members or their family, to the soldier's unit commander of Office, Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (ODCSPER), ATTN: DAPE-MP (703-695-2497); and</P>
              <P>(2) For Department of the Army civilian employees and members of their family, to the servicing civilian personnel office for the employee's command, or ODCSPER, ATTN: DAPE-CPL, (703-697-4429).</P>
              <P>(3) Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) employees and members of their family, to the servicing civilian personnel office for the employee's command, or ODCSPER, ATTN: CFSC-HR-P (703-325-9461).</P>
              <P>(b) Upon receipt of such requests for assistance concerning courts orders described in paragarph (a) of this section and AR 190-9, commanders/supervisors, with the advice of their servicing Judge Advocates and legal advisors, will take action as appropriate as outlined below:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine whether the request is based on an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. An “order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction” is an order that appears valid on its face and is signed by a judge.</P>
              <P>(2) If the order appears valid on its face and is signed by a judge, attempt to resolve the matter in a timely manner to the satisfaction of the court without the return of, or other action affecting, the soldier, Army civilian employee, or family member. Due regard should be given to mission requirements, applicable international agreements, and ongoing DoD investigations or courts-martial.</P>
              <P>(3) If the matter cannot be resolved, afford the subject of the court order a reasonable opportunity to provide evidence of legal efforts to resist the court order or otherwise show legitimate cause for noncompliance. If it is determined that efforts to provide such evidence or to show cause for noncompliance warrant a delay in taking further action, a request for delay, not to exceed 90 days, must be sought from the Secretary of the Army. Such requests, fully setting forth the reasons justifying delay and the estimated delay necessary, will be forwarded within 30 days directly to ODCSPER, ATTN: DAPE-MP (for military personnel and their family members or ODCSPER, ATTN: DAPE-CPL (for Army civilian employees and their family members) or ODCSPER, ATTN: CFSC-HR-P (for NAF employees and their family members). These offices must promptly forward the request for delay to the Assistant Secretary of Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) ASA(M&amp;RA), for approval. If a delay is approved, ASA(M&amp;RA) will promptly notify the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel) ASD (FM&amp;P), copy furnished General Counsel, Department of Defense (GC, DOD).</P>

              <P>(4) If one, the matter cannot be resolved, and two, it appears that noncompliance with the request to return the soldier, or to take other action involving a family member or DA or NAF employee is warranted by all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and three, the court order does not pertain to any felony or to a contempt involving the unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from the jurisdiction of the court or the custody of a parent or another person awarded custody by court order, the matter will be forwarded, for soldiers or their family members to the soldier's general court-martial convening authority or, for army civilian or NAF employees or their family members, to the fairest general officer or civilian equivalent in the employee's chain of command, for a determination as to whether the request should be complied with. In those cases in which it is determined that noncompliance with the request is warranted, copies of that determination will be forwarded directly to the appropriate office noted in § 589.4(b)(3) and to HQDA, DAJA-CL, pursuant to chapter 6, AR 190-9.<PRTPAGE P="356"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) If one, the matter cannot be resolved, and two, it appears that noncompliance with the request to return the soldier, or to take other action involving a family member of DA or NAF employee, is warranted by all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and three, the court order pertains to any felony or to a contempt involving the unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from the jurisidiction of a court or the custody of a parent or another person awarded custody by court order, a request for exception to policy will be forwarded directly to the appropriate office listed in § 589.3(b)(3) with an information copy to HQDA, DAJA-AL, within 30 days unless a delay has been approved by ASA(M&amp;RA). The offices listed in § 589.3(b)(3) must forward the request for an exception promptly through ASA(M&amp;RA) to ASD(FM&amp;P) for decision, copy furnished to General Counsel, DOD.</P>
              <P>(6) All actions, whether to invoke the DOD Directive or not, must be reported promptly to ASD(FM&amp;P) and General Counsel, Department of Defense. See also DOD Directive 5525.9, paragraph E.3.c.</P>
              <P>(c) If requests for military personnel cannot be resolved without return of the individual, and denial of the request as outlined in this section is not warranted, the individual will be ordered pursuant to section 721, Public Law 100-456 and DODD 5525.9 to the appropriate U.S. part of entry at government expense, provided the federal, state, or local authority requesting the individual provides travel expenses including a prepaid transportation ticket or equivalent and an escort, if appropriate, from the port of entry to the appropriate jurisdiction. Absent unusual circumstances, requesting parties will be notified at least 10 days before the individual is due to return. Guidance concerning use of military law enforcement personnel to effect the return of military personnel to U.S. civil authorities may be obtained from the U.S. Army Military Policy Operations Agency (MOMP-O).</P>
              <P>(d) In accordance with DoD policy, military personnel traveling pursuant to a contempt order or show cause order, as described in this part and in AR 614-XX is entitled to full transportation and per diem allowances. However, this does not alleviate the requesting parties' requirement to pay travel expenses from the appropriate U.S. port of entry. Any travel expenses received from the requesting party must be deducted from the soldier's entitlement to travel and per diem allowances. The soldier will be returned in a temporary duty (TDY) status, unless a permanent change of station (PCS) is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(e) If requests for Army civilian and NAF employees cannot be resolved and denial of the request as outlined in this section is not warranted, the individual will be strongly encouraged to comply with the court order. Failure to comply with such orders by an Army civilian or NAF employee, if all criteria are met, is a basis for withdrawal of command sponsorship and adverse action against the employee, to include removal from federal service. Proposals to take disciplinary/adverse actions must be coordinated with the appropriate civilian personnel office (CPO) and the servicing Judge Advocate or legal advisor and forwarded for approval to the first general officer or civilian equivalent in the employee's chain of command. A copy of the final action taken on the case must be forwarded to HQDA, ATTN: DAPE-CPL, or ATTL: CFSC-HR-P (for NAF employees).</P>
              <P>(f) If the request is based upon a valid court order pertaining to a family member of a soldier or Army civilian or NAF employee, the family member will be strongly encouraged to comply with the court order if denial of the request as outlined in this part is not warranted. Unless the family member can show legitimate cause for non-compliance with the order, considering all of the facts and circumstances, failure to comply may be basis for withdrawal of command sponsorship.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part sets forth policies and procedures for loan of Army materiel. As used in this regulation, the term “loan” includes a lease.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This regulation applies to all Department of the Army (DA) agencies, commands, installations, and activities.</P>
              <P>(2) This regulation applies to the Army National Guard (ARNG) only when the procedure for the loan of equipment under the procedure of National Guard Regulation (NGR) 735-12 does not apply.</P>
              <P>(3) This regulation does not apply to loans governed by the DOD Military Assistance and Sales Manual, DOD 5105.38-M.</P>
              <P>(4) This regulation does not apply to loans governed by the Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This part outlines when loans of Army materiel may be made. It gives general procedures for requesting and processing loans, and sets forth <PRTPAGE P="371"/>responsibilities, including requirements for reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Explanation of terms.</E> (1) The terms “loan,” “lease” and “bailment” are contractual terms and are frequently used interchangeably. They have no meaning by themselves. It is necessary to study the statute to see what is required. Usually, a “loan” is thought of as a short-term transfer of property, sometimes with reimbursement; a “lease” is a more formal transfer, often long-term and requiring a fair monetary rental; and a “bailment” is a loosely-used term, generally reserved for a delivery of property to another in trust for the purpose of doing something to the property and then returning the property to the owner. The term “issue” is frequently used in the sense of a transfer of property which will be consumed in use. The terms “gift,” meaning a permanent transfer of property without reimbursement, and “sale,” meaning a permanent transfer with reimbursement, are outside the scope of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(2) For additional definitions, see appendix A.</P>
              <P>(3) The words “he, him, his” when used in this publication represent both the masculine and feminine genders, unless otherwise specifically stated.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Loan restrictions.</E> (1) Army materiel is not normally used for other than the Army's primary mission; however, under conditions described herein materiel not immediately needed to support mission requirements may be loaned to—</P>
              <P>(i) Army and other Department of Defense (DOD) elements.</P>
              <P>(ii) Non-DOD Federal departments and agencies.</P>
              <P>(iii) Civil governments (State and local).</P>

              <P>(2) Table 2-1 lists various circumstances where loan of Army materiel might be requested. It identifies the applicable Federal laws or other authority which would authorize such loans.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Statutory authorities.</E> There are three basic federal laws which authorize the loan of Army property. There are also numerous specific statutes which authorize particular types of loans in limited situations. Unless there is a reason to use the specific statute, one of the basic statutes will be used.</P>
              <P>(1) The following are the basic statutes:</P>

              <P>(2) Following are some of the specific authorizing statutes:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan policies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Loan and approval policy</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic policies.</E> (i) Materiel is not loaned to non-DOD activities as a routine procedure. However, materiel in the Army inventory is available for loan for special purposes if approved. Approving authorities are listed in table 2-1; their addresses are in appendix B.</P>
              <P>(ii) Loans will be approved or disapproved based on the purpose, duration of the loan, and consideration of the following factors which can take precedence over any loan.</P>
              <P>(A) Military requirements and priorities.</P>
              <P>(B) Continuity of military operations, troop survival, and the rehabilitation of essential military bases.</P>
              <P>(C) Stocks and programed Army requirements. This includes prepositioned mobilization reserve stocks.</P>
              <P>(D) Type classification with pending changes.</P>
              <P>(E) Minimum diversion of Army stocks.</P>
              <P>(F) The adequacy of the borrower's resources. Requesters will be encouraged to use their own resources.</P>

              <P>(iii) Loan requests from civilian authorities or activities will normally enter Army channels at the installation or MACOM levels. If on-post or off-<PRTPAGE P="373"/>post units receive loan requests, they will refer them to unit's supporting installation commander at once. Emergency loan requests will be relayed by telephone or electrically transmitted message.</P>
              <P>(iv) When routine handling of a loan request would result in loss of human life, grave bodily harm, or major destruction of property, and when the lack of communication facilities prevents use of normal procedures, loans otherwise permitted by this regulation can be made with local approval. However, normal policy should be followed to the extent possible. If procedural requirements cannot be fully complied with, they must be met as soon as possible after the loan is made.</P>
              <P>(v) Army materiel loaned under this part will be delivered to borrower “as is, where is” available.</P>
              <P>(vi) Stocks of the least serviceable condition which are still suitable for the loan's purpose will be used. Logistic control code “C” materiel will be loaned before logistic control code “B” materiel. Logistic control code “B” materiel will be loaned before logistic control code “A” materiel. (Ref chap 9, AR 708-1.)</P>
              <P>(vii) Commanders of medical treatment facilities (MTF) are subject to all the requirements of this regulation, including the requirement for reimbursement. However, in accordance with AR 360-61 which implements DOD Instruction 5410.19,</P>
              <P>(A) Emergency loans of medical supplies (drugs, vaccines, etc.) may not be made without reimbursement, but the loan may not exceed 30 days and the medical supplies must be replaced in kind by the borrowing agency or activity; and</P>
              <P>(B) Emergency loans of medical equipment not to exceed 15 days may be made without reimbursement if it is the practice in the community for other hospitals to make such loans. Equipment loans which exceed 15 days must be approved, in writing, by the MACOM commander and are subject to all the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2667, including reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(viii) Army property loaned to non-DOD activities will not be further loaned without approval of the original approving authority.</P>
              <P>(ix) There will be no procurement or redistribution of assets to offset the effects of loans. Material will not be set aside, earmarked, assembled, or stockpiled to be available for use related to loans.</P>
              <P>(x) Army materiel may be recalled from the borrower at any time to meet Army requirements.</P>
              <P>(xi) Stock record accounting and financial transactions for loans will conform with existing regulations.</P>
              <P>(xii) Borrowers are responsible for the care, custody, and proper use of materiel borrowed. Except as stated in this regulation, reimbursement will be required for damage, destruction, loss, fair depreciation in value, and for any Army repair, care, transportation, preservation, and protection of loaned equipment.</P>
              <P>(xiii) Care, renovation, and repair of borrowed materiel will conform with the loan agreement.</P>
              <P>(xiv) As indicated below, borrowers must provide signed loan agreements, provide surety bonds, and vehicular insurance prior to receipt of materiel. Loan agreements and bonds will be prepared in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Loans to DOD organizations.</E> Army materiel may be loaned to DOD activities for projects, programs, and mission requirements that support basic functions of the borrowing activity. Examples are field exercises, maneuvers, training exercises, including annual training (AT) of Reserve Components, and research development, test, and evaluation (RDTE).<PRTPAGE P="374"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Loans of major end items belonging to MACOMs are approved by MACOM or UCOM commanders. Loans of materiel other than major end items are approved at commander/installation level.</P>
              <P>(ii) Loans of materiel belonging to DARCOM (wholesale level) are approved as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Materiels other than major end items.</E> By the director or deputy director of an MRC.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">All other items.</E> By HQ DARCOM or commanders of MRCs unless loan would interfere with issue against DA Master Priority List (DAMPL) priorities, then by HQDA ODCSLOG (DALO-SMD).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Loans to federal departments/agencies.</E> Loans to Federal activities outside the DOD are usually provided under provisions of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 686. Federal agencies borrowing DOD materiel using the provisions of this act are responsible for reimbursing the DOD for all DOD costs incident to the delivery, return, and repair of the materiel. The borrower is also responsible for reimbursing the DOD for depreciation if the depreciation cost is significant.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disaster relief.</E> (i) CONUS/OCONUS. (A) In disaster situations local civil authorities must provide relief from their own resources. If this is not sufficient, and the American National Red Cross has a team at the disaster, requests for further assistance should be made to them. If the President has declared a major disaster or emergency, requests should be made to the regional director of the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration (FDAA). (See AR 500-60 for guidance.)</P>
              <P>(B) The commanding General, US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), acting for the Secretary of the Army (SA), is responsible for Army materiel support of disaster relief operations within the United States and the District of Columbia. UCOMs are responsible for disaster relief operations in US possessions and trust territories. These commanders are authorized to task DOD agencies and commands, consistent with defense priorities, to provide materiel in support of operations. A military representative will be appointed by the appropriate command to act as the DOD point of contact with the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) when military assistance is required during a Presidential declared disaster or emergency. When a disaster or emergency is of such magnitude, the disaster area may be geographically subdivided. A military representative will then be appointed for each FCO. All requests for military assistance will be passed through the FCO to the DOD military representative at the disaster area.</P>
              <P>(C) The Director of Military Support (ODCSOPS), HQDA, acts at the DOD point of contact for the Administrator, FDAA, other Federal agencies, and the American National Red Cross in all disaster assistance matters.</P>
              <P>(ii) Foreign. (A) The Department of State is responsible for deciding when emergency foreign disaster relief operations will be undertaken. This authority is delegated to Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions for disaster relief operations whose total costs will not exceed $25,000.</P>
              <P>(B) Send queries on foreign disaster relief to HQDA (DAMO-ODS) (para 4, app B).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Civil disturbances.</E> The maintenance of law and order is primarily the responsibility of local and state authorities. In civil disturbance situations, a basic goal of the Federal Government is to minimize the involvement of active military forces. One of the most effective means of keeping Federal forces off the streets is to loan US Army civil disturbance type equipment to Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and also to the National Guard. (For specific guidance see AR 500-50.)</P>
              <P>(i) Requests for loan of Army materiel during or for expected civil disturbances are of three types with approval authority as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Group one.</E> Arms, ammunition, tank-automotive equipment, and aircraft. Loans will be approved by the SA or his designee.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Group two.</E> Riot control agents, concertina wire, and similar military equipment which is not included in group one. Loans will be approved by the SA (or his designee), or by an Army task force commander employed at an <PRTPAGE P="375"/>objective are during a civil disturbance.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Group three.</E> Protective equipment such as masks and helmets; body armor vests; other equipment not included in group one or two such as clothing, communications equipment, and searchlights; and the use of DOD facilities. Such loans will be approved by the SA (or his designee); by MACOMs; by the CGs of CONUS armies, MDW, and by commanders of UCOMs outside CONUS as applicable. (NOTE: Firefighting equipment will not be used for riot control).</P>
              <P>(ii) Queries concerning loans in support of civil disturbances will be forwarded to the Director of Military Support, HQDA(DAMO-ODS), WASH DC 20310. (See app B.)</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Terrorism.</E> (i) The Department of the Army is the DOD Executive Agent for support to the FBI in combating terrorism. Existing civil disturbance loan procedures, including categories of equipment, apply to equipment loans to the FBI for combating terrorism. Military resources will be provided only upon request of the Director, FBI, or the Senior FBI official present at the scene of a terrorist incident. It may be difficult in some situations to determine whether a practical incident fits the definition of terrorism. In these cases, commanders are authorized to accept the judgment of the FBI official making the request if it is supported by the available facts. (See para 3, table 2-1.)</P>
              <P>(ii) For requests from the FBI in connection with terrorist incidents, any commander in the chain of command down to and including commanders of military installations are authorized to approve loans of group two and group three resources. (See paragraphs (a)(4)(1) (B) and (C) of this section.) Requests for equipment which involve technical/operating personnel, excluding fire-fighting equipment and explosive ordnance disposal, will be processed as a group one resource. For example, approval authority is retained by the DOD Executive Agent.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Aircraft piracy.</E> Assistance to other federal agencies in the protection of airways is provided through loans under guidance in paragraph 3, table 2-1. Specific limitations on such support are covered in AR 500-1.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Loan/lease to activities outside the Federal Government.</E> Title 10, U.S.C. 2667, authorizes the lease of Army materiel to non-DOD departments, agencies, activities, or individuals when it is determined that the materiel is not, for the period of the lease, needed for public use, is not excess property, and that the loan will promote the national defense or be in the public interest, (See AR 360-61.) Such a lease must not be for more than 1 year (or be renewed/extended for a total period of more than 5 years); it must provide that the lessee will pay a fair monetary rental. The fair monetary rental will be determined on the basis of prevailing commercial rates or computed according to sound commercial accounting practices for the fixing of rental on such property. This will include a return on capital investment and administrative cost as well as depreciation. The delegation of authority to lease is SAOSA-71-6, paragraph 1-5103, ADARS, the prescribed lease agreement is at paragraph 16-553, ADARS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan agreements.</E> (1) Upon approval of a loan request and before shipment or issue of the materiel, the approving authority will complete a written loan agreement, DA Form 4881-R. In all cases, the statutory basis for the loan will be cited. The approving authority is acting for the DOD on loans to other Federal agencies, and for the United States on loans to civil authorities and special activities. The agreement will be signed by the approving authority and the borrowing activity. When emergency loans have been made as authorized by this AR, follow-up action will be taken at once to formalize the loan by completing a loan agreement.</P>

              <P>(2) Loan agreements are mutually developed by the approving authority and the chief of the borrowing activity (or their designees). The agreements identify the responsibilities of all parties. They include terms and conditions of the loan. Appendix C illustrates a sample loan agreement, DA Form 4881-R (Agreement for the Loan of US Army Materiel), and specifies what the loan agreements will stipulate and contain. Also illustrated at appendix C is DA <PRTPAGE P="376"/>Form 4881-2-R, which will be completed and appended to the loan agreement as “Exhibit I.”</P>
              <P>(3) Loan agreements will be held by the approving authority until termination and final settlement of each loan.</P>
              <P>(4) If the loan agreement is signed by someone other than the chief borrowing official, than a Certificate for Signature by an Alternate will be completed. (See appendix D for DA Form 4881-1-R.) It will be attached to the signed (by the borrower) copy of the agreement that is retained by the approving authority. DA Forms 4881-R, 4881-1-R, and 4881-2-R are reproduced locally on 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 11-inch paper.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Surety bonds.</E> (1) Some borrowers of Army materiel must post a surety bond. (See table 2-1 and DA Form 4881-3-R at app E.) Bonds ensure safe return of the borrowed materiel or reimbursement for any loss of or damage to the materiel. The bond will consist of—</P>
              <P>(i) A properly executed surety bond with a certified bank check, cash, or negotiable US Treasury bonds, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Notice of bond by a reputable bonding company deposited with the approving authority for the loan. Bonds will equal the total price of the borrowed items as shown in exhibit I to the loan agreement (app C, DA Form 4881-R). A “double” bond (bond equal to twice the value of the borrowed item(s)) will be required—</P>
              <P>(A) For Army materiel loaned to the Red Cross for instruction and practice to aid the Army, Navy, or Air Force in time of war (10 U.S.C. 2542).</P>
              <P>(B) For ordnance and ordnance stores loaned to high schools in the District of Columbia (10 U.S.C. 4653).</P>
              <P>(2) The bond need not be posted by the borrowing agency itself. The source or originating agency for the bond is immaterial if the bond is valid. For example, to secure a loan, a State may post bond on behalf of a city, county, or other governmental body or authority within the State.</P>
              <P>(3) In an emergency, when posting a bond would delay approval of an urgent loan request and when the total price is less than $1,000, the approval authority may approve the request. The approval is on the condition that the bond be posted within 5 days.</P>
              <P>(4) Bond forfeitures or exceptions to mandatory forfeitures can only be made with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Army. Forfeitures will be based on actual expense incurred. Forfeitures do not release the borrowing agency from returning borrowed materiel or affect ownership. Bonds are normally forfeited under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) Materiel is not returned at the termination of a loan period or when return has been directed by the Army.</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrowing agent refuses to pay for damages or other Army expenses.</P>
              <P>(5) Surety bonds will be held by the approving authority until the loan is terminated and final settlement is made. At that time, the bond will be returned to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(6) If US treasury bonds are posted as surety bond, the borrower must execute a power of attorney (DA Form 4481-4-R, app F). This will enable cashing of the treasury bonds if some forfeiture is required. DA Form 4881-3-R (Surety Bond) and DA Form 4881-4-R (Power of Attorney) will be reproduced locally on 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 11-inch paper.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Loan duration.</E> (1) Loan periods and extensions will be shown in table 2-2.</P>
              <P>(2) Materiel will be loaned only for the number of days needed for the specific purpose for which borrowed. Loan extensions must be justified. The reason(s) why other means or other than Army materiel cannot be used must be included. Approval of loan extensions will be based on the merit of the reasons given.</P>
              <P>(3) Loan extensions authorized beyond 1 year will not be approved unless the lender of the loaned materiel has inspected and inventoried the materiel to insure completeness and serviceability.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Types of DA materiel available for loan.</E> Examples of types of items that may be loaned, and examples of the types of organizations that may borrow Army materiel, are listed in table 2-1. Most loans will be nonexpendable items or expendable items not forecast to be consumed (durable items). Expendable items (e.g., expendability code X) will not be loaned unless approved as an exception.<PRTPAGE P="377"/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Loan requests will be expedited according to the situation's urgency. A situation may be so serious that waiting for instructions or approval from a higher authority is unwarranted. Commanders will then take action as required to save human life, prevent human suffering, or reduce property damage or destruction. (See § 623.2(b)(1).) Such emergency actions will be reported at once to higher authority according to § 623.7.</P>
              <P>(2) Requests to the US Army for loan, or loan extension, will be promptly sent by the Army element that received the request through channels to the approving authority shown in table 2-1 or as specified in appropriate regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) Loan requests will be made by the head of the Federal agency, civil authority, or civilian activity desiring the materiel. An exception is that requests from the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration (FDAA) will normally be initiated by an FDAA regional director rather than by the administrator. The requests should be made directly to the approving authorities shown in table 2-1.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The Army National Guard (ARNG).</E> Loan requests for property belonging to ARNG will be made under National Guard Regulation 735-12. (See para 5, table 2-1.)</P>

              <P>(ii) Approving authority involved will—</P>

              <P>(A) Forward a loan agreement to requester. Loan agreements within DOD will often consist of letter requests, approving endorsements, and materiel issue document (DD 1348-1) transferring temporary accountability. Between units and activities, a hand receipt may be used as the loan agreement.<PRTPAGE P="380"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) Furnish positive identification of item to be loaned.</P>
              <P>(C) Provide instructions for delivery of equipment.</P>
              <P>(iii) DOD recipient of loaned Army materiel will—</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-DOD activities.</E> Non-DOD activities, including Federal agencies will request loan of Army materiel as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Non-DOD activities, and agencies, will send routine requests by letter 45 days before the materiel is required. Federal agencies may use Standard Form 344 (Multiuse Standard Requisitioning/Issue System Document). Requests will include the following:</P>

              <P>(B) Date request is submitted.</P>
              <P>(C) Title of requesting agency and/or person authorized to receive or pick up the borrowed materiel. Be specific; e.g., Special Agent in Charge John Doe, FBI, Anytown, USA, (telephone number with area code) 123-456-7890.</P>
              <P>(D) Type of loan; e.g., Boy Scout National Jamboree, American Legion Convention, etc. (with a short summary of circumstances).</P>
              <P>(E) Statement that none of the requested materiel is internally available to the requesting activity.</P>
              <P>(F) Statement that this support is not reasonably available from local government or commercial sources.</P>

              <P>(J) Proposed duration of the loan.</P>

              <P>(L) If firearms are requested, a statement that adequate facilities are available to secure the arms. See § 623.5(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(M) A statement that the borrowing activity will assume all responsibilities, liabilities, and costs related to the movement, use, care, security, loss, damage, and repair of the loaned materiel.</P>

              <P>(Q) Complete instructions for delivery of the equipment to ensure that shipping instructions in the request are consistent with the urgency of the situation.

              <P>(R) If applicable, the number of persons to be accommodated.</P>
              <P>(ii) Urgent requests may be made to meet expected or actual emergencies. Such requests may be made by telephone or by electrically transmitted message. Include information required in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A) through (R) of this section to the extent possible. The request will be presented to the approving authority. The borrower will then send a complete written request to formalize the emergency request.</P>

              <P>(iii) If approval of the loan is granted, approving authorities will contact accountable property officers at CONUS installations (equivalent level overseas), or MRC item managers to determine which items are available. Installation requests to MRCs will state that the installation resources could not meet the loan requirements. Availability decisions will be based on normal management criteria including <PRTPAGE P="381"/>past and anticipated demand, asset balances, order-ship time, repair rate and repair cycles, and procurement schedules. If requested items are available and approved for issue, the approving authority (or designee) will—</P>
              <P>(A) Negotiate and agreement;</P>
              <P>(B) Obtain surety bond from the borrower when required;</P>
              <P>(C) Provide reproduced copies of the signed documents to the appropriate accountable property office along with authorization to make the loan.</P>
              <P>(iv) Approving authorities will maintain a system of numerical control for all loans. The accountable property officer will enter this number on all transaction documents related to each specific loan to include requisition, issue, shipping, turn-in, and financial documents.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">The US Secret Service (USSS).</E> (i) Army regulation 1-4 provides policies and procedures for Army support to the Secret Service.

              <P>(2) Loaned property will be kept on the accountable records of the owning property account. The entry showing the quantities loaned will be supported by DD Form 1348-1 (receipt document), and copies of the loan agreement and surety bond (if required). The receipt document must be signed by the responsible official of the borrowing activity. It is then returned to the accountable property officer as a valid hand receipt for property accounting purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) Loans will be processed by accountable property officers according to normal supply procedures except as modified by this regulation.</P>

              <P>(4) Accountable property officers will keep loan files with enough documentation to provide an audit trail for loan transactions and a single source of accounting and billing for reimbursement. No separate property book accounts will be set up for these loans. <PRTPAGE P="384"/>Items, with dates shipped, will be identified by use of “loan control numbers” in loan jacket files and in supporting documentation.

To keep the materiel out of unauthorized hands, consignees (receivers) will be advised of the items and quantities to be loaned; the source of supply; whether the items are to be picked up or shipped; and of shipments made.</P>
              <P>(2) All shipments of loaned equipment will be documented on DOD single line item “release or receipt” document (DD Form 1348-1). These will be initiated by the lending accountable property officer. Packing, crating, handling, estimated transportation costs, and serial numbers (if applicable) of items shipped will be shown on all copies. The consignee will be given advance copies of the DD Form 1348-1 as notice of shipment, and a list of DD Form 1348-1 document numbers. For loans to non-DOD activities two copies of the certificate below will be prepared by the accountable property officer (see fig. 1). It will accompany the DD Forms 1348-1.</P>

              <P>(3) One copy of each signed DD Form 1348-1 (for non-DOD activities, one copy of the signed certificate) will be returned to the accountable property officer. Also, one copy of each will be kept in the borrower's file.</P>
              <P>(4) The installation or depot transportation officer is responsible for coordinating movement of the items that must be shipped.</P>
              <P>(5) Shipments, including those to foreign countries, will be made on commercial bills of lading (CBL). Freight charges will be paid by the borrower. The CBL will cite proper project codes. NOTE: In emergencies where use of CBL would delay shipment, government bills of lading (GBL) may be used subject to later reimbursement. Shipments to Boy Scout World Jamborees in foreign countries will be by GBL unless otherwise specified by the Boy Scouts.</P>
              <P>(6) Shipments will be consolidated to the maximum to get the lowest charges available.</P>
              <P>(7) Separate shipping instructions will be provided for each recipient, convention, jamboree, etc., to ensure correct consignee and railhead addresses.</P>
              <P>(8) Transportation will be at no expense to the government. The Defense Transportation Services (Military Sealift Command, Military Airlift Command, and Military Traffic Management Command) will send all billings for such transportation costs to the US Army Finance and Accounting Center (USAFAC). The USAFAC will then bill the fiscal station servicing the accountable property office that made the loan. This fiscal station will then bill the borrower for these transportation costs. Army materiel loaned to non-DOD activities is not authorized for oversea movement on a space available basis by MSC or MAC without their prior approval.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Receipt of borrowed property.</E> (1) The person authorized to receive the materiel (whether shipped or picked <PRTPAGE P="385"/>up) will check the quantities received against the quantities shown on the DD Form 1348-1. This person will also verify the condition of the materiel. Any variation in quantity or condition must be resolved at once. If the shortage or damage is not due to a common carrier, the borrower will give the accountable property officer the National Stock Number, document number, and an explanation of the variation at once. This establishes a basis for assessing charges on termination of the loan. Replacement shipments, when required, will be covered by a DD Form 1348-1. All variations will be noted on the reverse side of the bill of lading.</P>
              <P>(2) When a DD Form 1348-1 has not been received by the borrower and does not accompany the shipment, an informal report will be made to the accountable property officer at once. It will include the nomenclature, quantities, condition, and if applicable, the model numbers and serial number of all material received.</P>
              <P>(3) When shipment has been verified, the borrower (or designee) will enter the quantity received on two copies of the DD Form 1348-1. Serial numbers will also be entered for serial numbered items. The completed copies of the DD Form 1348-1 will be signed by the authorized person. One copy of the DD Form 1348-1 and one copy of the signed certificate (receipt of the materiel) will be returned to the accountable property officer.</P>
              <P>(4) If shipments are received damaged or short, take action described in § 623.4(g).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Accounting by borrower.</E> Non-DOD borrowing activities should maintain a system of jacket files. This should include copies of all documents that authorize the loan of materiel and relate to loan transactions. Such files will insure return of materiel within the approved loan period. Files should be retained for audit or any other purpose as required.

              <P>(iii) Expendable items returned by rifle clubs and institutions will be posted to the accountable record as a debit voucher. The DCM will determine disposition of these items.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Requisition procedures.</E> (i) The DCM will prepare requisitions based on information from the rifle clubs or institutions.

              <P>(iv) The supply source responsible for the loan will ship the materiel directly to the rifle club or school.</P>
              <P>(v) DD Forms 1348-1 received with the shipment or by mail, will be annotated and signed by the person authorized to receive and sign for property for the rifle club or school. The quantity and condition of the items received will be entered thereon. This entry will be based on a physical check and inspection of the materiel. Serial numbers of items received (if applicable and not noted) will also be entered. Two of the completed copies will be signed by the person authorized to sign for the club or institution. They will be mailed to the DCM, HQDA Secretary Field Directorate Marksmanship (SFDM). The third completed copy will be kept in the unit's file.</P>
              <P>(vi) If a DD Form 1348-1 is not received with the shipment or is not received by mail, a receipt letter will be sent to the DCM. It will set forth the nomenclature, quantities, condition, and serial numbers (of serial-numbered items) of all property received. This letter will be sent as soon as possible after receipt of the property. The receipt letter will be used by the DCM as a loan voucher. One copy will be recorded in the voucher register and placed in the voucher file. The loan action will be posted to the DCM stock record account.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Property returns.</E> When property is returned by civilian rifle clubs or institutions, the DCM will prepare seven copies of the DD Form 1348-1.

              <P>(i) Two copies to the consignee (receiving depot, arsenal, or installation). One copy of the DD Form 1348-1 received by the consignee will be used to tally the shipment and to account for property received. The other copy will be signed by the accountable property officer (or representative) and will be sent to the DCM to terminate the open receipt in the loan voucher file.</P>
              <P>(ii) One copy with the shipment.</P>
              <P>(iii) One copy to the DCM, HQDA (SFDM), accompanied by the bill of lading (where available).</P>
              <P>(iv) One copy retained by the rifle club or institution.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Lost, damaged, or destroyed property.</E> Loss, damage, or destruction of property in the possession of a rifle club or institution will be reported within 24 hours by telephone to the DCM (202-693-6460), the local police, and the FBI. All public and local laws must be complied with. Rifles and other equipment (except ammunition) that becomes unserviceable will be reported to the DCM by the club or institution. The DCM will give instructions for return of the equipment without expense to the government. Any equipment damage or loss that is the fault of the club or institution will be determined by a report of survey (AR 735-<PRTPAGE P="390"/>11). The club or institution must then reimburse the DCM. The DCM may replace damaged equipment after reimbursement. Government property lost or destroyed without fault or neglect on the club's part will be replaced, if replacements are available. The club will pay only shipping and handling charges.</P>

              <P>(2) Separate subsidiary general ledger accounts and/or files of documents showing the total value of all issues and materiel returned for credit, and supporting documentation will be set up by the finance and accounting office. The accounts will be kept current for each loan action so reports may be made as prescribed; and so that accounts receivable can be processed for billing and collection action.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination of charges and settlement.</E> (1) Returned materiel will be promptly classified by a qualified inspector with action as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Materiel classified as unserviceable, uneconomically reparable will be billed at 100 percent of value.</P>
              <P>(ii) Materiel classified as unserviceable, economically reparable will be billed for reduced utility (if appropriate) as well as for repair/overhaul costs.</P>
              <P>(iii) The depreciation of borrowed materiel will be determined by technical inspectors according to Army Regulation 735-11. When qualified inspectors are not available, returned property will be received with “condition” shown as “subject to final classification by DA.” Accountable property officers will complete classification promptly so charges and billing can be made within 30 days of return of materiel.</P>
              <P>(2) All returned property which needs repair will be examined by a technical inspector to find cost of repair. Then the accountable property officer will prepare a property transaction record with supporting documents. These records will be sent to the proper MACOM commander or CINC of UCOM for final review. They will include—</P>
              <P>(i) A statement on the transaction record identifying the financial account to which the reimbursement money is to be deposited.</P>

              <P>(ii) A statement on the transaction record (if appropriate) as follows: “The losses and/or damages shown on the <PRTPAGE P="392"/>Property Transaction Record in the amount of $___ represent the total claim by the US Army for property loaned to ________. Upon settlement and deposit to the proper account, lender releases the ________ from further obligations.”</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the type and degree of repair (separate addendum).</P>
              <P>(3) After the final review, an approved list of charges will be sent to the servicing finance office for collection. The property will be released for repair and returned to stock.</P>
              <P>(4) The finance office will send a letter to the borrower requesting payment (payable to the Treasurer of the United States). Upon payment, collection documents will be prepared and fiscal accounts credited. The MACOM or UCOM Surgeon will ensure the stock fund is reimbursed for expendable medical supply losses reported.</P>
              <P>(5) The finance office will advise the loaning accountable property officer that settlement has been made. Property transaction records will be closed.</P>
              <P>(6) The approving authority will then return the bond to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(7) The value of supplies and equipment returned to the Army will be credited to the account originally debited at the time of issue. FDAA Regional Directors may find that it is not in the public interest to return borrowed materiel that has not been consumed, lost, or damaged. They will negotiate with the CONUS Army concerned for proper reimbursement for the borrowed materiel not returned.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Delinquent and uncoolectible accounts.</E> (1) In cases of unsatisfactory settlement, bond proceeds will be used to satisfy the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) If this does not settle the account, then 6 months after the final report and after all collection efforts have failed—</P>
              <P>(i) Servicing finance offices will send delinquent “accounts receivable” reports to commanders of CONUS Armies and DARCOM readiness commands, and to CINCs of UCOMs, by forwarding—</P>
              <P>(A) Duplicate copies of Standard Form 1080 billing documents showing complete accounting classification to which reimbursement is to be credited.</P>
              <P>(B) Duplicate copies of all supporting documents.</P>
              <P>(C) One copy of any correspondence showing the reason(s) for nonpayment of the account.</P>
              <P>(ii) The CONUS Army Commanding General, CINC of UCOM, or Commanding Generals of DARCOM Materiel Readiness Commands, will also try to collect for these delinquent accounts. If all efforts fail, these accounts, (with any delinquent accounts applicable to billings initiated within their own headquarters) will be sent to the Director of Comproller Systems, HQDA (DACA-BUS). (Para 1, app B). The letter of transmittal will state that the accounts are transferred according to this regulation. A copy will be sent to the FAO handling the accounts. The FAO will then transfer the account to inactive status. A Standard Form 1017G (Journal Voucher) will be prepared showing a debit to account 3052 (Transfer of Accounts Receivable) and a credit to the proper accounts receivable.</P>
              <P>(iii) Appropriations available to the accountable property officer or installation will be used for reimbursing; e.g., the Army Stock Fund or Army Industrial Fund accounts. Any later reimbursements received will be credited to the Army appropriation from which payment was made.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon receipt of the accounts included in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Comptroller, HQDA (DACA-BUS), will take further collection action under normal operating procedures. All later collection action is the responsibility of the Comptroller. Accounting records and reports will conform with normal procedures. When further collection effort by the Comptroller fails, these accounts will be dropped from receivable balances of the Army. They will be referred to the General Accounting Office (GAO).</P>

              <P>Pursuant to the authorities, penalties and interpretations cited in the preceding references, Commanders/Directors of field operating agencies may authorize dependents to accompany a Corps of Engineers employee during official travel when using a Government-owned or leased motor vehicle, providing the following procedures and restrictions are adhered to:</P>
              <P>(a) The Commanders/Directors of field operating agencies must make a Determination that transportation of the dependent is in “the interest of the Government”.</P>
              <P>(b) A determination of “the interest of the Government” is a matter of administrative discretion, taking into consideration the following limitations:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of motor vehicles shall be restricted to the “official use” of the vehicles, and any questions concerning “official use” shall be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and policies of this and other pertinent regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) When the travel of the dependent is in “the interest of the Government” and incidentally provides a convenience to the employee, then there can be no objection to the employee's enjoyment of that convenience. However, the convenience of itself, provides no justification to authorize dependent travel.</P>
              <P>(3) Dependent travel will not be provided or authorized when justification is based on reasons of rank or prestige.</P>
              <P>(4) Transportation to, from and between locations for the purpose of conducting personal business or engaging in other activities of a personal nature by military personnel, civilian officials and employees, members of their families or others is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(c) Increased travel time (rest stops) and operational inefficiency (added weight) occasioned by the number of dependents to be transported will also be considered.</P>
              <P>(d) Dependents must understand and agree never to operate the motor vehicle consigned to the employee for official travel.</P>
              <P>(e) Neither the seating capacity nor the size of the motor vehicle will be changed or increased to accommodate dependent travel.</P>
              <P>(f) Motor vehicles as used in this regulation applies to all types of motor vehicles, owned, consigned to or leased by the Corps of Engineers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In view of the potential liability the Government could incur by allowing dependents to accompany an employee in a government-owned, consigned or leased motor vehicle, a Dependent Travel Waiver of Liability will be obtained prior to each and every trip. Suggested language for such waiver is set forth in appendix A.</P>
              <P>(b) When dependents are to be transported in a GSA rented vehicle, an extra signed copy of the Dependent Travel Waiver will be furnished the GSA Interagency Motor Pool from which the vehicle is acquired.</P>
