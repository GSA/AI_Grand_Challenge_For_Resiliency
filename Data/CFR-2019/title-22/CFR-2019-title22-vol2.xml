      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The following regulations implement Executive Order 12356 and provide guidance for members of the public desiring a review for declassification of a document of the Peace Corps.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 301.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Requests for mandatory declassification review.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) All information originally classified by the Peace Corps shall be subject to review for declassification.</P>
          <P>(b) Requests for review of such information for declassification shall be in writing, addressed to the Peace Corps Director of Security, Peace Corps, Washington, DC 20526, and reasonably describe the information sought with sufficient specificity to enable its location with a reasonable amount of effort. Only requests made by a United States citizen or a permanent resident alien, a Federal agency or a State or local government will be considered.</P>
          <P>(c) Requests relating to information, either derivatively classified by the Peace Corps or originally classified by another agency but in the possession of the Peace Corps, shall be forwarded, together with a copy of the record, to the originating agency. The transmittal may contain in Peace Corps recommendation for action.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 301.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Action on requests for declassification review.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Director of Security shall present each request for declassification to the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee, which shall consist of the Associate Director for International Operations, the Associate Director for Management and the General Counsel, or their designees, together with his or her recommendation for action.</P>
          <P>(b) Every effort will be made to complete action on each request within 60 days of receipt thereof.</P>
          <P>(c) Information shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. If the Classification Review Committee determines that the material for which review is requested no longer requires this protection, it shall be declassified and made available to the requester unless withholding is otherwise authorized by law.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee determines that requested information must remain classified, the requester shall be given prompt notice of the decision and, if possible, a brief explanation of why the information cannot be declassified.</P>
          <P>(e) The Peace Corps may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself classified under E.O. 12356.</P>
          <P>(f) A requester may appeal a refusal to declassify information to the Director of the Peace Corps, or the Director's designee. Appeals shall be in writing, addressed to the Director of the Peace Corps, Washington, DC 20526, and shall briefly state the reasons why the requester believes that the Peace Corps Classification Review Committee decision is in error. Appeals must be submitted within 30 days after receipt of notice of the Classification Review Committee decision. The decision of the Peace Corps Director, or designee, will be based on the entire record, and will be rendered in writing within 60 days after receipt of an appeal. The decision of the Director or Director's designee is the final Peace Corps action on a request.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>This part sets out the rules and procedures the Peace Corps follows in making records available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 303.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in this part—</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester has made a commercial use request, the Peace Corps will look to the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. When the Peace Corps has reasonable cause to doubt the requester's stated use of the records sought, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, it will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a category.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a record requested pursuant to this part. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable electronic documents, among others.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or an institution of professional or vocational education which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing</E> means the process set forth in the FOIA that allows requesters to ask for expedited processing of their FOIA request if they can demonstrate a compelling need.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Fee waiver</E> means the waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">FOIA Public Liaison</E> means an agency official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">OIG records</E> means those records as defined generally in this section which originated with or are in the possession and control of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Peace Corps which have been compiled for law enforcement, audit, and investigative functions and/or any other purpose authorized under the IG Act of 1978, as amended.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Records</E> means books, papers, maps, photographs, or other documentary materials, regardless of whether the format is physical or electronic, made or received by the Peace Corps in connection with the transaction of Peace Corps' business and preserved by the Peace Corps as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Peace Corps, or because of the informational value of data in them. The term does not include, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> books, magazines, or other materials acquired solely for library purpose, or that are otherwise publicly available.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized <PRTPAGE P="7"/>and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of “freelance” journalists, they will be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Requester category</E> means one of the three categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication, including commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.</P>
          <P>(l) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining a document located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of such document is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any such document for disclosure. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
          <P>(m) <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records that are responsive to a request for records. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. Searches may be conducted manually or by automated means and will be conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner. If the Agency cannot identify the requested records after a 2 hour search, it can determine that the records were not adequately described and ask the requester to provide a more specific request.</P>
          <P>(n) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity providing potentially confidential commercial information to an agency, which information may be subject to a FOIA request. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to, individuals, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Peace Corps will make its records concerning its operations, activities, and business available to the public consistent with the requirements of the FOIA. As a matter of policy, the Peace Corps makes discretionary disclosures of records or information that may be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Records published in the Federal Register.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The Peace Corps publishes its notices and substantive regulations in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> It also publishes information on its basic structure and operations necessary to inform the public how to deal effectively with the Peace Corps in the <E T="03">United States Government Manual,</E> a special publication of the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Peace Corps will make reasonable efforts to currently update such information, which includes information on Peace Corps' location and functions, and how the public may obtain information or forms, or make submittals or requests. The Peace Corps' published regulations are at 22 CFR Chapter III.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 303.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Public reading room.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The Peace Corps maintains a public reading room at its headquarters at 1111 20th Street NW., Washington DC 20526. This room is supervised and is open to the public during Peace Corps' regular business hours for inspecting <PRTPAGE P="8"/>and copying records described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) Subject to the limitation stated in paragraph (c) of this section, the Peace Corps makes the following records available in the public reading room:</P>
          <P>(1) All final public opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, and orders issued in the adjudication of cases that involve the Peace Corps;</P>

          <P>(2) Statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the Peace Corps that are not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
          <P>(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to the staff that affect the public;</P>
          <P>(4) Copies of records, regardless of form or format, released to any person in response to a public request for records which the Peace Corps determines are likely to become subject to subsequent requests for substantially the same records, and a general index of such records;</P>
          <P>(5) The index required by § 303.7; and</P>
          <P>(6) Other records the Peace Corps has determined are of general interest to members of the public in understanding activities of the Peace Corps or in dealing with the Peace Corps in connection with those activities.</P>
          <P>(c) Certain records otherwise required by FOIA to be available in the public reading room may be exempt from mandatory disclosure pursuant to § 552(b) of the FOIA. Such record will not be made available in the public reading room. Other records maintained in the public reading room may be edited by the deletion of identifying details concerning individuals to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In such cases, the record shall have attached to it an explanation of the deletion. The extent of the deletion shall be indicated, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption under which the deletion is made. It technically feasible, the extent of the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion was made.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Electronic reading room.</E> Records required by the FOIA to be maintained and made available in the public reading room created by the Peace Corps on or after November 1, 1996, are made available electronically on the Peace Corps Web site at <E T="03">http://www.peacecorps.gov.</E>

          <SUBJECT>Procedures for use of public reading room.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Any member of the public may inspect or copy records described in § 303.5(b) in the public reading room during regular business hours. Because it will sometimes be impossible to produce records or copies of records on short notice, a person who wishes to inspect or copy records shall arrange a time in advance, by telephone or letter request made to the Peace Corps FOIA Officer. Persons submitting a request by telephone for a record in the public reading room will be notified whether a written request would be advisable to aid in the identification and expeditious processing of the records sought. Written requests should identify the records sought in the manner described in § 303.8(b) and should request a specific date for inspecting the records. The requester will be advised as promptly as possible if, for any reason, it may not be possible to make the records sought available on the date requested.</P>

          <P>The Peace Corps will maintain a current index identifying any matter within the scope of § 303.4 or § 303.5(b)(1) through (5). The index will be maintained and made available for public inspection and copying at the Peace Corps' headquarters in Washington, DC. The cost of a copy of the index will not exceed the standard charge for duplication set out in § 303.13(e). The Peace Corps will also make the index available on its public Web site.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 303.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Requests for records.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Except for records required by the FOIA to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or to be made available in the public reading room, the Peace Corps will make its records promptly available, upon request, to any person in accordance with this section, unless it is determined that such records <PRTPAGE P="9"/>should be withheld and are exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests.</E> Requests for records under this section shall be made in writing via regular mail, email, facsimile, or online web portal and, as applicable, the envelope and the letter or other form of request should be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Request.” All requests shall be addressed to the FOIA Officer. Requests by letter shall use the address given in § 303.5(a). Requests by email must be sent to the FOIA electronic mailbox, <E T="03">foia@peacecorps.gov.</E> Regarding requests submitted via online web portal (accessible on the agency Web site, <E T="03">www.peacecorps.gov</E>), requesters shall fill in all of the fields as required. Any request not marked and addressed as specified in this paragraph will be so marked by Peace Corps personnel as soon as the request is properly identified. The request will be forwarded immediately to the FOIA Officer. A request improperly addressed will not be deemed to have been received for purposes of the time period set out in paragraph (h) of this section until it has been received by the FOIA Officer. Upon receipt of an improperly addressed request, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of the date on which the time period began. Requests by letter shall be stamped “received” on the date received by the FOIA Office. Requests by email shall be “received” on the date the email arrived, if a business day, or on the next business day. Requests by online web portal will be entered automatically in the FOIA tracking system. Requests sent via mail or email will be entered manually in the FOIA tracking system. Requesters may utilize the online web portal for purpose of checking status of requests (open/closed) for requests from all sources.</P>
          <P>(c) A request must reasonably describe the records requested so that employees of the Peace Corps who are familiar with the subject area of the request are able, with a reasonable amount of effort, to determine which particular records are within the scope of the request. If it is determined that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the requester shall be so informed and provided an opportunity to confer with Peace Corps personnel in order to attempt to reformulate the request in a manner that will meet the needs of the requester and the requirements of this paragraph (c). If the Agency cannot identify the requested records after a 2 hour search, it may determine that the records were not adequately described and ask the requester to provide a more specific request.</P>
          <P>(d) To facilitate the location of records by the Peace Corps, a requester should try to provide the following kinds of information, if known;</P>
          <P>(1) The specific event or action to which the record refers;</P>
          <P>(2) The unit or program of the Peace Corps which may be responsible for or may have produced the record;</P>
          <P>(3) The date of the record or the date or period to which it refers or relates;</P>
          <P>(4) The type of record, such as an application, a particular form, a contract, or a report;</P>
          <P>(5) Personnel of the Peace Corps who may have prepared or have knowledge of the record; or</P>
          <P>(6) Citations to newspapers or publications which have referred to the record.</P>
          <P>(e) The Peace Corps is not required to create a record or to perform research to satisfy a request.</P>
          <P>(f) Any request for a waiver or reduction of fees should be included in the FOIA request, and any such request should indicate the grounds for a waiver or reduction of fees, as set out in § 303.13(f). The Peace Corps shall respond to such request as promptly as possible.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Format.</E> The Peace Corps will provide records in the form or format indicated by the requester to the extent such records are readily reproducible in the requested form or format.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Initial response/delays.</E> (1) The FOIA Officer, upon request for any records made in accordance with this section, except in the case of a request for OIG records, shall assign a tracking number to each individual request and send an acknowledgement letter or email to each requester. The acknowledgement letter or email will inform the requester of the assigned tracking number. The FOIA Officer will make an <PRTPAGE P="10"/>initial determination of whether to comply with or deny such request and dispatch such determination to the requester within 20 business days after receipt of such request. Peace Corps will acknowledge all FOIA requests within 20 working days, except for unusual circumstances, in which case the time limit may be extended for up to 10 business days by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.</P>
          <P>(2) If the FOIA Officer determines that a request or portion thereof is for OIG records, the FOIA Officer shall promptly refer the request or portion thereof to the OIG and send notice of such referral to the requester. In such case, the OIG FOIA Officer shall make an initial determination of whether to comply with or deny such request and dispatch such determination to the requester within 20 business days after receipt of such request, except for unusual circumstances, in which case the time limit may be extended for up to 10 business days by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. If for any reason, a request for Agency information goes directly to the OIG rather than through the FOIA Officer, the OIG shall provide notice to the FOIA Officer of its receipt of the request. The FOIA Office and the OIG should normally consult with each other whenever they receive requests for the same or similar records.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> As used in this part, “unusual circumstances” are limited to the following, but only to the extent reasonably necessary for the proper processing of the particular request:</P>
          <P>(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from components or locations that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
          <P>(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>

          <P>(i) If a request is particularly broad or complex so that it cannot be completed within the time periods stated in paragraph (h) of this section, the Peace Corps may ask the requester to narrow the request or agree to an additional delay.</P>
          <P>(j) When no determination can be dispatched within the applicable time limit, the FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and the requester's right to treat the delay as a denial and to appeal to the Associate Director for the Office of Management or the Inspector General, in accordance with § 303.12. If no determination has been dispatched by the end of the 20-day period, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem the request denied, and exercise a right of appeal in accordance with § 303.12. The FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer may ask the requester to forego an appeal until a determination is made.</P>
          <P>(k) After it has been determined that a request will be granted, the responsible official will act with due diligence in providing a prompt response.</P>
          <P>(l) <E T="03">Expedited treatment.</E> (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever the requester demonstrates a compelling need. A compelling need means:</P>
          <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
          <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Peace Corps or Federal government activity and the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
          <P>(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or</P>

          <P>(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the Peace Corps' or the Federal government's integrity which affect public confidence.<PRTPAGE P="11"/>

          <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement demonstrating a compelling need that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>
          <P>(4) Within ten business days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, the FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer shall decide whether to grant the request and shall notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously by the Peace Corps.</P>
          <P>(5) Appeals shall be made to the Associate Director for the Office of Management, who shall respond within 10 business days of receipt of the appeal.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Exemptions for withholding records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Peace Corps may withhold a requested record from public disclosure only if the record fits within one or more of the following FOIA exemptions:</P>
          <P>(1) Matter specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and is in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;</P>
          <P>(2) Matter which is related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Peace Corps;</P>
          <P>(3) Matter which is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than exemptions under FOIA at 5 U.S.C. 552(b)), provided that such statute requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or establishes particular criteria for withholding, or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
          <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
          <P>(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Peace Corps;</P>
          <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes including enforcing the Peace Corps Act or any other law, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
          <P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
          <P>(ii) Would deprive a person or a recipient of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
          <P>(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis; and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
          <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</P>

          <P>(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or<PRTPAGE P="12"/>
          </P>

          <P>(b) In the event that one or more of the above exemptions in paragraph (a) of this section apply, any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to the requester after deletion of the portions that are exempt. The Peace Corps shall indicate, if technically feasible, the precise amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made at the place in the record where the deletion is made, and indicate the exemption under which a deletion is made on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption. At the discretion of the Peace Corps officials authorized to grant or deny a request for records, it may be possible to provide a requester with:</P>
          <P>(1) A summary of information in the exempt portion of a record; or</P>
          <P>(2) An oral description of the exempt portion of a record.</P>
          <P>(c) No requester shall have a right to insist that any or all of the techniques in paragraph (b) of this section should be employed in order to satisfy a request.</P>
          <P>(d) Records that may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be made available at the discretion of the Peace Corps.</P>
          <P>(e) Proprietary information. (1) It is the policy of the Peace Corps to withhold proprietary information that falls within the protection of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Proprietary information includes trade secrets, or commercial or financial information obtained from a person, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</P>
          <P>(2) It is also the policy of the Peace Corps to give submitters of arguably proprietary information an adequate opportunity to provide information to the Peace Corps to establish that the information constitutes protected proprietary information.</P>
          <P>(3) A person submitting arguably proprietary information to the Peace Corps will be notified in writing by the Peace Corps if there is a FOIA request for the information, unless:</P>
          <P>(i) The Peace Corps has already decided that the information should be withheld;</P>
          <P>(ii) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law.</P>
          <P>(4) The notice shall afford the submitter at least ten business days in which to object to the disclosure of any requested information. Whenever the Peace Corps provides such notice to the submitter, it shall also notify the requester that notice and an opportunity to comment are being provided to the submitter.</P>
          <P>(5) A submitter's request for protection for information under paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall:</P>
          <P>(i) Specifically identify the exact material claimed to be confidential proprietary information;</P>
          <P>(ii) State whether the information identified has ever been released to a person who is not in a confidential relationship with the submitter;</P>
          <P>(iii) State the basis for the submitter's belief that the information is not commonly known or readily ascertainable by outside persons; and</P>
          <P>(iv) State how release of the information would cause harm to the submitter's competitive position.</P>
          <P>(6) The Peace Corps shall consider the submitter's objections and specific grounds for non-disclosure when deciding whether to disclose the information. If the Peace Corps decides to disclose the information, it shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the submitter at least ten business days notice of its decision before the information is disclosed and a statement of its reasons for not sustaining the objection to disclosure. Whenever the Peace Corps notifies the submitter of its final decision, it shall also notify the requester.</P>
          <P>(7) Whenever a FOIA requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of proprietary information, the Peace Corps shall promptly notify the submitter.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Legal counsel.</E> The General Counsel (GC) shall furnish legal advice to Peace Corps officials and staff as to their obligations under this part and shall take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to assure a consistent and equitable application of the provisions of this part by and within the Peace Corps. The OIG Legal Counsel will coordinate with GC, as appropriate and necessary, when furnishing legal advice to the OIG FOIA Officer and Inspector General.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny requests for records, except for OIG records, under this part. The OIG FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny requests for OIG records under this part. The FOIA Officer and the OIG FOIA Officer shall consult with each other when a request includes both Peace Corps and OIG records in order to ensure consistency and lack of duplication in processing the request.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Records received from other agencies.</E> When the Peace Corps receives a request for a record in its possession that it has received from another agency, it shall determine whether the other agency is better qualified to decide whether the record is exempt from disclosure and, if so, whether it should be disclosed as a matter of discretion. If the Peace Corps determines it is better qualified to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the Peace Corps determines it is not better qualified to process the request, it shall either:</P>
          <P>(i) Consult with the other agency before responding to the request; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request for the record to the other agency (but only if the agency is subject to FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Law enforcement and classified information.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</P>
          <P>(i) Whenever the Peace Corps receives a request for a record containing information that relates to an investigation of a possible violation of law that was originated by another agency, the Peace Corps will either consult with the other agency before responding or refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the other agency; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whenever a request is made for a record containing information that has been classified by another agency or may be appropriate for classification under Executive Order 13525 or any other executive order concerning the classification of records, the Peace Corps shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, should consider the information for classification, or has the primary interest in the information, as appropriate.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> Whenever the Peace Corps refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of the agency to which the request has been referred and the part of the request that has been referred and provide the requester with a point of contact within the receiving agency to whom the requester can speak regarding the referral.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Effect of consultations and referrals on timing of response.</E> All consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date the FOIA request was initially received by the Peace Corps.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Agreements with other agencies.</E> The Peace Corps may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.</P>

          <P>(a) Any person whose written request has been denied is entitled to appeal the denial within 30 business days by writing to the Associate Director of the Office of Management or, in the case of a denial of a request for OIG Records, the Inspector General, at the address given in 303.5(a). An appeal need not be in any particular form, but should adequately identify the denial, if possible, by describing the requested record, identifying the official who issued the denial, and providing the date on which the denial was issued. If the appeal is sent via mail, the envelope and the letter should be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Appeal” and the appeal shall be addressed to the Associate Director, Office of Management. Appeals by letter shall use the address given in § 303.5(a). Appeals are accepted via email. Appeals by email must be sent to the FOIA electronic mailbox, <E T="03">foia@peacecorps.gov.</E> In appeals submitted via online web portal (accessible on the agency Web site, <E T="03">www.peacecorps.gov</E>), requesters shall fill in all of the fields as required. Appeals by online web portal will be entered automatically in the FOIA tracking system. Persons submitting an appeal may utilize the online web portal for purpose of checking status of requests (open/closed) for requests from all sources.</P>

          <P>(b) A response to an appeal will advise the requester that the 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. A requester may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:

The decision shall be dispatched to the requester within 20 business days after receipt of the appeal, unless an additional period is justified pursuant to § 303.8(i) and such period taken together with any earlier extension does not exceed 10 business days.

          <P>(b) For each commercial use request, fees will be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search, review, and duplication.</P>

          <P>(c) For each request for records sought by a representative of the news media or by an educational or non-commercial scientific institution, fees <PRTPAGE P="15"/>shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication after the first 100 pages.</P>
          <P>(d) For all other requests, fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for search time after the first 2 hours and duplication after the first 100 pages.</P>
          <P>(e) The schedule of reasonable standard charges for services regarding the production or disclosure of the Peace Corps records is as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) Manual search and review of records: Salary rate of employee[s] performing the search and review plus 16%. Charges for search and review time less than a full hour will be billed by quarter-hour segments;</P>
          <P>(2) Computer time: Actual costs as incurred;</P>
          <P>(3) Duplication by paper copy: 15 cents per page;</P>
          <P>(4) Duplication by other methods: Actual costs as incurred;</P>
          <P>(5) Certification of true copies: $1.00 each;</P>
          <P>(6) Packing and mailing records: Actual costs as incurred; and</P>
          <P>(7) Special delivery or express mail: Actual charges as incurred.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Fee waivers:</E> Fees will be waived or reduced below the fees established under paragraph (e) of this section if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Peace Corps or Federal government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
          <P>(1) In order to determine whether the disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Federal government, the Peace Corps shall consider the following four criteria:</P>
          <P>(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Peace Corps or Federal government;</P>
          <P>(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of Peace Corps or Federal government operations or activities;</P>
          <P>(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding;” and</P>
          <P>(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of Peace Corps or Federal government operations or activities.</P>
          <P>(2) In order to determine whether disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Peace Corps shall consider the following two factors:</P>
          <P>(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and if so,</P>
          <P>(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”</P>
          <P>(3) These fee waiver/reduction provisions will be subject to appeal in the same manner as appeals from denial under § 303.12.</P>
          <P>(g) No fee will be charged under this section unless the cost of routine collection and processing of the fee payment is likely to exceed the average cost of processing a payment.</P>
          <P>(h) Requesters must agree to pay all fees charged for services associated with their requests. The Peace Corps will assume that requesters agree to pay all charges for services associated with their requests up to $25 unless otherwise indicated by the requester.</P>
          <P>(i) No requester will be required to make an advance payment of any fee unless:</P>

          <P>(1) The requester has previously failed to pay a required fee to another federal agency or to Peace Corps within 30 days of the date of billing, in which case an advance deposit of the full amount of the anticipated fee together with the fee then due plus interest accrued may be required. (The request will not be deemed to have been <PRTPAGE P="16"/>received by the Peace Corps until such payment is made.); or</P>
          <P>(2) The Peace Corps determines that an estimated fee will exceed $250, in which case the requester shall be notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. Such notification shall be transmitted as soon as possible, but in any event within 5 business days of receipt of the request by the Peace Corps. The notification shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with appropriate representatives of the Peace Corps for the purpose of reformulating the request so as to meet the needs of the requester at a reduced cost. The request will not be deemed to have been received by the Peace Corps for purposes of the initial 20-day response period until the requester makes a deposit on the fee in an amount determined by the Peace Corps.</P>
          <P>(j) Interest may be charged to those requesters who fail to pay the fees charged. Interest will be assessed on the amount billed, starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The rate charged will be as prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
          <P>(k) The Agency is not required to process a request for a requester who has not paid FOIA fees owed to another Federal agency.</P>
          <P>(l) If the Peace Corps reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Peace Corps shall aggregate such requests and charge accordingly. Likewise, the Peace Corps will aggregate multiple requests for documents received from the same requester within 45 business days.</P>
          <P>(m) The Peace Corps reserves the right to limit the number of copies of any document that will be provided to any one requester or to require that special arrangements for duplication be made in the case of bound volumes or other records representing unusual problems of handling or reproduction.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure in the event of a demand for production or disclosure.</E> (1) No employee or former employee of the Agency shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority set forth in § 303.14(a) produce any material, disclose any information or appear in any proceeding, described in § 303.14(a) without the approval of the General Counsel or designee.</P>
          <P>(2) Whenever an employee or former employee of the Peace Corps receives a demand for the production of material or the disclosure of information described in § 303.14(a) he shall immediately notify and provide a copy of the demand to the General Counsel or designee. The General Counsel, or designee, shall be furnished by the party causing the demand to be issued or served a written summary of the information sought, its relevance to the proceeding in connection with which it was served and why the information sought is unavailable by any other means or from any other sources.</P>
          <P>(3) The General Counsel, or designee, in consultation with appropriate Agency officials, including the Agency's FOIA Officer, or designee, and in light of the considerations listed in § 303.14(d), will determine whether the person on whom the demand was served should respond to the demand.</P>
          <P>(4) To the extent he deems it necessary or appropriate, the General Counsel or designee, may also require from the party causing such demand to be issued or served a plan of all reasonably foreseeable demands, including but not limited to names of all employees and former employees from whom discovery will be sought, areas of inquiry, length of time of proceedings requiring oral testimony and identification of documents to be used or whose production is sought.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Considerations in determining whether production or disclosure should be made pursuant to a demand.</E> (1) In deciding whether to make disclosures pursuant to a demand, the General Counsel or designee, may consider, among things:</P>
          <P>(i) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege.</P>
          <P>(2) Among the demands in response to which disclosure will not be made are those demands with respect to which any of the following factors exist:</P>
          <P>(i) Disclosure would violate a statute or a rule of procedure;</P>
          <P>(ii) Disclosure would violate the privacy rights of an individual;</P>
          <P>(iii) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation;</P>
          <P>(iv) Disclosure would reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified by the originating agency;</P>
          <P>(v) Disclosure would reveal trade secrets or proprietary information without the owner's consent;</P>
          <P>(vi) Disclosure would otherwise adversely affect the interests of the United States or the Peace Corps; or</P>
          <P>(vii) Disclosure would impair an ongoing Inspector General or Department of Justice investigation.</P>

          <P>(6) <E T="03">Family member</E> means any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the applicant or Volunteer is the equivalent of a family relationship.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Selection.</E> Invitations to serve in the Peace Corps are the result of a highly competitive application process. Many more individuals apply for Peace Corps Volunteer service than can be accepted. Because the Peace Corps cannot accept all eligible and qualified applicants who wish to serve, it evaluates applicants to select the best qualified among eligible applicants. The Peace <PRTPAGE P="22"/>Corps determines Applicants' eligibility, and assesses their relative skills, qualifications, and personal attributes, such as motivation, aptitude, fitness for service, emotional maturity, adaptability, productive competence, and ability to serve effectively as a Volunteer in a foreign country and culture.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Under section 5(a) of the Peace Corps Act, 22 U.S.C. 2504(a), the President may enroll in the Peace Corps for service abroad qualified citizens and nationals of the United States. The terms and conditions of the enrollment of Volunteers are exclusively those set forth in the Peace Corps Act and those consistent therewith which the President may prescribe. The President has delegated his authority under section 5(a) of the Peace Corps Act to the Director of the Peace Corps pursuant to Executive Order 12137 (May 16, 1979), as amended.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Non-discrimination.</E> The Peace Corps does not discriminate against any person on account of race, color, religion, sex (including but not limited to gender identity and gender expression), national origin, age (40 and over), disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, marital status, parental status, political affiliation, union membership, genetic information, or history of participation in the EEO process, any grievance procedure or any authorized complaint procedure. Anyone who feels he or she has been discriminated against should contact the Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, 202.692.2139, <E T="03">ocrd@peacecorps.gov,</E> Peace Corps, 1111 20th Street NW., Washington, DC 20526.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to disclose requested information.</E> In order for the Peace Corps to be able to make appropriate selection and placement decisions, it is critical that Applicants provide complete and accurate information throughout the application process, including information provided for a mandatory background investigation. The Peace Corps may disqualify an Applicant or separate a Volunteer or Trainee from Peace Corps service at any time if the Peace Corps determines that the Applicant, Volunteer, or Trainee provided materially false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete information during the Peace Corps application process.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Selection standards.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> To qualify for selection for overseas service as a Volunteer, an Applicant must demonstrate that he or she is suitable, possessing the requisite personal and professional attributes required for Peace Corps service generally, and for the particular Volunteer assignment for which he or she is considered. The Peace Corps assesses each Applicant's personal, professional, educational, and legal qualifications in order to select those Applicants most likely to be successful in a Peace Corps assignment, serving under conditions of hardship if necessary to achieve the goals of the Peace Corps. Meeting these qualifications does not in and of itself entitle any individual to serve in the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps endeavors to select the best qualified individuals from among all eligible Applicants.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Personal attributes.</E> Applicants must adequately demonstrate the following personal attributes to Peace Corps:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Motivation.</E> A sincere desire to carry out the goals of Peace Corps service, and a commitment to serve a full term as a Volunteer.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Productive competence.</E> The intelligence and professional experience or educational background to meet the needs of the individual's assignment.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Emotional maturity and adaptability.</E> The maturity, flexibility, cultural sensitivity, and self-sufficiency to adapt successfully to life in another culture, and to interact and communicate with other people regardless of cultural, social, and economic differences.<PRTPAGE P="23"/>
          </P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Skills.</E> In addition to any educational, professional or other qualifications and prerequisites that an individual must possess in order to be selected for a given assignment, a Trainee must demonstrate competence in the following areas by the end of pre-service training:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Language.</E> The ability to communicate effectively in the appropriate language or languages of the country of service with the fluency required to meet the needs of the overseas assignment.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Technical competence.</E> Proficiency in the technical skills needed to carry out the Trainee's assignment as a Volunteer.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Knowledge.</E> Adequate knowledge of the culture and history of the country of assignment to ensure a successful adjustment to, and acceptance by, the host country society, as well as an appropriate understanding of the history and government of the United States which qualifies the individual to represent the United States abroad.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to meet standards.</E> Failure to meet initial selection standards, failure to attain any of the selection standards by the completion of training, or failure to maintain these standards during service, may be grounds for de-selection and disqualification from Peace Corps service.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Medical status eligibility standard.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> Under the Peace Corps Act (22 U.S.C. 2504(e)), the Peace Corps is responsible for ensuring that Peace Corps Volunteers receive all necessary or appropriate health care during their service. To ensure that the Peace Corps will be capable of doing so, Applicants must be medically qualified for Peace Corps Volunteer service. An Applicant who is otherwise qualified must meet the following requirements:</P>
          <P>(1) The Applicant, with or without reasonable accommodation, removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids or services, must have the physical and mental capacity required to meet the essential eligibility requirements for a Volunteer. In this context, the essential eligibility requirements for a Volunteer include, without limitation, the capability to:</P>
          <P>(i) Live and work independently in an isolated location overseas at the same socio-economic level and in similar conditions as members of the community to which the Applicant is assigned;</P>
          <P>(ii) Perform the job to which the Applicant is assigned; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Complete a specified tour of service without undue disruption.</P>
          <P>(2) The Peace Corps must be capable of providing the Applicant with such health care as the Peace Corps deems to be necessary or appropriate.</P>
          <P>(3) The Applicant must not pose a direct threat (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Individualized assessment.</E> In determining whether an Applicant is medically qualified, an individualized assessment is required regarding each of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Direct threat.</E> (1) A “direct threat” is a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation to policies, practices or procedures, removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids or services.</P>
          <P>(2) In determining whether an applicant poses a direct threat, the Peace Corps will make an individualized assessment based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain:</P>
          <P>(i) The nature, duration and severity of the risk;</P>
          <P>(ii) The probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether reasonable accommodations, removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Reasonable accommodation.</E> (1) The term “accommodation” means modifications to the Peace Corps' policies, practices or procedures.</P>
          <P>(2) An accommodation is not reasonable if:</P>

          <P>(i) It would modify the essential eligibility requirements for a Volunteer;<PRTPAGE P="24"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) It would modify, among other things, the Applicant's Volunteer assignment or the Peace Corps' medical program in a way that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service, program, or activity; or</P>
          <P>(iii) It would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the operations of the Peace Corps, including its medical program.</P>
          <P>(3) In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the operations of the Peace Corps, the Peace Corps may take into account, among other things:</P>
          <P>(i) The size and composition of the Peace Corps staff at the post of assignment;</P>
          <P>(ii) The adequacy of local medical facilities and the availability of other medical facilities;</P>
          <P>(iii) The nature and cost of the accommodation compared to the overall number of Volunteers and the overall size of the Peace Corps budget; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The capacities of the host country agency and of the host community to which the Applicant would be assigned.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Medical status eligibility review.</E> (1) An Applicant who is determined by medical screening staff not to be medically qualified for Peace Corps Volunteer service may request review of that decision by submitting any relevant information to the Office of Medical Services (OMS). The information submitted by the Applicant will be reviewed by a physician, and, unless the physician determines that the Applicant is medically qualified, by a Pre-Service Review Board (PSRB) composed of medical personnel in OMS and advised by the General Counsel. Procedures for such review are subject to approval by the General Counsel.</P>
          <P>(2) The PSRB will include as voting members at least one physician as well as other medical professionals in OMS. In any case involving review of issues involving mental health, at least one mental health professional from the Counseling and Outreach Unit will also participate as a voting member.</P>
          <P>(3) The decision of the PSRB will be reviewed by the General Counsel for legal sufficiency. Subject to that review, it will constitute the final agency action.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Legal status eligibility standard.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> The existence of an arrest or conviction record may, but will not automatically, exclude an Applicant from consideration for Peace Corps service. The Peace Corps will consider the nature of the offense, how long ago the offense occurred, whether the Applicant was acquitted of the offense, the terms of any applicable parole or probation, and other relevant facts or indications of rehabilitation.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Drug and alcohol related offenses.</E> (1) An Applicant with any drug-related conviction, with a conviction for public intoxication, driving under the influence (DUI), or driving while intoxicated (DWI), with a conviction for reckless driving after having been initially charged with DUI or DWI, or with a similar alcohol-related conviction, is not eligible to have his or her application for Peace Corps service considered until 12 months has passed from the date of the incident.</P>
          <P>(2) An Applicant who, at any time on or prior to the day of departure for Peace Corps service, is arrested for any drug offense or for public intoxication, DUI, DWI or any similar alcohol-related offense will have any pending application or invitation for Peace Corps service withdrawn. If the charges are dismissed, an Applicant whose application or invitation for Peace Corps service was terminated may immediately reapply. If the applicant is convicted of the offense, he or she may reapply after 12 months from the date of the incident.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Review process.</E> An Applicant who is rejected for a Volunteer position because of an arrest or conviction may request a review of that decision by submitting any relevant information to the Associate Director of the Office of Volunteer Recruitment and Selection (VRS). The Associate Director will review the information submitted and consult with the General Counsel. The decision of the Associate Director will be the final agency decision. The Associate Director may delegate authority to conduct such a review to another <PRTPAGE P="25"/>senior member of VRS, but not to the supervisor of the office making the original eligibility determination.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Subsequent application.</E> An Applicant rejected for service due to failure to meet the legal status eligibility standard may reapply at a later date, but not sooner than 12 months after the final agency decision.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 305.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Applicants with an intelligence background.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> It has been the longstanding policy of the Peace Corps to exclude from Volunteer service any individuals who have engaged in intelligence activity or related work or who have been employed by or connected with an intelligence agency, either for a specific period of time or permanently (depending on the agency). This policy is founded on the premise that it is crucial to the Peace Corps in carrying out its mission that there be a complete and total separation of Peace Corps from the intelligence activities of the United States Government or any foreign government, both in reality and appearance. Any semblance of a connection between the Peace Corps and the intelligence community would seriously compromise the ability of the Peace Corps to develop and maintain the trust and confidence of the people of the host countries. To ensure that there is not the slightest basis for the appearance of any connection between the Peace Corps and the intelligence community, this policy contains certain temporary and permanent bars to Peace Corps service. Serious doubts about an Applicant's connection with intelligence activities are to be resolved in favor of exclusion.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Intelligence activity</E> includes any activities or specialized training involving or related to the clandestine collection of information, or the analysis or dissemination of such information, intended for use by the United States Government or any foreign government in formulating or implementing political or military policy in regard to other countries. The term “intelligence activity” includes any involvement in covert actions designed to influence events in foreign countries. The fact that the name of an employer or the description of a person's work uses or does not use the term “intelligence” does not, in and of itself, mean that the person has or has not engaged in intelligence activity or related work.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Intelligence agency</E> includes:</P>
          <P>(i) Any agency, division of an agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government that is a member of the United States Intelligence Community; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Any other agency, division of an agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government or any foreign government, a substantial part of whose mission has been determined by the General Counsel to include intelligence activities.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Employment, employee or employed</E> refer to the existence of a relationship of employer and employee, whether full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary, whether or not the individual is engaged in intelligence activity for an employer, without regard to the length of time the relationship existed or is proposed to exist, and includes individuals performing duties as volunteers, fellows, interns, consultants, personal services contractors, contractors (non-personal services contractors), and employees of contractors who were assigned to work for an intelligence agency or to engage in intelligence activities. Employees of contractors who were or are not themselves assigned to work for an Intelligence Agency or to engage in intelligence activities are not considered to have been or to be employed by an intelligence agency.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment by an intelligence agency or engagement in intelligence activities.</E> (1) An Applicant currently or formerly employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is permanently ineligible for Peace Corps Volunteer service.</P>

          <P>(2) An Applicant who has been employed by an intelligence agency other than the CIA is ineligible for a minimum of 10 years from the last day of employment by such intelligence agency. This bar on an Applicant who is or was employed by an intelligence agency applies whether or not the Applicant was engaged in intelligence activity for the intelligence agency.<PRTPAGE P="26"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) An Applicant who has been engaged in intelligence activities is ineligible for service as a Volunteer for a period of 10 years from the last date on which the Applicant engaged in intelligence activities.</P>
          <P>(4) An Applicant may be ineligible for service for a period in excess of 10 years if the General Counsel determines that the Applicant's background or work history with regard to intelligence activities warrants such action.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Relationship to intelligence agency or activity.</E> (1) An Applicant whose background discloses a relationship to an intelligence agency or intelligence activity may be ineligible to serve as a Peace Corps Volunteer. The term “relationship” means any association with an intelligence agency or with an intelligence activity, if such association could be the basis for an inference or the appearance that an Applicant was engaged in an intelligence activity. The association could include, but not be limited to, one based upon a familial, personal or financial connection to an intelligence agency or with an intelligence activity.</P>
          <P>(2) Determinations of the eligibility or periods of ineligibility of such Applicants will be made by the General Counsel on a case by case basis using the criteria set forth below. Examples of the type of relationships among others that could lead to ineligibility are Applicants whose spouses, domestic partners, or parents are or were involved in actual intelligence activities, or members of the immediate family of prominent highly placed officials in an intelligence agency who might be the target of harassment or violence overseas as the result of family connections. Employment by an organization that has been funded by an intelligence agency may also lead to ineligibility.</P>
          <P>(3) In determining whether an Applicant's relationship to an intelligence agency or intelligence activity makes the Applicant ineligible for service, or in determining the duration of any ineligibility, the General Counsel will consider the following factors as appropriate:</P>
          <P>(i) Nature of the relationship.</P>
          <P>(ii) The intelligence agency with which the Applicant has the relationship.</P>
          <P>(iii) Duration of the relationship.</P>
          <P>(iv) Length of time that has elapsed since the last connection to the intelligence agency.</P>
          <P>(v) Where the intelligence activity or work was performed.</P>
          <P>(vi) Nature of the connection with intelligence activity or work.</P>
          <P>(vii) Whether or not the intelligence activity or work involved contact with foreign nationals.</P>
          <P>(viii) Whether the connection was known or unknown to the Applicant at the time it occurred.</P>
          <P>(ix) Training received, if any.</P>
          <P>(x) Regularity of the contact with foreign nationals, and nature of duties, if any.</P>
          <P>(xi) Public knowledge of the activity or connection.</P>
          <P>(xii) Any other information which bears on the relationship of the Applicant to an intelligence agency or intelligence activity.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination.</E> VRS is responsible for the initial screening of Peace Corps Volunteer applications for compliance with the provisions of this policy. In cases where that office is unable to make a decision regarding the eligibility of an Applicant under this policy, the individual's application will be referred to the General Counsel, who will make the determination on eligibility.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> VRS will inform all Applicants promptly and in writing of any decision to disqualify them based on an intelligence background and the reasons for that decision. Applicants have 15 days from the date of receipt of the letter from VRS to appeal the decision to the Director of the Peace Corps. The decision of the Director of the Peace Corps will be the final agency decision.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Post Peace Corps employment by United States intelligence agencies.</E> Pursuant to agreements between the Peace Corps and certain intelligence agencies, those intelligence agencies will not employ former Volunteers for a specified period after the end of their Peace Corps service and will not use former Volunteers for certain purposes or in certain positions. Information regarding such agreements may be obtained from the Office of the General Counsel.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Special circumstances.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Couples.</E> Two Applicants who are married to one another or two unmarried Applicants who are in a same-sex or opposite-sex domestic partnership or other committed relationship are eligible to apply for service as a couple. In the case of an unmarried couple, each member of the couple must provide a sworn statement, in a form acceptable to the Peace Corps, attesting to their domestic partnership status or committed relationship (as the case may be) and their request to be considered for assignment as a couple. In all cases, both members of the couple must apply and qualify for assignment at the same location.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Serving with dependents and other family members.</E> In general, dependents and other family members may not accompany a Volunteer during service. However, the Peace Corps may from time to time make exceptions either on a case-by-case basis or for particular categories of Volunteers to the extent permitted by Federal law.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Military service.</E> The Peace Corps welcomes applications from veterans, reservists, and active duty military personnel who are interested in Peace Corps service after completion of their military service. After receiving an invitation for Peace Corps service, applicants with reserve obligations are reminded to comply with all requirements to notify their reserve component that they will be unavailable for drills and annual training because of their Peace Corps service. Such applicants are urged to obtain written confirmation from their reserve component that they have complied with these requirements.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Background investigation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Section 22 of the Peace Corps Act requires that each Applicant be investigated to ensure that enrollment of the Applicant as a Volunteer is consistent with the national interest. The Peace Corps therefore obtains an appropriate background investigation for all Applicants who are invited to serve in the Peace Corps. Information revealed by the background investigation may be grounds for disqualification from Peace Corps service. Under the Peace Corps Act, if a background investigation regarding an Applicant develops any data reflecting that the Applicant is of questionable loyalty or is a questionable security risk, the Peace Corps must refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a full field investigation. The results of that full field investigation will be furnished to the Peace Corps for information and appropriate action.</P>

          <P>(2) Access to and use of identifiable personal data associated with automated data systems shall be limited to those persons whose official duties require such access. Proper control of personal data in any form associated with automated data systems shall be maintained at all times including maintenance of accountability records showing disposition of input and output documents.</P>
          <P>(3) All persons whose official duties require access to processing and maintenance of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be adequately trained in the security and privacy of personal data.</P>
          <P>(4) The disposal and disposition of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be carried on by shredding, burning or in the case of tapes of discs, degaussing, in accord with any regulations now or hereafter proposed by the GSA or other appropriate authority.</P>

          <P>The agency shall require reasonable identification of all individuals who request access to records to assure that records are not disclosed to persons not entitled to such access.</P>

          <P>(a) In the event an individual requests disclosure in person, such individual shall be required to show an identification card such as a driver's license, etc., containing a photo and a sample signature of such individual. Such individual may also be required to sign a statement under oath as to <PRTPAGE P="35"/>his or her identity acknowledging that he or she is aware of the penalties for improper disclosure under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974.</P>
          <P>(b) In the event that disclosure is requested by mail, the agency may request such information as may be necessary to reasonably assure that the individual making such request is properly identified.

          <SUBJECT>Amendment of records and appeals with respect thereto.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) In the event an individual desires to request an amendment of his or her record, he or she may do so by submitting such written request to the Director, Administrative Services, Peace Corps, 806 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20526. The Director, Administrative Services, shall provide assistance in preparing any amendment upon request and a written acknowledgment of receipt of such request within 10 working days after the receipt thereof from the individual who requested the amendment. Such acknowledgment may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to make a determination with respect to such request. If the agency decides to comply with the request within the 10 day period, no written acknowledgment is necessary: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That a certification of the change shall be provided to such individual within such period.</P>
          <P>(b) Promptly after acknowledgment of the receipt of a request for an amendment the agency shall take one of the following actions:</P>
          <P>(1) Make any corrections of any portion of the record which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely or complete.</P>
          <P>(2) Inform the individual of its refusal to amend the record in accord with the request together with the reason for such refusal and the procedures established for requesting review of such refusal by the head of the agency or his or her designee. Such notice shall include the name and business address of the reviewing official.</P>
          <P>(3) Refer the request to the agency that has control of and maintains the record in those instances where the record requested remains the property of the controlling agency and not of the Peace Corps.</P>

          <P>(c) In reviewing a request to amend the record the agency shall assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the record with due and appropriate regard for fairness to the individual about whom the record is maintained. In making such determination, the agency shall consult criteria for determining record quality published in pertinent chapters of the <E T="03">Federal Personnel Manual</E> and to the extent possible shall accord therewith.</P>
          <P>(d) In the event the agency agrees with the individual's request to amend such record it shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Advise the individual in writing,</P>
          <P>(2) Correct the record accordingly, and</P>
          <P>(3) Advise all previous recipients of a record which was corrected of the correction and its substance.</P>
          <P>(e) In the event the agency, after an initial review of the request to amend a record, disagrees with all or a portion of it, the agency shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Advise the individual of its refusal and the reasons therefore,</P>
          <P>(2) Inform the individual that he or she may request further review in accord with the provisions of these regulations, and</P>

          <P>(3) Specify The name and address of the person to whom the request should be directed.<PRTPAGE P="36"/>
          </P>
          <P>(f) In the event an individual requester disagrees with the initial agency determination, he or she may appeal such determination to the Director of the Peace Corps or his or her designee. Such request for review must be made within 30 days after receipt by the requester of the initial refusal to amend.</P>
          <P>(g) If after review the Director or designee refuses to amend the record as requested he or she shall advise the individual requester of such refusal and the reasons for same; of his or her right to file a concise statement in the record of the reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the agency; of the procedures for filing a statement of disagreement and of the fact that such statement so filed will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with a brief statement of the agency summarizing its reasons for refusal, if the agency decides to place such brief statement in the record. The agency shall have the authority to limit the length of any statement to be filed, such limit to depend upon the record involved. The agency shall also inform such individual that prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of both statements of the dispute to the extent that the accounting of disclosures has been maintained and of the individual's right to seek judicial review of the agency's refusal to amend the record.</P>
          <P>(h) If after review the official determines that the record should be amended in accordance with the individual's request, the agency shall proceed as provided above in the event a request is granted upon initial demand.</P>

          <P>(i) Final agency determination of an individual's request for a review shall be concluded with 30 working days from the date of receipt of the review request: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the Director or designee may determine that fair and equitable review cannot be made within that time. If such circumstances occur, the individual shall be notified in writing of the additional time required and of the approximate date on which determination of the review is expected to be completed.</P>

          <P>In the event that the agency finds it necessary to deny any individual access to a record about such individual pursuant to provisions of the Privacy Act or of these regulations, a response to the original request shall be made in writing within ten working days after the date of such initial request. The denial shall specify the reasons for such refusal or denial and advise the individual of the reasons therefore, and of his or her right to an appeal within the agency and/or judicial review under the provisions of the Act.</P>
          <P>(a) In the event an individual desires to appeal any denial of access, he or she may do so in writing by addressing such appeal to the attention of the Director, Peace Corps, or designee identified in such denial. Such appeal should be addressed to Director, Peace Corps, c/o Office of Administrative Services, Room P-314, 806 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20526.</P>
          <P>(b) The Director, or designee, shall review a request from a denial of access and shall make a determination with respect to such appeal within 30 days after receipt thereof. Notice of such determination shall be provided to the individual making the request in writing. If such appeal is denied in whole or in part, such notice shall include notification of the right of the person making such request to have judicial review of the denial as provided in the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Collection in installments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Whenever feasible, and except as required otherwise by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties, and administrative costs as required by this regulation, should be collected in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected under administrative offset, including salary offset, or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. If Peace Corps agrees to accept payment in installments, it may require a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of the payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and ability of the debtor to pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within three years.</P>

            <P>(c) Peace Corps may omit from a notice to a debtor one or more of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b) (6) through (10) of this section if Peace Corps determines that any provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be applied to a particular debt, or which have already been provided by prior notice, applicable agreement, or contract.</P>

            <P>(a) For purposes of this section, whenever Peace Corps is required to afford a debtor a review within the agency, Peace Corps shall provide the debtor with an opportunity for an internal review of the existence or the amount <PRTPAGE P="40"/>of the debt. For offset of current Federal salary under 5 U.S.C. 5514 for certain debts, debtors may also request an outside hearing. (See subpart C of this part)</P>
            <P>(b) Any request for a review must be in writing to the contact office by the payment due date stated in the initial notice sent under § 309.9(b) or other applicable provision. The debtor's request shall state the basis for the dispute and include any relevant documentation in support.</P>
            <P>(1) Peace Corps will provide for an internal review of the debt by an appropriate agency official. The review may include examination of documents, internal discussions with relevant officials and discussion by letter or orally with the debtor, at Peace Corps' discretion.</P>
            <P>(2) An oral hearing is not required when, in Peace Corps' determination, the matter can be decided on the documentary record. Peace Corps will provide a “paper hearing”, that is, a determination based upon a review of the written record unless Peace Corps makes a determination that a debt involves issues of credibility or veracity, at which point an oral hearing may be required. Unless otherwise required by law, such oral hearing shall not be a formal evidentiary hearing.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative offset</E>—(1) Payments otherwise due the debtor from the United States shall be offset from the debt in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3. These may be funds under the control of Peace Corps or other Federal agencies. Collection may be through centralized offset by the Financial Management Service (FMS) of the Department of the Treasury.</P>
            <P>(2) Such payments include but are not limited to vendor payments, salary, retirement, lump sum payments due upon Federal employment separation, travel reimbursements, tax refunds, loans or other assistance. Offset of Federal salary payments will be in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>
            <P>(3) Before administrative offset is instituted by another Federal agency or the FMS, Peace Corps shall certify in writing to that entity that the debt is past due and legally enforceable and that Peace Corps has complied with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal law and regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) Any other method authorized by law or regulation.</P>

            <P>(a) When Peace Corps is owed a debt by an employee of another agency, the other agency shall not initiate the requested offset until Peace Corps provides the agency with a written certification that the debtor owes Peace Corps a debt (including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of payment) and that Peace Corps has complied with these regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) When another agency is owed the debt, Peace Corps may use salary offset against one of its employees who is indebted to another agency, if requested to do so by that agency. Such request must be accompanied by a certification that the person owes the debt (including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of payment) and that the agency has complied with its regulations as required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.</P>

            <P>(6) The right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, an individual not under the supervision or control of the Peace Corps) with respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed, or the repayment schedule, so long as a petition is filed by the employee as prescribed;</P>
            <P>(7) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Peace Corps) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the creditor agency, and documented in the creditor agency's files;</P>

            <P>(11) The name and address of the office to which the petition should be sent;</P>
            <P>(12) That the Peace Corps will initiate certification procedures to implement a salary offset, as appropriate, (which may not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay) not less than 30 calendar days from the date of delivery of the notice of debt, unless the employee files a timely petition for a hearing;</P>

            <P>(13) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued <PRTPAGE P="42"/>at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 calendar days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;</P>
            <P>(14) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations or evidence may subject the employee to:</P>
            <P>(i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under the Peace Corps Act or the Foreign Service Act, Peace Corps regulations, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, §§ 3729-3731 of title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or any other applicable authority;</P>

            <P>(17) That proceedings with respect to such debt are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>
            <P>(b) Peace Corps is not required to provide prior notice to an employee when the following adjustments are made by Peace Corps to a Peace Corps employee's pay:</P>
            <P>(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less;</P>
            <P>(2) A routine adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting the adjustment; or</P>
            <P>(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt of $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature of the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting the adjustment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for outside hearing.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee who desires an outside hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the proposed offset schedule must send a request to the office designated in the notice of intent. See § 309.15(a)(8). The request must be received by the designated office not later than 20 calendar days after the date of delivery of the notice as provided in § 309.15(a). The request must be signed by the employee and should identify and explain with reasonable specificity and brevity the facts, evidence and witnesses which the employee believes support his or her position. If the employee objects to the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted from each check, the request should state the objection and the reasons for it. The employee must also specify whether an oral hearing or a review of the documentary evidence is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to submit timely.</E> (1) If the employee files a petition for a review after the expiration of the 20 calendar day period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the designated office may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control, or because of a failure to receive the notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee has actual knowledge of the filing deadline).</P>

            <P>(2) An employee waives the right to a review, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with Peace Corps' offset schedule, if the employee fails to file a request for a hearing unless such failure is excused as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="43"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) If the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified, unless the hearing official determines failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control, his or her appeal will be decided on the basis of the documents then available to the hearing official.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Representation at the hearing.</E> The creditor agency may be represented by a representative of its choice. The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of his or her choice and at his or her expense.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of Peace Corps records related to the debt.</E> (1) An employee who intends to inspect or copy creditor agency records related to the debt in accordance with § 309.15(a)(5), must send a letter to the official designated in the notice of intent to offset stating his or her intention. The letter must be sent within 20 calendar days after receipt of the notice.</P>
            <P>(2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the designated official will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related to the debt.</P>
            <P>(3) If personal inspection is impractical, copies of such records shall be sent to the employee.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Oral Hearing.</E> (1) If an employee timely files a request for an oral hearing under § 309.16(a), the matter will be conducted by a hearing official not under the supervision or control of Peace Corps.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (i) After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.</P>

            <P>(ii) An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (<E T="03">e.g.</E> when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a review of the available written record.</P>
            <P>(iv) The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart. Witnesses who provide testimony will do so under oath or affirmation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Decision.</E> The written decision shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary offset will commence, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> In the absence of good cause shown (<E T="03">e.g.</E> excused illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. The hearing official shall schedule a new hearing upon the request of the creditor agency representative when good cause is shown.</P>
            <P>(5) A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only. It does not supersede the finding by Peace Corps that a debt is owed and does not affect the Government's ability to recoup the debt through alternative collection methods under other appropriate methods.</P>

            <P>Unless otherwise provided by statute or contract, the following procedures apply to salary offset:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Method.</E> Salary offset will be made by deduction at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of the employee without his or her consent.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Source.</E> The source of salary offset is current disposable pay.<PRTPAGE P="44"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Types of collection</E>—(1) <E T="03">Lump sum payment.</E> Ordinarily debts will be collected by salary offset in one lump sum if possible. However, if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the collection by salary offset must be made in installment deductions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> (i) The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. If possible, the size of the deduction will be that necessary to liquidate the debt in no more than 1 year. However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, except as provided by other regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to greater amount.</P>
            <P>(ii) Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</P>
            <P>(iii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of not greater than the anticipated period of employment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Voluntary repayment agreements as an alternative to salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In response to a notice of intent, an employee may propose a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt and set forth a proposed repayment schedule. Any proposal under this paragraph must be received by the official designated in that notice within 20 calendar days after receipt of the notice of intent.</P>
            <P>(b) When the Peace Corps is the creditor agency, in response to a timely proposal by the debtor the agency will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the agency's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 calendar days from the date he or she received notice of the decision to file a petition for a review.</P>
            <P>(d) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and a designated agency official.</P>

            <P>(a) Under certain circumstances, employees may have a statutory right to request a waiver of indebtedness. When an employee makes a request under a statutory right, further collection will be stayed pending an administrative determination on the request.</P>
            <P>(b) Waiver of indebtedness is an equitable remedy and as such must be based on an assessment of the facts involved in the individual case under consideration. The burden is on the employee to demonstrate that the applicable waiver standard has been met.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered <PRTPAGE P="49"/>directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 311.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 311.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, <E T="03">professional and technical services</E> shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable.

            <P>(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.</P>
            <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>
            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

            <P>(a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 312.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must_</P>
            <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
            <P>(2) Include the employee's position title;</P>
            <P>(3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;</P>
            <P>(4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and</P>
            <P>(5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.</P>
            <P>(b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either_</P>
            <P>(1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or</P>
            <P>(2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 312.230</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How and when must I identify workplaces?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each Peace Corps award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces_</P>
            <P>(1) To the Peace Corps official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or</P>
            <P>(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by Peace Corps officials or their designated representatives.</P>

            <P>(b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).</P>
            <P>(c) If you identified workplaces to the Peace Corps awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the Peace Corps awarding official.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
          <P>It is the policy of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that Foreign Service Officers occupy positions in which there is a need and reasonable opportunity for interchangeability of personnel between the Board and posts abroad, and which are concerned with (a) the conduct, observation, or analysis of information and cultural activities, or (b) the executive management of, or administrative responsibility for, the overseas operations of the Board's program.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Noncompetitive interchange between Civil Service and Foreign Service.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) An agreement between the Office of Personnel Management and the Board under the provisions of Executive Order 11219 (3 CFR 1964-65 Comp. p. 303) provides for the noncompetitive appointment of present or former Foreign Service employees as career or career conditional Civil Service employees.</P>
          <P>(b) Under this agreement former career personnel of the Board's Foreign Service (FSCR, FSRU, FSIO, FSS, FSO, or FP) and such present personnel desiring to transfer, are eligible, under certain conditions, for noncompetitive career or career-conditional appointment in any Federal agency that desires to appoint them. The President has authorized the Office of Personnel Management by executive order to waive the requirements for competitive examination and appointment for such Board career Foreign Service personnel.</P>
          <P>(c) A present or former Civil Service employee may be appointed on a competitive basis in any Foreign Service class for which the employee has qualified under the provisions of section 3947 of title 22, United States Code.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 501.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Mid-level FSO Candidate Program (Class 3, 2, or 1).</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The mid-level FSO Candidate program, under the provisions of section 306 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, supplements the junior-level Career Candidate program to meet total requirements for Foreign Service Officers at the mid-level in the Foreign Service. Foreign Service limited appointments of FSO Candidates are made to Class 3, 2, or 1 for a period not to exceed five years. Occasionally, appointments may be offered at the Class 4 level. The FSO Commissioning Board will determine whether FSO Candidates have performed at a satisfactory level and demonstrated the required level of growth potential and competence, and will make a recommendation on commissioning as Foreign Service Officers. FSO Candidates who are not recommended for commissioning prior to the expiration of their limited appointment will be separated from the mid-level program.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Sources of applicants.</E> (1) The Broadcasting Board of Governors draws <PRTPAGE P="76"/>a significant number of FSO Candidates from Board employees who apply, and are found qualified by the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service (BEX).</P>
          <P>(2) The Board also draws Candidates from outside applicants who possess skills and abilities in short supply in the Foreign Service and who have capabilities, insights, techniques, experiences, and differences of outlook which would serve to enrich the Foreign Service and enable them to perform effectively in assignments both abroad and in the United States. Minority applicants are recruited for mid-level entry under the COMRAT program. Appointment from sources outside the Board is limited and based on intake levels established in accordance with total Broadcasting Board of Governors FSO workforce and functional requirements. Such appointments are based on successful completion of the examination process, and existing assignment vacancies.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility requirement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Broadcasting Board of Governors Employees.</E> On the date of application, employees must have at least three years of Federal Government service in a position of responsibility in the Board. A position of responsibility is defined as service as an Overseas Specialist at Class 4 or above or as a Domestic Specialist at GS-11 or above within the Board. The duties and responsibilities of the position occupied by the applicant must have been similar or closely related to those of a Foreign Service Officer in terms of knowledge, skills, abilities, and overseas experience. Board Domestic and Overseas Specialists must be no more than 58 years of age on the date of redesignation or appointment as an FSO Candidate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicants Under Special Recruitment Programs.</E> Minority and women applicants must be no more than 58 years of age, must have approximately nine years of education or experience relevant to work performed in Broadcasting Board of Governors, must be knowledgeable in the social, political and cultural history of the U.S. and be able to analyze and interpret this in relation to U.S. Government policy and American life.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Outside Applicants.</E> On the date of appointment, applicants must be no more than 58 years of age, with nine years of relevant work experience and/or education, or proficiency in a language for which the Board has a need, or substantial management expertise. Relevant work experience is defined as public relations work, supervisory or managerial positions in communications media, program director for a museum or university-level teacher of political science, history, English or other relevant disciplines. Appointments from these sources for the limited vacancies available are made on a competitive basis to fill specific Service needs after ensuring that the vacancies cannot be filled by Foreign Service Officers already in the Foreign Service Officer Corps.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Application Procedures.</E> (1) Applicants must complete Standard Form 171, Application for Federal Employment; Form DSP-34, Supplement to Application for Federal Employment; a 1,000 word autobiography; a statement affirming willingness and capacity to serve at any post worldwide; and transcripts of all graduate and undergraduate course work and forward them to the Special Recruitment Branch, Office of Personnel (M/PDSE).</P>
          <P>(2) The filing of an application for the Foreign Service does not in itself entitle an applicant to examination. The decision to proceed with an oral examination is made by a Qualifications Evaluation Panel after determining the applicant's eligibility for appointment and reviewing the applicant's qualifications including his/her performance, and administrative files (or equivalents), claimed language proficiency and other background or factors which may be related to the work performed by FSOs. An oral examination is given only in those cases where the applicant is found to possess superior qualifications, proven ability, and high potential for success in the Foreign Service.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Examination process</E>—(1) <E T="03">Written Examination.</E> A written examination will not normally be required of applicants for FSO Candidate appointments. However, if the volume of applications for a given class or classes is such as to make it infeasible to examine applicants orally within a reasonable time, <PRTPAGE P="77"/>such applicants may be required to take an appropriate written examination prescribed by the Board of Examiners. Those who meet or exceed the passing level set by the Board of Examiners on the written examination will be eligible for selection for the oral examination.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Oral examination.</E> (i) Applicants approved by the Qualifications Evaluation Panel for examination will be given an oral examination by a panel of Deputy Examiners approved by the Board of Examiners. The oral examination is designed to enable the Board of Examiners to determine whether applicants are functionally qualified for work in the Foreign Service at the mid-level, whether they would be suitable representatives abroad of the United States, whether they have the potential to advance in the Foreign Service, and whether they have the background and experience to make a contribution to the Foreign Service. The oral examination is individually scheduled throughout the year and is normally given in Washington, D.C. At the discretion of the Board of Examiners, it may be given in other American cities, or at Foreign Service posts, selected by the Board.</P>
          <P>(ii) The panel will orally examine each applicant through questioning and discussion. There will also be a writing exercise and an in-basket test. Applicants taking the oral examination will be graded according to the standards established by the Board of Examiners. The application of anyone whose score is at or above the passing level set by the Board will be continued. The application of anyone whose score is below the passing level will be terminated. The applicant may, however, reapply in 12 months by submitting a new application.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Foreign language requirement.</E> All applicants who pass the oral examination will be required to take a subsequent test to measure their fluency in foreign languages, or their aptitude for learning them (MLAT) for which a score of 50 points (on a scale of zero to eighty) is necessary to qualify for further processing. No applicant will be recommended for career appointment who has not demonstrated such a proficiency or aptitude. An applicant may be selected, appointed and assigned without first having demonstrated required proficiency in a foreign language, but the appointment will be subject to the condition that the employee may not receive more than one promotion and may not be commissioned as an FSO until proficiency in one foreign language is achieved.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Medical examination.</E> Those applicants recommended by the Board of Examiners for an FSO candidacy, and their dependents who will reside with them overseas, are required to pass a physical examination at the Department of State Medical Division.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Security and suitability considerations.</E> A background investigation or appropriate security clearance update will be conducted on each applicant, and no application may be continued until a security clearance has been granted.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Class of appointment.</E> The Board of Examiners fixes the entry level for appointment as an FSO candidate.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Certification for appointment.</E> After completion of all aspects of the examination, the Board of Examiners certifies to the Board successful candidates for appointment as FSO Candidates. Determinations of duly constituted panels of examiners and deputy examiners are final, unless modified by specific action of the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service.</P>
          <P>(8) <E T="03">FSO Candidate registers.</E> (i) After approval by the Board of Examiners, and certification as to suitability and security clearance by the Board's Director of Security, successful applicants will have their names placed on a register for the class for which they have been found qualified. Appointments to available openings will be made from the applicants entered on the register for the class of the position to be filled. Inclusion on the register does not guarantee eventual assignment and appointment as an FSO Candidate. Applicants who have qualified but have not been appointed because of lack of openings will be dropped from the register 18 months after the date of placement on it (or the completion of an inside applicant's current overseas tour, whichever is longer). Such applicants may reapply for the program, but will be required to <PRTPAGE P="78"/>repeat the entire application process, including BEX testing.</P>
          <P>(ii) Any applicant on the register who refuses an assignment offer will be removed from the Register and will not be eligible to reapply for the program for seven years.</P>
          <P>(iii) The Board of Examiners may extend the eligibility period when such extension is in its judgment justified in the interest of the Foreign Service.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Appointment as an FSO Candidate.</E> (1) An FSO Candidate will be given a four-year Foreign Service limited appointment. Board Career Overseas Specialists will be redesignated as FSO Candidates for a period of four years. The appointment or redesignation may be extended for one year, but must be terminated at the end of the fifth year. The purpose of the FSO Candidacy is to permit on-the-job evaluation of an individual's suitability and capacity for effective service as a Foreign Service Officer.</P>
          <P>(2) FSO Candidates will be assigned to Generalist positions overseas, and will compete for promotion with other Generalist officers under the Annual Generalist Selection Boards. FSO Candidates at the Class 1 level may not compete for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service prior to commissioning as an FSO.</P>
          <P>(3) The FSO Candidacy may be terminated during the four-year period for unsatisfactory performance (22 U.S.C. 4011) or for such other cause as will promote the efficiency of the Service (22 U.S.C. 4010).</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Commissioning as a Foreign Service Officer.</E> (1) Upon completion of three years' service (most of which will have been overseas), the FSO Candidate will be eligible for commissioning as a Foreign Service Officer. The FSO Commissioning Board will review all FSO Candidates appointed on or after March 1, 1980 and will recommend on tenure.</P>
          <P>(2) The criterion used for deciding whether to recommend commissioning of FSO Candidates is the Candidate's demonstrated potential to perform effectively as a Foreign Service Officer in a normal range of generalist assignments up through the Class 1 level. No quota or numerical limit is placed on the number of affirmative decisions.</P>
          <P>(3) If recommended for commissioning, and having satisfied the language proficiency requirements, the name of the FSO Candidate will be forwarded to the President and the Senate and, upon approval, the FSO Candidate will be commissioned as an FSO.</P>
          <P>(4) If the FSO Commissioning Board does not recommend commissioning of the FSO Candidate during its review, it may recommend extension of the FSO Candidacy to allow for a future review. Under no circumstances will an FSO Candidacy be extended to a total of more than five years.</P>
          <P>(5) Candidates not recommended for commissioning or who have not satisfied the language proficiency requirement will be separated from the Service at the expiration of their appointment. However, FSO Candidates who were appointed from within the Board with career status as a Domestic or Overseas Specialist may exercise reappointment rights to their previous category in lieu of separation.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 501.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Appointment of Overseas Specialists.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Members of the Board's Foreign Service appointed as Overseas Specialists serve on rotational U.S.-overseas assignments in the following types of positions: General Administration; Publication Writers and Editors; Exhibit Managers; Printing Specialists; English Teaching Specialists; Correspondents; Engineers for the Voice of America; Regional Librarian Consultants; and Secretaries. Appointees serve a trial period of service as Specialist Candidates under Foreign Service limited appointments (or redesignation) for a period not to exceed five years. Appointments are made to F.S. classes 8 through 1. Specialist Candidates are given career appointments as Overseas Specialists based on the recommendations of Specialist Selection Boards. Specialist candidates not recommended for tenuring will be separated from the Foreign Service, or reinstated in the Civil Service.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Sources of applicants.</E> Qualified Broadcasting Board of Governors domestic employees comprise a significant recruitment source for Overseas Specialist appointments. Such employees will be given priority consideration <PRTPAGE P="79"/>over outside applicants when applying for Overseas Specialist positions, when qualifications are otherwise equal.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility requirements.</E> All applicant must be citizens of the United States, and must be at least 21 years of age and no more than 58 years of age at the time of appointment. The 21-year age requirement may be waived by the Director, Office of Personnel (M/P or VOA/P) when she or he determines that the applicant's services are urgently needed. Broadcasting Board of Governors employee applicants must also have at least three years of Federal government experience and occupy a position at the GS-11 level (or equivalent) or above (GS-10 for Electronic Technicians in the Voice of America). All applicants must be available for worldwide assignment to positions in their occupational category.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Application procedures.</E> (1) Applications for all specialties except secretarial should include a current SF-171, Application for Federal Employment; a DSP-34, Supplement to Application for Federal Employment; university transcripts; a 1,000 word autobiographical statement which should include mention of the qualifications the applicant would bring to the job and reason for desiring to work for the Board; and a statement affirming willingness and capacity to serve at any post worldwide.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Special requirements for Foreign Service Secretaries.</E> Secretarial applicants must submit a current SF-171, Application for Federal Employment, and a 250 word essay on a commonly understood subject to demonstrate grammatical competence. The following specific requirements must be met by applicants: Ability to type accurately at 60 words per minute; four years of secretarial or administrative experience (business school or college training may be substituted for up to two years of required work experience); and attainment of an acceptable score in verbal ability and spelling tests. Applicants will subsequently be given a written examination to measure administrative aptitude.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Examination process</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application review.</E> All applications are to be sent to the Special Recruitment Staff, Office of Personnel (M/PDSE), or to the Foreign Personnel Advisor (VOA/PF) for Voice of America positions.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Qualifications Evaluation Panel.</E> A Qualifications Evaluation Panel will evaluate the applicant's qualifications including his/her performance and administrative files (or equivalent), claimed language proficiency and other background or factors which may be related to the work performed by an Overseas Specialist Officer in the relevant specialty.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Oral examination.</E> (i) Applicants who are passed on by the Qualifications Evaluation Panel to the Board of Examiners will be given an oral examination to evaluate the applicant's total qualifications for service as an Overseas Specialist in the desired functional specialty.</P>
          <P>(ii) The Board panel examining all candidates except those of the Voice of America will consist of one Broadcasting Board of Governors Overseas Specialist and two BEX Deputy Examiners. For VOA candidates, the panel will consist of the Foreign Personnel Advisor, a BEX Deputy Examiner assigned to the Voice of America, and a Deputy Examiner assigned to the Board of Examiners.</P>
          <P>(iii) The panel will examine each applicant through questioning and discussion. Hypothetical problem-solving exercises, a writing exercise and an in-basket test may also be required. The panel will also recommend the F.S. entry level for appointment. If the panel's recommendation is unfavorable, the application process will be discontinued. An unsuccessful applicant may apply again in 12 months.</P>
          <P>(4) The same medical and security requirements applicable to FSO Candidates pertain to Specialist Candidates.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Overseas Specialist Candidate register.</E> If an applicant is successful in the examination, and medical and security clearances have been successfuly completed, his/her name will be added to the appropriate Overseas Specialist register for a period of 18 months, or completion of an inside candidate's current tour of duty overseas, whichever is longer, at the Foreign Service class determined in the examination process and based on previous experience. Inclusion on the register does not <PRTPAGE P="80"/>guarantee eventual assignment and appointment as an Overseas Specialist Candidate.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Appointment as a Specialist Candidate.</E> (1) When the Office of Personnel identifies an overseas vacancy which cannot be filled from the existing ranks of Overseas Specialists, applicants on the Overseas Specialist register will be considered for the assignment. An applicant will not be appointed unless an overseas position has been identified and a need for the individual in the Foreign Service has been certified by the Director, Office of Personnel (M/P or VOA/P). Any applicant selected from the register who refuses an assignment offer will be dropped from the register and precluded from reapplying for a period of seven years.</P>
          <P>(2) Applicants will be given a Foreign Service limited appointment (or redesignation) for a period of four years at the Foreign Service Class determined in the examination process. The purpose of this untenured appointment is to allow the Board to evaluate and assess the Specialist Candidate's abilities and future potential prior to offering career appointment as an Overseas Specialist. The limited appointment may be extended for one additional year, but must be terminated at the end of the fifth year if the Candidate does not obtain career tenure.</P>
          <P>(3) The Candidate will receive the orientation and training necessary to serve overseas and will be assigned overseas in a position in his or her specialty. Broadcasting Board of Governors Civil Service employees selected as Overseas Specialist Candidates will be appointed only if the Board element to which they are currently assigned is willing to affirm in writing that a position at the appropriate level will be made available for the employee should the candidacy end unsuccessfully. Broadcasting Board of Governors Civil Service applicants will be appointed as Overseas Specialist Candidates on or about the date of their departure for post of assignment or upon assumption of an assignment (which has been identified and will follow a period of orientation in Washington). The Board may also assign a Candidate to a U.S.-based position for an initial assignment of up to 24 months when the Candidate will spend the majority of his/her time traveling overseas and will, except for the U.S. basing, be fully functioning as an Overseas Specialist. Specialist Candidates will compete for promotion by the Annual Overseas Specialist Selection Board with other officers in the same specialty and at the same class level. Specialist Candidates at the Class 1 level are ineligible for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service.</P>
          <P>(4) The Specialist candidacy may be terminated at any time for unsatisfactory performance (22 U.S.C. 4011) or for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the Service (22 U.S.C. 4010).</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Career appointment as an Overseas Specialist.</E> In accordance with section 3946 of title 22 United States Code, the decision to offer a Specialist Candidate a career appointment will be based on the recommendation made by the Annual Overseas Specialist Selection Board which reviews all employees in the Candidate's occupational category and class level.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> Specialist Candidates who have performed at least two years of overseas service will be eligible for review for career status at the time of the Candidate's third Board review. Candidates serving an initial tour in the U.S. but spending the majority of time working overseas will be credited with up to one year's overseas service, but no more than half of the time based in the U.S. If a Specialist Candidate is not recommended for career status during the initial review, the Candidate may be reviewed again when the next Annual Overseas Specialist Selection Board convenes if the initial Board so recommends.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Selection Board Review.</E> The Selection Board(s) will review the official performance file of the eligible Specialist Candidates and in accordance with established precepts, will determine whether the Candidates should be recommended for career appointment as Overseas Specialists. Recommendations by the Board will be based on the Candidate's demonstrated aptitude and fitness for a career in the Foreign Service in their occupational specialties. No quota or numerical limit is placed on the number of positive career status <PRTPAGE P="81"/>decisions that can be made by Selection Boards. The Specialist candidacy will be terminated if the Candidate fails to be recommended for career status after a second Board review for tenuring. Candidates may be terminated earlier than the expiration of their limited appointment if so recommended by the Board and approved by the Director, Office of Personnel (M/P or VOA/P). Specialist Candidates recommended for career status by the Selection Board will be given Foreign Service career appointments (or redesignation) as Overseas Specialist, to take effect within one month of the Board's recommendation.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction and definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and this part apply to all records of The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). As a general policy BBG follows a balanced approach in administering the FOIA. We recognize the right of public access to information in the Agency's possession, but we also seek to protect the integrity of the Agency's internal processes. This policy calls for the fullest possible disclosure of records consistent with those requirements of administrative necessity and confidentiality which are recognized by the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions:</E>
          </P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Access Appeal Committee or Committee</E> means the Committee delegated by the Agency Head for making final agency determinations regarding appeals from the initial denial of records under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Agency or BBG</E> means the Broadcasting Board of Governors. It includes all parts of the BBG in the U.S. and its worldwide operations.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Commercial use,</E> when referring to a request, means that the request is from, or on behalf of, one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and how the records will be used. The identity of the requester (individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), or the nature of the records, while in some cases indicative of that purpose or use, is not necessarily determinative. When a request is made by a representative of the news media, the request shall be deemed to be for a non-commercial use.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Department</E> means any executive department, military department, government corporation, government controlled corporation, any independent regulatory agency, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government. A private organization is not a department even if it is performing work under contract with the Government or is receiving Federal financial assistance. Grantee and contractor records are not subject to the FOIA unless they are in the possession and control of the BBG.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a record and sending it to the requester, to the extent necessary to respond to the request. Such copies include paper copy, microform, audiovisual materials, and magnetic tapes, cards and discs.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, elementary or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of professional or vocational education.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">FOIA</E> means the Freedom of Information Act, section 552 of title 5, United States Code, as amended.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Freedom of Information Officer</E> means the BBG official who has been delegated the authority to release or withhold records and assess, waive, or reduce fees in response to FOIA requests.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated substantially for the purposes of furthering its own or someone else's business, trade, or profit interests, and that is operated for purposes of conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Records</E> (and any other term used in this section in reference to information) include any information that would be an agency record subject to the requirements of this section when maintained by the Agency in any format, including an electronic format. Records also include any handwritten, typed or printed documents (such as memoranda, books, brochures, studies, writings, drafts, letters, transcripts, and minutes) and documentary material in other forms (such as punchcards, magnetic tapes, cards, or discs; paper tapes; audio or video recordings, <PRTPAGE P="87"/>maps, photographs, slides, microfilm, and motion pictures). It does not include objects or articles such as exhibits, models, equipment, and duplication machines or audiovisual processing materials. Reports does not include books, magazines, pamphlets, or other reference material in formally organized and officially designated BBG libraries, where such materials are available under the rules of the particular library.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means a person actively gathering news for an entity organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. <E T="03">News</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. News media entities include television and radio broadcasters, publishers of periodicals (to the extent they publish “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public, and entities that may disseminate news through other media (e.g., electronic dissemination of text). Freelance journalists shall be considered representatives of a news media entity if they can show a solid basis for expecting publication through such an entity. A publication contract or a requester's past publication record may show such a basis.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Request</E> means asking in writing for records whether or not the request refers specifically to the FOIA.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Review</E> means examining the records to determine which portions, if any, may be released, and any other processing that is necessary to prepare the records for release. It includes only the first examination and processing of the requested documents for purposes of determining whether a specific exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Search</E> means looking for records or portions of records responsive to a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request, and also page-by-page and line-by-line examination to identify responsive portions of a document. However, it does not include line-by-line examination where merely duplicating the entire page would be a less expensive and quicker way to comply with the request.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 503.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Making a request.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">How to request records.</E> All requests for documents shall be made in writing. Requests should be addressed to The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), FOIA/Privacy Act Officer, Office of the General Counsel, 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Suite 3349, Washington, DC 20237; telephone (202) 260-4404; or fax (202) 260-4394. Write the words “Freedom of Information Act Request” on the envelope and letter.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Details in your letter.</E> Your request for documents should provide as many details as possible that will help us find the records you are requesting. If there is insufficient information, we will ask you to provide greater details. Include your telephone number(s) to help us reach you if we have questions. If you are not sure how to write your request or what details to include, you may call the FOIA Office to request a copy of the Agency's booklet “Guide and Index of Records,” or access the same information via the Internet on BBG's World Wide Web site (<E T="03">http://www.ibb.gov</E>). The more specific the request for documents, the sooner the Agency will be able to respond to your request(s).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests not handled under FOIA.</E> We will not provide documents requested under the FOIA and this part if the records are currently available in the National Archives, subject to release through the Archives, or commonly sold to the public by it or another agency in accordance with statutory authority (for example, records currently available from the Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information Service). Agency records that are normally freely available to the general public, such as BBG press releases, are not covered by the FOIA. Requests for documents from Federal departments, Chairmen of Congressional committees or subcommittees and court orders are not FOIA requests.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Referral of requests outside the agency.</E> If you request records that were created by or provided to us by another Federal department, we may refer your request to or consult with that department. We may also refer requests for classified records to the department that classified them. In cases <PRTPAGE P="88"/>of referral, the other department is responsible for processing and responding to your request under that department's regulation. When possible, we will notify you when we refer your request to another department.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Responding to your request</E>—(1) <E T="03">Retrieving records.</E> The Agency is required to furnish copies of records only when they are in our possession and control. If we have stored the records you want in a record retention center, we will retrieve and review them for possible disclosure. However, the Federal Government destroys many old records, so sometimes it is impossible to fill requests. The Agency's record retention policies are set forth in the General Records Schedules of the National Archives and Records Administration and in BBG's Records Disposition Schedule, which establish time periods for keeping records before they may be destroyed.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Furnishing records.</E> (i) The Agency is only required to furnish copies of records that we have or can retrieve. We are not compelled to create new records. The Agency will aid requesters by providing records and information in the form requested, including electronic format, if we can readily reproduce them in that form or format.</P>
          <P>(ii) We may decide to conserve government resources and at the same time supply the records you need by consolidating information from various records, in paper form or electronically, rather than copying them all. If the effort to produce records in electronic format would significantly interfere with the operations of the Agency, we will consider the effort to be an unreasonable search.</P>
          <P>(iii) The Agency is required to furnish only one copy of a record. If we are unable to make a legible copy of a record to be released, we will not attempt to reconstruct it. Rather we will furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in our reply or on the copy.</P>
          <P>(iv) If we cannot accommodate your request for form or format, we will provide responsive, nonexempt information in a reasonably accessible form.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 503.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Availability of agency records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Release of records.</E> If we have released a record or part of a record to others in the past, we will ordinarily release it to you also. This principle does not apply if the previous release was an unauthorized disclosure. However, we will not release it to you if a statute forbids this disclosure and we will not necessarily release it to you if an exemption applies in your situation and did not apply or applied differently in the previous situation.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Denial of requests.</E> All denials are in writing and describe in general terms the material withheld and state the reasons for the denial, including a reference to the specific exemption of the FOIA authorizing the withholding or deletion. The denial also explains your right to appeal the decision and it will identify the official to whom you should send the appeal. Denial letters are signed by the person who made the decision to deny all or part of the request, unless otherwise noted.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Unproductive searches.</E> We will make a diligent search for records to satisfy your request. Nevertheless, we may not be able always to find the records you want using the information you provided, or they may not exist. If we advise you that we have been unable to find the records despite a diligent search, you will nevertheless be provided the opportunity to appeal the adequacy of the Agency's search. However, if your request is for records that are obviously not connected with this Agency or your request has been provided to us in error, a “no records” response will not be considered an adverse action and you will not be provided an opportunity to appeal.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Appeal of denials.</E> You have the right to appeal a partial or full denial of your FOIA request. To do so, you must put your appeal in writing and address it to the official identified in the denial letter. Your appeal letter must be dated and postmarked within 30 calendar days from the date of the Agency's denial letter. Because we have some discretionary authority in deciding whether to release or withhold records, you may strengthen your appeal by explaining your reasons for wanting the records. However, you are not required to give any explanation. <PRTPAGE P="89"/>Your appeal will be reviewed by the Agency's Access Appeal Committee that consists of senior Agency officials. When the Committee responds to your appeal, that constitutes the Agency's final action on the request. If the Access Appeal Committee grants your appeal in part or in full, we will send the records to you promptly or set up an appointment for you to inspect them. If the decision is to deny your appeal in part or in full, the final letter will state the reasons for the decision, name the officials responsible for the decision, and inform you of the FOIA provisions for judicial review.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 503.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Time limits.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The FOIA sets certain time limits for us to decide whether to disclose the records you requested, and to decide appeals. If we fail to meet the deadlines, you may proceed as if we had denied your request or your appeal. Since requests may be misaddressed or misrouted, you should call or write to confirm that we have the request and to learn its status if you have not heard from us in a reasonable time.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Time allowed.</E> (1) We will decide whether to release records within 20 working days after your request reaches the appropriate area office that maintains the records you are requesting. When we decide to release records, we will actually provide the records at that time, or as soon as possible after that decision, or let you inspect them as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
          <P>(2) We will decide an appeal within 20 working days after the appeal reaches the appropriate reviewing official.</P>
          <P>(3)(i) The FOIA Officer or appeal official may extend the time limits in unusual circumstances for initial requests or appeals, up to 10 working days. We will notify you in writing of any extensions. “Unusual circumstances” include situations where we: Search for and collect records from field facilities, records centers or locations other than the office processing the records; search for, collect, or examine a great many records in response to a single request; consult with another office or department that has substantial interest in the determination of the request; and/or conduct negotiations with submitters and requesters of information to determine the nature and extent of non-disclosable proprietary materials.</P>
          <P>(ii) If an extra ten days still does not provide sufficient time for the Agency to deal with your request, we will inform you that the request cannot be processed within the statutory time limit and provide you with the opportunity to limit the scope of your request and/or arrange with us a negotiated deadline for processing your request.</P>
          <P>(iii) If you refuse to reasonably limit the scope of your request or refuse to agree upon a time frame, the Agency will process your case, as it would have, had no modification been sought. We will make a diligent, good faith effort to complete our review within the statutory time frame.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 503.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Records available for public inspection.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) To the extent that they exist, we will make the following records of general interest available for you in paper form or electronically for inspection or copying:</P>

          <P>(1) Orders and final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions in adjudications. (<E T="03">See</E> § 503.8(e) of this part for availability of internal memoranda, including attorney opinions and advice.)</P>

          <P>(2) Statements of policy and interpretations that we have adopted but which have not been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect the public. (We will not make available, however, manuals or instructions that reveal investigative or audit procedures as described in § 503.8(b) and (g) of this part.)</P>
          <P>(4) In addition to such records as those described in this paragraph (a), we will make available to any person a copy of all other Agency records, in the format requested, if available, unless we determine that such records should be withheld from disclosure under subsection (b) of the Act and §§ 503.8 and 503.9 of this part.</P>

          <P>(b) Before releasing these records, however, we may delete the names of people, or information that would identify them, if release would invade their <PRTPAGE P="90"/>personal privacy to a clearly unwarranted degree (<E T="03">See</E> § 503.8(f)).</P>
          <P>(c) The Agency's FOIA Guide and Index is available electronically via the Internet, or you may request a copy of it by mail.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 503.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Restrictions on some agency records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Under the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1461, as amended), the BBG is prohibited from disseminating within the United States information about the U.S., its people, and its policies when such materials have been prepared by the Agency for audiences abroad. This includes films, radio scripts and tapes, videotapes, books, and similar materials produced by the Agency. However, this law does provide that upon request, such information shall be made available at BBG, for examination only, by representatives of the press, magazines, radio systems and stations, research students or scholars and available, for examination only, to Members of Congress.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 503.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—categories of requests.</E> Paragraphs (a)(1) though (3) and (b) through (e) of this section explain each category of request and the type of fees that we will generally charge. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons given in paragraph (e) of this section. “Request” means asking for records, whether or not you refer specifically to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Requests from Federal agencies and court orders for documents are not included within this definition. “Review” means, when used in connection with processing records for a commercial use request, examining the records to determine what portions, if any, may be withheld, and any other processing that is necessary to prepare the records for release. It includes only the examining and processing that are done the first time we analyze whether a specific exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. It does not include the process of researching or resolving general legal, or policy issues regarding exemptions. “Search” means looking for records or portions of records responsive to a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request, and also and line-by-line examination to identify responsive portions of a document.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request.</E> If your request is for a commercial use, BBG will charge you the costs of search, review and duplication. “Commercial use” means that the request is from or on behalf of one whom seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and how the records will be used; the identity of the requester (individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), or the nature of the records, while in some cases may indicate the purpose or use is not necessarily determinative. When a request is made by a representative of the news media, a purpose of use which supports the requester's news dissemination function is deemed to be a non-commercial use.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and scientific institutions and news media.</E> If you are an educational institution or a non-commercial scientific institution, operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and your request is not for a commercial use, BBG will charge you only for the duplication of documents. Also BBG will not charge you the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication. “Educational institution” means a preschool, elementary or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of professional or vocational education. “Non-commercial scientific institution” means an institution that is not operated substantially for purposes of furthering its own or someone else's business, trade, or profit interests, and that is operated for purposes of conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. “Representative of the news media” means a person actively gathering news for an entity organized and operated to publish or broadcast news <PRTPAGE P="91"/>to the public. “News” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. News media entities include television and radio broadcasters, publishers of periodicals (to the extent they publish “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public, and entities that may disseminate news through other media (e.g., electronic dissemination of text). We will treat freelance journalists as representatives of a news media entity if they can show a solid basis for expecting publication through such an entity. A publication contract is such a basis and the requester's past publication record may show such a basis.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Other requesters.</E> If your request is not the kind described by paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the BBG will charge you only for search and duplication. Also, we will not charge you for the first two hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplication.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees to be charged—general provisions.</E> (1) We may charge search fees even if the records we find are exempt from disclosure, or even if we do not find any records at all.</P>
          <P>(2) We will not charge you any fee at all if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. We have estimated that cost to be $5.00.</P>
          <P>(3) If we determine that you are acting alone or with others to break down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid or reduce the fees charged, we may aggregate all these requests for purposes of calculating the fees charged.</P>
          <P>(4) We will charge interest on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day following the day the bill was sent. The accrual of interest will stop upon receipt of the fee, rather than upon its processing by BBG. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 32 U.S.C.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee schedule—BBG will charge the following fees:</E> (1) Manual searching for or reviewing of records:</P>
          <P>(i) When performed by employees at salary grade GS-1 through GS-8 or FS-9 through FS-5—an hourly rate of $10.00 will be charged;</P>
          <P>(ii) When performed by employees at salary grade GS-9 through GS-13 or FS-5 through FS-2—an hourly rate of $20.00 will be charged;</P>
          <P>(iii) When performed by employees at salary grade GS-14 or above or FS-2 or above—an hourly rate of $36.00 will be charged.</P>
          <P>(iv) When a search involves employees at more than one of these levels, we will charge the appropriate rate for each.</P>
          <P>(2) Computer searching and printing. Except in unusual cases, the cost of computer time will not be a factor in calculating the two free hours of search time. In those unusual cases, where the cost of conducting a computerized search significantly detracts from the Agency's ordinary operations, no more than the dollar cost of two hours of manual search time shall be allowed. For searches conducted beyond the first two hours, the Agency shall only charge the direct costs of conducting such searches.</P>
          <P>(3) Photocopying standard size pages—$0.15 per page.</P>
          <P>(4) Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or blueprints) or reproducing other records (such as tapes)—the actual cost of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the materials used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) Certifying that records are true copies—this service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge $10.00 per certification.</P>
          <P>(6) Sending records by express mail, certified mail, or other special methods. This service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge our actual cost.</P>
          <P>(7) Performing any other special service that you request and to which we agree—actual cost of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materials used, plus charges for the time of our employees, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for assessing and collecting fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Agreement to pay.</E> We generally assume that when you request records you are willing to pay <PRTPAGE P="92"/>the fees we charge for services associated with your request. You may specify a limit on the amount you are willing to spend. We will notify you if it appears that the fees will exceed the limit and ask whether you nevertheless want us to proceed with the search.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> If you have failed to pay previous bills in a timely manner, or if our initial review of your request indicates that we will charge you fees exceeding $250.00, we will require you to pay your past due fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before we start searching for the records you want, or before we send them to you. In such cases, the administrative time limits as described in Sec. 503.4(b), will begin only after we come to an agreement with you over payment of fees, or decide that a fee waiver or reduction is appropriate.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> We will waive or reduce the fees we would otherwise charge if disclosure of the information meets both of the following tests (paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section):</P>
          <P>(1) It is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, regardless of any other public interest it may further. In making this determination, we may consider:</P>
          <P>(i) Whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding;</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether the requester's intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information among the public.</P>
          <P>(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Not only profit-making corporations have commercial interests; so do nonprofit corporations, individuals, unions, and other associations.</P>
          <P>(3) You must make your request for a waiver or reduction at the same time you make your request for records. Only the FOIA Officer may make the decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If we do not completely grant your request for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will designate the appeal official.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 503.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions to the mandatory disclosure of records. These exemptions and their application by the Agency are described below. In some cases, more than one exemption may apply to the same document. This section does not itself authorize the giving of any pledge of confidentiality by any officer or employee of the Agency.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemption one—National defense and foreign policy.</E> We are not required to release records that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified according to such Executive Order. Executive Order No. 12958 (1995) provides for such classification. When the release of certain records may adversely affect U.S. relations with foreign countries, we usually consult with officials with knowledge of those countries and/or with officials of the Department of State. We may also have in our possession records classified by another agency. If we do, we may consult with that agency or may refer your request to that agency for their direct response to you. If possible, we will notify you that we have made such a referral.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemption two—Internal personnel rules and practices.</E> We are not required to release records that are related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. We may withhold routine internal agency procedures such as guard schedules and luncheon periods. We may also withhold internal records the release of which would help some persons circumvent the law or Agency regulations.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemption three—Records exempted by other statutes.</E> We are not required to release records if another statute specifically allows us to withhold them. Another statute may be used only if it absolutely prohibits disclosure or if it <PRTPAGE P="93"/>sets forth criteria identifying particular types of material to be withheld (for example, the statute discussed in § 503.6).</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption four—Trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.</E> We will withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is obtained from a person and is privileged or confidential.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Trade secrets:</E> A trade secret is a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. A direct relationship is necessary between the trade secret and the productive process.</P>
          <P>(2) Commercial or financial information, obtained from a person, and is privileged or confidential.</P>
          <P>(i) Information is “commercial or financial” if it relates to businesses, commerce, trade, employment, profits, or finances (including personal finances).</P>
          <P>(ii) Information is obtained from someone outside the Federal Government or from someone within the Government who has a commercial or financial interest in the information. “Person” includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, state or foreign government, or other organization. Information is not “obtained from a person” if it is generated by BBG or another Federal agency.</P>
          <P>(iii) Information is “privileged” if it would ordinarily be protected from disclosure in civil discovery by a recognized evidentiary privilege, such as the attorney-client privilege, or the work-product privilege. Information may be privileged for this purpose under a privilege belonging to a person outside the Government, unless the providing of the information to the Government rendered the information no longer protectible in civil discovery.</P>
          <P>(iv) Information is “confidential” if it meets one of the following tests:</P>
          <P>(A) Disclosure may impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future;</P>
          <P>(B) Disclosure would substantially harm the competitive position of the person who submitted the information;</P>
          <P>(C) Disclosure would impair other Government interests, such as program effectiveness and compliance; or</P>
          <P>(D) Disclosure would impair other private interests, such as an interest in controlling availability of intrinsically valuable records, which are sold in the market by their owner.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Designation of certain confidential information.</E> A person who submits records to the Government may designate part or all of the information in such records as exempt from disclosure under Exemption four. The person may make this designation either at the time the records are submitted to the Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must be in writing. The legend prescribed by a request for proposal or request for quotations according to any agency regulation establishing a substitute for the language is sufficient but not necessary for this purpose. Any such designation will expire ten years after the records were submitted to the Government.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Predisclosure notification.</E> The procedures in this paragraph apply to records that were submitted to the Government and where we have substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt under Exemption four. Certain exceptions to these procedures are stated in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>
          <P>(i) When we receive a request for such records and we determine that we may be required to disclose them, we will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts. The notice will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If we must notify a large number of submitters, we may do this by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of it.</P>
          <P>(ii) The submitter has ten (10) working days from receipt of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases for its objections.</P>

          <P>(iii) We will give consideration to all bases that have been timely stated by the submitter. If we decide to disclose the records and the submitter still does <PRTPAGE P="94"/>not agree, we will send a written notice to the submitter stating briefly why we did not sustain its objections and we will provide a copy of the records as we intend to release them. The notice will state that we will disclose the records five (5) working days after the submitter receives the notice unless we are ordered by a United States District Court not to release them.</P>
          <P>(iv) When a requester files suit under the FOIA to obtain records covered by this paragraph, we will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
          <P>(v) Whenever we send a notice to a submitter under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, we will notify you that we are giving the submitter a notice and an opportunity to object.</P>
          <P>(5) Exceptions to predisclosure notification. The notice requirements in paragraph (d)(4) of this section do not apply in the following situations:</P>
          <P>(i) We decide not to disclose the records;</P>
          <P>(ii) The information has previously been published or made generally available;</P>
          <P>(iii) We have already notified the submitter of previous requests for the same records and have come to an understanding with that submitter about the records;</P>
          <P>(iv) Disclosure is required by a statute other than the FOIA;</P>
          <P>(v) Disclosure is required by a regulation, issued after notice and opportunity for public comment that specifies narrow categories of records that are to be disclosed under the FOIA. In this case a submitter may still designate records as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and in exceptional cases, at our discretion, may follow the notice procedures in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;</P>
          <P>(vi) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this case we will still give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section (although this notice need not explain our decision or include a copy of the records); and</P>
          <P>(vii) We withhold the information because another statute requires its withholding.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemption five—Internal memoranda.</E> This exemption covers internal Government communications and notes that fall within a generally recognized evidentiary privilege. Internal Government communications include an agency's communications with an outside consultant or other outside person, with a court, or with Congress, when those communications are for a purpose similar to the purpose of privileged intra-agency communications. Some of the most common applicable privileges are:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">The deliberative process privilege.</E> This privilege protects predecisional deliberative communications. A communication is protected under this privilege if it was made before a final decision was reached on some question of policy and if it expressed recommendations or opinions on that question. The purpose of this privilege is to prevent injury to the quality of the agency decision making process by encouraging open and frank internal policy discussions, by avoiding premature disclosure of policies not yet adopted, and by avoiding the public confusion that might result from disclosing reasons that were not in fact the ultimate grounds for an agency's decision. This privilege continues to protect pre-decisional documents even after a decision is made. We will release purely factual material in a deliberative document unless that material is otherwise exempt. However, purely factual material in a deliberative document is within this privilege if:</P>
          <P>(i) It is inextricably intertwined with the deliberative portions so that it cannot reasonably be segregated; or</P>
          <P>(ii) It would reveal the nature of the deliberative portions, or</P>
          <P>(iii) Its disclosure would in some other way make possible an intrusion into the decision making process.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Attorney-client privilege.</E> This privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and an employee or agent of the Government where an attorney-client relationship exists (for example, where the lawyer is acting as attorney for the agency and the employee is communicating on behalf of the agency) and where the employee has communicated information to the attorney in confidence in order to obtain legal advice or assistance, <PRTPAGE P="95"/>and/or when the attorney has given advice to the client.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Attorney work product privilege.</E> This privilege protects documents prepared by or for an agency, or by or for its representative (usually BBG attorneys) in anticipation of litigation or for trial. It includes documents prepared for purposes of administrative adjudications as well as court litigation. It includes factual material in such documents as well as material revealing opinions and tactics. The privilege continues to protect the documents even after the litigation is closed.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemption six—Clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</E> We may withhold personnel, medical, and similar files, and personal information about individuals if disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Balancing test.</E> In deciding whether to release records that contain personal or private information about someone else to a requester, we weigh the foreseeable harm of invading that individual's privacy against the public benefit that would result from the release of the information. In our evaluation of requests for records, we attempt to guard against the release of information that might involve a violation of personal privacy by a requester being able to “piece together items” or “read between the lines” information that would normally be exempt from mandatory disclosure.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Information frequently withheld.</E> We frequently withhold such information as home addresses, home telephone numbers, ages, minority group status, social security numbers, individual's benefits, earning records, leave records, etc.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Exemption seven—Law enforcement.</E> We are not required to release information or records that the Government has compiled for law enforcement purposes. The records may apply to actual or potential violations of either criminal or civil laws or regulations. We can withhold these records only to the extent that releasing them would cause harm in at least one of the following situations:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Enforcement proceedings.</E> We may withhold information when release could reasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing law enforcement proceedings, investigations of fraud and mismanagement, employee misconduct, and civil rights violations may fall into this category. In certain cases, we may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records that relate to violations in order not to disclose that an investigation is in progress or may be conducted.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Fair trial or impartial adjudication.</E> We may withhold records when release would deprive a person of a fair trial or an impartial adjudication because of prejudicial publicity.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Personal privacy.</E> We are careful not to disclose information that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. When a name surfaces in an investigation, that person is likely to be vulnerable to innuendo, rumor, harassment, or retaliation.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Confidential sources and information.</E> We may withhold records whose release could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source of information. A confidential source may be an individual; a state, local or foreign Government agency; or any private organization. The exemption applies whether the source provides information under an express promise of confidentiality or under circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred. Also, where the record or information in it has been compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority conducting a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security investigation, the exemption also protects all information supplied by a confidential source. Also protected from mandatory disclosure is any information which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the system of confidentiality that assures a flow of information from sources to investigatory agencies.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Techniques and procedures.</E> We may withhold records reflecting special techniques or procedures of investigation or prosecution not otherwise generally known to the public. In some cases, it is not possible to describe even in general terms those techniques without disclosing the very material to <PRTPAGE P="96"/>be withheld. We may also withhold records whose release would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if this disclosure could reasonably be expected to create a risk that someone could circumvent requirements of law or of regulation.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Life and physical safety.</E> We may withhold records whose disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual. This protection extends to threats and harassment as well as to physical violence.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Exemptions eight and nine—Records on financial institutions and records on wells.</E> (1) Exemption eight permits us to withhold records about regulation or supervision of financial institutions.</P>
          <P>(2) Exemption nine permits the withholding of geological and geophysical information and data, including maps concerning wells.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 503.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Electronic records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> This section applies to all records of the BBG, including all of its worldwide operations. Congress enacted the FOIA to require Federal agencies to make records available to the public through public inspections and at the request of any person for any public or private use. The increase in the Government's use of computers enhances the public's access to Government information. This section addresses and explains how records will be reviewed and released when the records are maintained in electronic format. Documentation not previously subject to the FOIA when maintained in a non-electronic format is not made subject to FOIA by this law.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Compelling need.</E> Obtaining records on an expedited basis because of an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual, or urgently needed by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activities.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Discretionary disclosure.</E> Records or information normally exempt from disclosure will be released whenever it is possible to do so without reasonably foreseeable harm to any interest protected by an FOIA exemption.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Electronic reading room.</E> The room provided which makes electronic records available.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Electronic format of records.</E> (1) Materials such as agency opinions and policy statements (available for public inspection and copying) will be available electronically by accessing the BBG's Home Page via the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.ibb.gov.</E> To set up an appointment to view such records in hard copy or to access the Internet via the BBG's computer, please contact the FOIA/Privacy Act Officer at (202) 260-4404.</P>
          <P>(2) We will make available for public inspection and copying, both electronically via the Internet and in hard copy, those records that have been previously released in response to FOIA requests, when we determine the records have been or are likely to be the subject of future requests.</P>
          <P>(3) We will provide both electronically through our Internet address and in hard copy a “Guide” on how to make an FOIA request, and an Index of all Agency information systems and records that may be requested under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(4) We may delete identifying details when we publish or make available the index and copies of previously-released records to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
          <P>(i) We will indicate the extent of any deletions made from the place the deletion was made, if possible.</P>
          <P>(ii) We will not reveal information about deletions if such disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Honoring form or format requests.</E> We will aid requesters by providing records and information in the form requested, including electronic format, if we can readily reproduce them in that form or format. However, if we cannot accommodate you, we will provide responsive, nonexempt information in a reasonably accessible form.</P>

          <P>(1) We will make a reasonable effort to search for records kept in an electronic format. However, if the effort would significantly interfere with the operations of the agency or the agency's use of its computers, we will consider the effort to be unreasonable.<PRTPAGE P="97"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) We need not create documents that do not exist, but computer records found in a database rather than in a file cabinet may require the application of codes or some form of programming to retrieve the information. This application of codes or programming of records will not amount to the creation of records.</P>
          <P>(3) Except in unusual cases, the cost of computer time will not be a factor in calculating the two free hours of search time available under Sec. 503.7. In those unusual cases, where the cost of conducting a computerized search significantly detracts from the agency's ordinary operations, no more than the dollar cost of two hours of manual search time shall be allowed. For searches conducted beyond the first two hours, the agency shall only charge the direct costs of conducting such searches.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Technical feasibility of redacting non-releasable material.</E> We will make every effort to indicate the place on the record where a redaction of non-releasable material is made, and an FOIA citation noting the applicable exemption for the deletion will also be placed at the site. If unable to do so, we will notify you of that fact.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Ensuring timely response to request.</E> We will make every attempt to respond to FOIA requests within the prescribed 20 working-day time limit. However, processing some requests may require additional time in order to properly screen material against the inadvertent disclosure of material covered by the exemptions.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Multitrack first-in first-out processing.</E> (i) Because the agency expects to be able to process its requests without a backlog of cases, BBG will not institute a multitract system. Those cases that may be handled easily, because they require only a few documents or a simple answer, will be handled immediately by an FOIA specialist.</P>
          <P>(ii) If you wish to qualify for faster processing, you may limit the scope of your request so that we may respond more quickly.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> (i) The agency may extend for a maximum of ten working days the statutory time limit for responding to an FOIA request by giving notice in writing as to the reason for such an extension. The reasons for such an extension may include: the need to search for and collect requested records from multiple offices; the volume of records requested; and, the need for consultation with other components within the agency.</P>
          <P>(ii) If an extra ten days still does not provide sufficient time for the Agency to deal with your request, we will inform you that the request cannot be processed within the statutory time limit and provide you with the opportunity to limit the scope of your request and/or arrange with us a negotiated deadline for processing your request.</P>
          <P>(iii) If you refuse to reasonably limit the scope of your request or refuse to agree upon a time frame, the agency will process your case, as it would have, had no modification been sought. We will make a diligent, good-faith effort to complete our review within the statutory time frame.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Grouping of requests.</E> We will group together requests that clearly involve related material that should be considered as a single request.</P>
          <P>(i) If you make multiple or related requests for similar material for the purpose of avoiding costs, we will notify you that we are grouping together your requests, and the reasons why.</P>
          <P>(ii) Multiple or related requests may also be grouped, such as those involving requests and schedules but you will be notified in advance if we intend to do so.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Time periods for agency consideration of requests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Expedited access.</E> We will authorize expedited access to requesters who show a compelling need for access, but the burden is on the requester to prove that expedition is appropriate. We will determine within ten days whether or not to grant a request for expedited access and we will notify the requester of our decision.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Compelling need for expedited access.</E> Failure to obtain the records within an expedited deadline must pose an imminent threat to an individual's life or physical safety; or the request must be made by someone primarily engaged in disseminating information, and who has an urgency to inform the <PRTPAGE P="98"/>public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">How to request expedited access.</E> We will be required to make factual and subjective judgments about the circumstances cited by requesters to qualify them for expedited processing. To request expedited access, your request must be in writing and it must explain in detail your basis for seeking expedited access. The categories for compelling need are intended to be narrowly applied:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">A threat to an individual's life or physical safety.</E> A threat to an individual's life or physical safety should be imminent to qualify for expedited access to the records. You must include the reason why a delay in obtaining the information could reasonably be foreseen to cause significant adverse consequences to a recognized interest.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Urgency to inform.</E> The information requested should pertain to a matter of a current exigency to the American public, where delay in response would compromise a significant recognized interest. The person requesting expedited access under an “urgency to inform,” must be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information. This does not include individuals who are engaged only incidentally in the dissemination of information. “Primarily engaged” requires that information dissemination be the main activity of the requester. A requester only incidentally engaged in information dissemination, besides other activities, would not satisfy this requirement. The public's right to know, although a significant and important value, would not by itself be sufficient to satisfy this standard.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Estimation of matter denied.</E> The agency will try to estimate the volume of any denied material and provide the estimate to the requester, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an exemption.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Computer redaction.</E> The agency will identify the location of deletions in the released portion of the records, and where technologically possible, will show the deletion at the place on the record where the deletion was made, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Annual report on FOIA activities.</E> Reports on FOIA activities are submitted each fiscal year to the Department of Justice, and are due by February 1 of every year. The BBG's report will be available both in hard copy and through the Internet. The Department of Justice will also report all Federal agency FOIA activity through electronic means.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Reference materials and guides.</E> The agency has available in hard copy, and electronically through the Internet, a guide for requesting records under the FOIA, and an index and description of all major information systems of the agency. The guide is a simple explanation of what the FOIA is intended to do, and how you can use it to access BBG records. The Index explains the types of records that may be requested from the Agency through FOIA requests and why some records cannot, by law, be made available by the BBG.</P>

            <P>(a) In any United States federal, state, and local proceeding or administrative action, or proceeding or administrative action conducted in a foreign country, in which the BBG is not a party, no BBG employee shall, in response to a demand or request for official records or information, furnish or produce documents or testimony as to any material contained in BBG files, any information relating to or based upon material contained in BBG files, or any information or material acquired as part of the performance of that person's official duties (or because of that person's official status) without the prior written approval of the General Counsel.</P>

            <P>(a) The purposes of this part are met;</P>
            <P>(b) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;</P>
            <P>(c) Allowing such testimony or production of records would assist or hinder the BBG in performing its statutory duties;</P>
            <P>(d) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of the BBG or the United States;</P>
            <P>(e) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;</P>
            <P>(f) The demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand or request arose;</P>
            <P>(g) Disclosure would violate a statute, Executive Order or regulation;</P>
            <P>(h) Disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive, or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential or financial information, otherwise protected information, or information which would otherwise be inappropriate for release;</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceeding, or compromise constitutional rights or national security interests;</P>
            <P>(j) Disclosure would result in the BBG appearing to favor one litigant over another;</P>
            <P>(k) The request was served before the demand;</P>
            <P>(l) A substantial Government interest is implicated;</P>

            <P>(3) A list of categories of records sought, a detailed description of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony or records sought;</P>
            <P>(4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs any need to maintain the confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on the BBG to produce the records or provide testimony;</P>
            <P>(5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than an BBG employee, such as a retained expert;</P>

            <P>(e) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with the request.</P>
            <P>(f) The request should state that the requester will provide a copy of the BBG employee's statement free of charge and that the requester will permit the BBG to have a representative present during the employee's testimony.</P>

            <P>(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of official records and information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of a confidentiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, the BBG may condition the release of official records and information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) If the General Counsel so determines, original BBG records may be presented for examination in response to a request, but they may not be presented as evidence or otherwise used in a manner by which they could lose their identity as official BBG records, nor may they be marked or altered. In lieu of the original records, certified copies may be presented for evidentiary purposes.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The General Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to the BBG.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees for records.</E> Fees for producing records will include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time will be calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowances, and benefits). Fees for duplication will be the same as those charged by the BBG in its Freedom of Information Act regulations at 22 CFR Part 503.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear and on 28 U.S.C. 1821, as applicable. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, in travel and for attendance in the legal proceeding, plus travel costs.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> A requester must pay witness fees for current BBG employees and any record certification fees by submitting to the General Counsel a check or money order for the appropriate amount made payable to the Treasury of the United States. In the case of testimony of former BBG employees, the requester must pay applicable fees directly to the former BBG employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">De minimis fees.</E> Fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedures for requests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The agency will consider all written requests received from an individual for records pertaining to herself/himself as a request made under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) whether or not the individual specifically cites the Privacy Act when making the request.</P>
          <P>(b) All requests under the Privacy Act should be directed to the FOIA/Privacy Act Office, Office of the General Counsel, Broadcasting Board of Governors, Suite 3349, 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20237, which will coordinate the search of all systems of records specified in the request. Requests should state name, date of birth, and social security number.</P>

          <P>(c) Requests directed to any of the Agency's worldwide establishments which involve routine unclassified, administrative and personnel records available only at those establishments may be released to the individual by the establishment if it determines that such a release is authorized by the Privacy Act. All other requests shall be submitted by the establishment to the <PRTPAGE P="105"/>FOIA/Privacy Act Office, Office of the General Counsel, Broadcasting Board of Governors, Suite 3349, 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20237, and the individual shall be so notified of this section in writing, when possible.</P>
          <P>(d) In those instances where an individual requests records pertaining to herself/himself, as well as records pertaining to another individual, group or some other category of the Agency's records, only that portion of the request which pertains to records concerning the individual will be treated as a Privacy Act request. The remaining portions of such a request will be processed as a Freedom of Information Act request and sent to the office noted in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 505.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Disclosure of information.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In order to locate the system of records that you believe may contain information about you, you should first obtain a copy of the Agency's Notice of Systems of Records. By identifying a particular record system and by furnishing all the identifying information requested by that record system, it would enable us to more easily locate those records which pertain to you. At a minimum, any request should include the information specified in Sec. 505.4(b).</P>
          <P>(b) In certain circumstances, it may be necessary for us to request additional information from you to ensure that the retrieved record does, in fact, pertain to you.</P>
          <P>(c) All requests for information on whether or not the Agency's systems of records contain information about you will be acknowledged within 20 working days of receipt of that request. The requested records will be provided as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Agency determines that the substance of the requested record is exceptionally sensitive, we will require you to furnish a signed, notarized statement that you are in fact the person named in the file before granting access to the records.</P>
          <P>(e) Original records will not be furnished subject to and in accordance with fees established in § 505.11.</P>
          <P>(f) Denial of access to records:</P>
          <P>(1) The requirements of this section do not entitle you access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
          <P>(2) Under the Privacy Act, we are not required to permit access to records if the information is not retrievable by your name or other personal identifier; those requests will be processed as Freedom of Information Act requests.</P>
          <P>(3) We may deny you access to a record, or portion thereof, if following a review it is determined that the record or portion falls within a system of records that is exempt from disclosure according to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and 552a(k). See §§ 505.13 and 505.14 for a listing of general and specific exemptions.</P>
          <P>(4) The decision to deny access to a record or a portion of the record is made by the Agency's Privacy Act Officer. The denial letter will advise you of your right to appeal the denial (See § 505.9 on Access Appeal Committee's review).</P>

          <P>If, in the judgment of the Agency, the release of medical information to <PRTPAGE P="106"/>you could have an adverse effect, the Agency will arrange an acceptable alternative to granting access of such records directly to you. This normally involves the release of the information to a doctor named by you. However, this special procedure provision does not in any way limit your absolute right to receive a complete copy of your medical record.</P>

          <P>(b) Requests for amendments to records must be in writing and mailed or delivered to the FOIA/Privacy Act Officer, FOIA/Privacy Act Office, Office of the General Counsel, Broadcasting Board of Governors, Suite 3349, 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20237, who will coordinate the review of the request to amend the record with the appropriate office(s). Such requests must contain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate the record, a brief description of the item or items of information to be amended, and the reason for the requested change. The requester should submit as much documentation, arguments or other data as seems warranted to support the request for amendment.</P>
          <P>(c) We will review all requests for amendments to records within 20 working days of receipt of the request and either make the changes or inform you of our refusal to do so and the reasons.</P>

          <P>(b) If we agree with you to amend your records, we will:</P>
          <P>(1) Advise you in writing;</P>
          <P>(2) Correct the record accordingly;</P>
          <P>(3) And, to the extent that an accounting of disclosure was maintained, advise all previous recipients of the record of the corrections.</P>
          <P>(c) If we disagree with all or any portion of your request to amend a record, we will:</P>
          <P>(1) Advise you of the reasons for the determination; and</P>

          <P>(a) When we determine to deny a request to amend a record, or portion of the record, you may request further review by the Agency's Access Appeal Committee. The written request for review should be mailed to the Chairperson, Access Appeal Committee, FOIA/Privacy Act Office, Office of the General Counsel, Broadcasting Board of Governors, Suite 3349, 330 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20237. The letter should include any documentation, information or statement, which substantiates your request for review.</P>
          <P>(b) The Agency's Access Appeal Committee will review the Agency's initial denial to amend the record and your documentation supporting amendment, within 30 working days. If additional time is required, you will be notified in writing of the reasons for the delay and the approximate date when the review is expected to be completed. Upon completion of the review, the Chairperson will notify you of the results.</P>
          <P>(c) If the Committee upholds the Agency's denial to amend the record, the Chairperson will advise you of:</P>
          <P>(1) The reasons for our refusal to amend the record;</P>
          <P>(2) Your right and the procedure to add to the file a concise statement supporting your disagreement with the decision of the Agency; and</P>
          <P>(3) Your right to seek judicial review of the Agency's refusal to amend the file.</P>

          <P>(d) When you file a statement disagreeing with our refusal to amend a record, we will clearly annotate the record so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent to anyone who may subsequently have access to, use of, or reason to disclose the file. If information is disclosed regarding the area of dispute, we will provide a copy <PRTPAGE P="107"/>of your statement in the disclosure. Any statement, which may be included by the Agency regarding the dispute, will be limited to the reasons given to you for not amending the record. Copies of our statement shall be treated as part of your record, but will not be subject to amendment by you under these regulations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose of program.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Many individuals in society possess great productive potential which goes unrealized because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard workweek. Permanent part-time employment also provides benefits to other individuals in a variety of ways, such as providing older individuals with a gradual transition into retirement, providing employment opportunities to handicapped individuals or others who require a reduced workweek, providing parents opportunities to balance family responsibilities with the need for additional income, providing employment opportunities for women returning to the workforce and assisting students who must finance their own education or vocational training. In view of this, the Broadcasting Board of Governors will operate a part-time career employment program, consistent with the needs of its beneficiaries and its responsibilities.</P>

          <P>(g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:</P>
          <P>(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,</P>
          <P>(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial on an impartial adjudication,</P>
          <P>(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</P>

          <SUBJECT>When litigation is involved in claim.</SUBJECT>
          <P>If a claimant does not agree to a settlement of a claim of which is considered fair and equitable by the Board's responsible officials, the claimant, upon the final disposition thereof by the Board, may elect to file suit. Relief from claims which are disallowed may be sought by filing suit in the U.S. District Court for the district where the claimant resides or wherein the act of omission complained of occurred. The failure of the Board to make final disposition of a claim within 6 months after it has been filed shall, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672, and at the option of the claimant at any time thereafter, is deemed a final denial of the claim. If a suit is filed against the Government involving the Board, the Department of Justice will request the Board to furnish the complete file on the case.

            <SUBJECT>Demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Prior to initiating administrative offset, demand for payment will be made as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) Written demands will be made promptly upon the debtor in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that further demand would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. In determining the timing of demand letters, Broadcasting Board of Governors will give due regard to the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, debt referrals to the Department of Justice for litigation, where necessary, can be made within one year of the Board's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt. When necessary to protect the Government's interests (e.g., to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring) written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this chapter, including immediate referral for litigation.</P>
            <P>(b) The initial demand letter will inform the debtor of: The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to request review within the Board; the applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and administrative costs (Subpart D of this regulation) and; the date by which payment is to be made, which normally will not be more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter was mailed or hand delivered. Broadcasting Board of Governors will exercise care to insure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they are actually dated.</P>

            <P>(c) As appropriate to the circumstances, Broadcasting Board of Governors will include in the demand letters matters relating to alternative methods of payment, the debtor's rights to representation by his respective bargaining unit, policies relating to referral to collection agencies, the <PRTPAGE P="118"/>Board's intentions relative to referral of the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, and, depending on the statutory authority, the debtor's entitlement to consideration of waiver.</P>
            <P>(d) Broadcasting Board of Governors will respond promptly to communications from the debtor and will advise debtors who dispute the debt that they must furnish available evidence to support their contention.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 512.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Collection by administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Collection by administrative offset will be undertaken in accordance with these regulations on all claims which are liquidated and certain in amount, in every instance where the appropriate Board official determines such collection to be feasible and not otherwise prohibited.</P>
            <P>(1) For purpose of this section, the term <E T="03">administrative offset</E> has the same meaning as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) Whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a determination to be made by the Board on a case-by-case basis, in the exercise of sound discretion. Broadcasting Board of Governors will consider not only the practicalities of administrative offset, but whether such offset is best suited to protect and further all of the Government's interests. Broadcasting Board of Governors will give consideration to the debtor's financial condition, and is not required to use offset in every instance where there is an available source of funds. Broadcasting Board of Governors will also consider whether offset would tend to substantially disrupt or defeat the purpose of the program authorizing the payments against which offset is contemplated.</P>
            <P>(b) Before the offset is made, a debtor shall be provided with the following: written notice of the nature and the amount of the debt and the Board's intention to collect by offset; opportunity to inspect and copy Board records pertaining to the debt; opportunity to obtain review within the Board of the determination of indebtedness; and opportunity to enter into written agreement with the Board to repay the debt. Broadcasting Board of Governors may also make requests to other agencies holding funds payable to the debtor, and process requests for offset that are received from other agencies.</P>
            <P>(1) Broadcasting Board of Governors will exercise sound judgment in determining whether to accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. The determination will weigh the Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor.</P>
            <P>(2) In cases where the procedural requirements specified in this paragraph (b) have previously been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt under some other statutory or regulatory authority, such as pursuant to an audit allowance, the Board is not required to duplicate those requirements before taking administrative offset.</P>
            <P>(3) Broadcasting Board of Governors may not initiate administrative offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect the debt. When the debt first accrued is to be determined according to existent law regarding the accrual of debts (e.g., 28 U.S.C. 2415).</P>
            <P>(4) Broadcasting Board of Governors is not authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716 to use administrative offset with respect to: Debts owed by any State or local Government; debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the tariff laws of the United States; or any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments which are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>

            <P>(5) Broadcasting Board of Governors may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by paragraph (b) of <PRTPAGE P="119"/>this section if failure to take offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt, and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later determined not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded 30 days after the Board has notified the debtor in writing that the debt is not owed. Such written notification will be issued within 15 days after the Board has confirmed through a review of its official records that the debt is not owed.</P>
            <P>(c) Type of hearing or review: (1) For purposes of this section, whenever Broadcasting Board of Governors is required to afford a hearing or review within the Board, the Board will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when: An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Board to consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of veracity; or the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Board determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary type hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collection systems in which determinations of indebtedness or waiver rarely involve issues of veracity and the Board has determined that the review of the written record is ordinarily enough to correct prior mistakes.</P>
            <P>(3) In those cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Board will make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.</P>
            <P>(d) Appropriate use will be made of the cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by administrative offset. Broadcasting Board of Governors will not refuse to initiate administrative offset to collect debts owed the United States, unless the requesting agency has not complied with the applicable provisions of these standards.</P>
            <P>(e) Collection by offset against a judgment obtained against the United States shall be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.</P>
            <P>(f) Whenever the creditor agency is not the agency which is responsible for making the payment against which offset is sought, the latter agency shall not initiate the requested offset until it has been provided by the creditor agency with an appropriate written certification that the debtor owes the debt (including the amount) and that full compliance with the provisions of this section has taken place.</P>
            <P>(g) When collecting multiple debts by administrative offset, Broadcasting Board of Governors will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying particular attention to the applicable statutes of limitations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, Broadcasting Board of Governors may request that monies that are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payments, or a minimal number of payment, debts owed the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials within the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.</P>
            <P>(b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, Broadcasting Board of Governors shall include written statements that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;</P>

            <P>(2) The Broadcasting Board of Governors has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and<PRTPAGE P="120"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The Broadcasting Board of Governors has complied with the requirements of § 512.10 of this part, including any required hearing or review.</P>
            <P>(c) Once Broadcasting Board of Governors decides to request offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.</P>
            <P>(d) If Broadcasting Board of Governors collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, Broadcasting Board of Governors shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) This section does not require or authorize the Office of Personnel Management to review the merits of the Broadcasting Board of Governors determination relative to the amount and validity of the debt, its determination on waiver under an applicable statute, or its determination whether to provide an oral hearing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Collection in installments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Whenever feasible, and except as required otherwise by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties, and administrative costs as required by this regulation, should be collected in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected under administrative offset or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. If Broadcasting Board of Governors agrees to accept payment in installments, it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of the payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and ability to the debtor to pay. If possible the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within 3 years.</P>
            <P>(b) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntary installment plan is to be applied among those debts, the Board will follow that designation. If no such designation is made, the Board will apply payments to the various debts in accordance with the best interest of the United States as as determined by the facts and circumstances of each case, with particular attention to application statutes of limitation.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Format for request for recovery.</E> (1) Upon completion of the procedures prescribed under 5 CFR 550.1104 and its own regulations, the creditor agency shall certify the debt in writing to the paying agency.</P>
            <P>(2) The creditor agency shall certify in writing that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt; the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect first accrued, and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing section 5514 have been approved by OPM.</P>
            <P>(3) If collection must be made in installments, the creditor agency must advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencing date of the first installment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Submitting the request for recovery</E>—(1) <E T="03">Current employees.</E> The creditor agency shall submit the debt claim, agreement, or other instruction on the payment schedule to the employee's paying agency.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Separated employees</E>—(i) <E T="03">Employees who are in the process of separating.</E> If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor agency will submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in §§ 512.22 and 512.23. The paying agency shall certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Where the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, it will send a copy of the certified debt claim to the agency responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. It is the responsibility of the creditor agency for pursuing the claim.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Employees who have already separated.</E> If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the creditor agency may request that monies which are due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801) or other similar funds be administratively offset in order to collect the debt (31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another.</E> If an employee transfers to a position served by a different paying agency subsequent to the creditor agency's debt claim but before complete collection, the paying agency from which the employee separates shall certify the total of collection made on the debt. One copy of the certification will be supplied to the employee, and another to the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer. The original shall be inserted in the employees official personnel folder. The creditor agency shall submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed. The paying agency will then resume collection from the employee's current pay account, and <PRTPAGE P="125"/>notify the employee and the creditor agency of the resumption. The creditor agency will not need to repeat the due process procedure described by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>” Upon settlement or repayment of the debt all records of the debt will be removed from official personnel records.</P>
            <P>(c) Processing the debt claim upon receipt by the paying agency:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Incomplete claims.</E> If the paying agency receives an improperly completed debt certification, it shall return the request with a notice that procedures under 5 CFR 550.1101 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and the creditor agency's own regulations must be completed and a properly completed debt certification form received before action will be taken to effect collection.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Complete claim.</E> If the paying agency receives a properly completed debt form, deductions will begin prospectively at the next officially established pay interval. A copy of the debt form will be given to the debtor along with notice of the date deductions will commence.</P>
            <P>(3) The paying agency is not required or authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assessment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, or § 512.29, Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. Before assessing these charges, Broadcasting Board of Governors will mail or hand deliver a written notice to the debtor. This notice will include a statement of the Board's requirements concerning §§ 512.9 and 512.21.</P>
            <P>(b) Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor, using the most current address available to the Board.</P>

            <P>(c) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury Tax and Loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. The rate of interest as initially assessed shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. However, in cases where the debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks a new agreement, Broadcasting Board of Governors may set a new rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the agreement is executed. Interest will not be assessed on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section.</P>
            <P>(d) Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt. Calculation of administrative costs shall be based upon actual costs incurred. Administrative costs include costs incurred to obtain credit reports in the case of employee debt or in using a private debt collector in the case of non-employee debt.</P>
            <P>(e) Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess a penalty charge not to exceed 6% per year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.</P>
            <P>(f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received shall be applied first to the outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest and third to outstanding principal.</P>

            <P>(g) Broadcasting Board of Governors will waive the collection of interest on the debt or any portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. Broadcasting Board of Governors may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines such action is appropriate. Broadcasting Board of Governors may also waive in whole or in part the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs <PRTPAGE P="126"/>assessed under this section per the criteria specified in part 103 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 103) relating to the compromise of claims or if the Board determines that collection of these charges is not in the best interest of the United States. Waiver under the first sentence of this paragraph is mandatory. Under the second and third sentences, it may be exercised under the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) Waiver of interest pending consideration of a request for reconsideration, administrative review, or waiver of the underlying debt under a permissive statute, and</P>
            <P>(2) Waiver of interest where Broadcasting Board of Governors has accepted an installment plan under § 512.12, there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor and the amount of the interest is large enough, in relation to the size of the installments that the debtor can reasonably afford to pay, that the debt will never be repaid.</P>
            <P>(h) Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which collection must be suspended under § 104.2(c)(1) of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 104).</P>

            <P>(1) To debts owned by any State or local government;</P>
            <P>(2) To debt arising under contracts which were executed prior to, and were in effect on October 25, 1982;</P>
            <P>(3) To debts where an applicable statute, loan agreement, or contract either prohibits such charges or explicitly fixes the charges that apply to the debts arising under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) However Broadcasting Board of Governors is authorized to assess interest and related charges on debts which are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.</P>
            <P>(b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under section 6 of the E.O. by:</P>
            <P>(1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the governmentwide system;</P>
            <P>(2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;</P>
            <P>(3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of “ineligible” in § 513.105), and participants who have voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;</P>
            <P>(4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and</P>
            <P>(5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.</P>
            <P>(c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by—</P>
            <P>(1) Providing for the inclusion in the <E T="03">List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs</E> all persons proposed for debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons determined to be ineligible; and</P>
            <P>(2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.</P>
            <P>(d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.</P>

            <P>(a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of these regulations such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions.”</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Covered transaction.</E> For purposes of these regulations, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary covered transaction.</E> Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lower tier covered transaction.</E> A lower tier covered transaction is:</P>
            <P>(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction.</P>
            <P>(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered transaction.</P>

            <P>(C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant <PRTPAGE P="130"/>and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Principal investigators.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Providers of federally-required audit services.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The following transactions are not covered:</P>
            <P>(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</P>
            <P>(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;</P>
            <P>(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</P>
            <P>(iv) Federal employment;</P>
            <P>(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;</P>
            <P>(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations would be prohibited by law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Relationship to other sections.</E> This section describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations will apply. Subpart B, “Effect of Action,” 513.200, “Debarment or suspension,” sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities described in 513.110(a). Sections 513.325, “Scope of debarment,” and 513.420, “Scope of suspension,” govern the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Relationship to Federal procurement activities.</E> In accordance with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or suspension under the FAR.</P>

            <P>(a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are appropriate means to implement this policy.</P>
            <P>(b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in these regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Period of debarment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment period.</P>
            <P>(1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of the requirements of subpart F of this part generally should not exceed three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment may be imposed.</P>

            <P>(b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of §§ 513.311 through 513.314 shall be followed to extend the debarment.</P>
            <P>(c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Newly discovered material evidence;</P>
            <P>(2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the debarment was based;</P>
            <P>(3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;</P>
            <P>(4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or</P>
            <P>(5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.</P>

            <P>(a)(1) As a prior condition of being awarded a grant, each grantee shall make the appropriate certification to the Federal agency providing the grant, as provided in appendix C to this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-automatic continuation of such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.</P>
            <P>(c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central location for submission.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.</P>
            <P>(2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central location for submission.</P>
            <P>(3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those located in other State agencies.</P>

            <P>(e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon as possible, but <PRTPAGE P="141"/>in any case by a date prior to the date on which performance is expected to be completed.</P>
            <P>(2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days after award.</P>
            <P>(3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy statement and program shall be in place.</P>

            <P>(a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:</P>
            <P>(1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.</P>
            <P>(2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was convicted.</P>
            <P>(i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>
            <P>(b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.</P>

            <P>1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary participant is providing the certification set out below.</P>
            <P>2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with the department or Board's determination whether to enter into this transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person from participation in this transaction.</P>
            <P>3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or Board determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or Board may terminate this transaction for cause or default.</P>
            <P>4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate written notice to the department or Board to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</P>

            <P>8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.</P>
            <P>9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</P>
            <P>10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or Board may terminate this transaction for cause or default.</P>

            <P>2. The certification set out below is a material representation of fact upon which reliance is placed when the Board awards the grant. If it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the Board, in addition to any other remedies available to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-Free Workplace Act.</P>

            <P>5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on file in its office and make the information available for Federal inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.</P>

            <P>(a) Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, “substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.” Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.<PRTPAGE P="150"/>

            <P>(b) Public Notice and Priority Setting. Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.</P>

The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, “Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.”</P>

              <P>(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.</P>
              <P>(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following.</P>
              <P>(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in § 19.52. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.</P>
              <P>(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.</P>
              <P>(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.</P>
              <P>(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.</P>
              <P>(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, “Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.”</P>
              <P>(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.</P>

              <P>(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.<PRTPAGE P="152"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.</P>
              <P>(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”</P>

              <P>(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:</P>
              <P>(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in section § 518.21.</P>
              <P>(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.</P>
              <P>(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.</P>
              <P>(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.</P>
              <P>(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.</P>
              <P>(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.</P>
              <P>(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.</P>
              <P>(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.</P>
              <P>(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds are not used.</P>

              <P>(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding <PRTPAGE P="153"/>agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.</P>
              <P>(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.</P>
              <P>(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless the conditions in paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Managing Federal Credit Programs.” Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.</P>
              <P>(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.</P>
              <P>(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.</P>
              <P>(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).</P>
              <P>(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless the conditions in paragraphs (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.</P>
              <P>(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.</P>
              <P>(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.</P>
              <P>(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.</P>

              <P>(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be <PRTPAGE P="154"/>authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.</P>
              <P>(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.”</P>
              <P>(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.</P>

              <P>(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.</P>
              <P>(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.</P>
              <P>(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.</P>
              <P>(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.</P>
              <P>(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.</P>
              <P>(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.</P>
              <P>(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.</P>
              <P>(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.</P>
              <P>(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.</P>
              <P>(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.</P>

              <P>(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not <PRTPAGE P="155"/>exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.</P>
              <P>(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if the conditions in paragraphs (g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.</P>
              <P>(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges.</P>
              <P>(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.</P>

              <P>(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.</P>
              <P>(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.</P>
              <P>(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.</P>
              <P>(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.</P>
              <P>(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties.</P>
              <P>(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.</P>
              <P>(ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.</P>

              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following.</P>
              <P>(1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.</P>
              <P>(2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.</P>

              <P>(d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 518.14.</P>

              <P>(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to <PRTPAGE P="156"/>the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.</P>
              <P>(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.</P>
              <P>(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See §§ 518.30 through 518.37).</P>
              <P>(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.</P>

              <P>(6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,” OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,” or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,” or 48 CFR part 31, “Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,” as applicable.</P>
              <P>(7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.</P>
              <P>(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.</P>
              <P>(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.</P>
              <P>(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following:</P>

              <P>(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award <PRTPAGE P="157"/>or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).</P>
              <P>(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances.</P>
              <P>(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.</P>
              <P>(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.</P>
              <P>(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.</P>
              <P>(4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies.</P>
              <P>(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.</P>
              <P>(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section, do not require prior approval.</P>
              <P>(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whether the conditions in paragraphs (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.</P>
              <P>(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.</P>
              <P>(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in § 518.27</P>
              <P>(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.</P>
              <P>(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.</P>
              <P>(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.</P>
              <P>(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.</P>
              <P>(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.</P>

              <P>Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.</P>

              <P>(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and <PRTPAGE P="159"/>shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Federal awarding agencies.</P>
              <P>(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions.</P>
              <P>(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.</P>
              <P>(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</P>
              <P>(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Federally-owned and exempt property.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Federally-owned property. (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.</P>

              <P>(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, “Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.”) Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is “exempt property.” Should a Federal awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.</P>

              <P>(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long <PRTPAGE P="160"/>as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.</P>
              <P>(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order or priority:</P>
              <P>(1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project, then</P>
              <P>(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.</P>
              <P>(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.</P>
              <P>(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.</P>
              <P>(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the equipment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.</P>
              <P>(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.</P>
              <P>(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).</P>
              <P>(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.</P>
              <P>(viii) Unit acquisition cost.</P>
              <P>(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.</P>
              <P>(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.</P>
              <P>(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.</P>
              <P>(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.</P>

              <P>(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the <PRTPAGE P="161"/>extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</P>
              <P>(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.</P>
              <P>(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.</P>
              <P>(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</P>
              <P>(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.</P>
              <P>(4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.</P>
              <P>(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.</P>

The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.</P>

              <P>(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than <PRTPAGE P="162"/>private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.</P>

              <P>All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.</P>

              <P>(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger <PRTPAGE P="164"/>contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.</P>
              <P>(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.</P>
              <P>(5) Use of services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.</P>

              <P>(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.</P>
              <P>(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a “brand name” product.</P>
              <P>(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.</P>

              <P>(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.</P>
              <P>(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.</P>
              <P>(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.</P>
              <P>(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.</P>
              <P>(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”</P>
              <P>(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in § 518.51(f), performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.</P>
              <P>(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.</P>
              <P>(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following.</P>
              <P>(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both.

              <P>(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report.</P>
              <P>(i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.</P>

              <P>(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports.

              <P>(2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.</P>
              <P>(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.</P>
              <P>(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the “Remarks” section of the report.</P>
              <P>(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the “Remarks” section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.</P>
              <P>(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.</P>
              <P>(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;</P>
              <P>(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or,</P>
              <P>(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.</P>
              <P>(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.</P>
              <P>(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the “Remarks” section of the reports.</P>
              <P>(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in § 518.21, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.</P>
              <P>(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.</P>
              <P>(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.</P>

              <P>(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only exceptions are the following.</P>
              <P>(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.</P>

              <P>(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.</P>
              <P>(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph § 518.53(g).</P>
              <P>(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.</P>
              <P>(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.</P>
              <P>(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.</P>
              <P>(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).</P>
              <P>(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.</P>
              <P>(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.</P>

Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if the conditions in paragraphs (c) (1) or (2) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.</P>
              <P>(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.</P>
              <P>(d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing regulations (see § 518.13).</P>

An event that materially affects the accuracy of the information reported includes:</P>
            <P>(1) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or</P>
            <P>(2) A change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or,</P>

            <FP>Shall file a certification, and a disclosure form, if required, to the next tier above.</FP>

All liability arising from an erroneous representation shall be borne solely by the tier filing that representation and shall not be shared by any tier to which the erroneous representation is forwarded. Submitting an erroneous certification <PRTPAGE P="175"/>or disclosure constitutes a failure to file the required certification or disclosure, respectively. If a person fails to file a required certification or disclosure, the United States may pursue all available remedies, including those authorized by section 1352, title 31, U.S. Code.</P>
            <P>(g) For awards and commitments in process prior to December 23, 1989, but not made before that date, certifications shall be required at award or commitment, covering activities occurring between December 23, 1989, and the date of award or commitment.

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 519.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal <PRTPAGE P="176"/>by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 519.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date.

            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>

          <P>(a) The ALJ shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to determine whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or assessment under § 521.3, and if so, the appropriate amount of any such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or mitigating factors.</P>
          <P>(b) The Broadcasting Board of Governors shall prove defendant's liability and any aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
          <P>(c) The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 521.31</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the Director, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>

          <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that <PRTPAGE P="194"/>may influence the ALJ and the Director in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:</P>
          <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>
          <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;</P>
          <P>(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
          <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;</P>
          <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
          <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
          <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
          <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
          <P>(11) Where the misconduct of employees of agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;</P>
          <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
          <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
          <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and</P>
          <P>(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.</P>
          <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the Director from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.</P>

          <P>(b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition.

Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 521.22(a).</P>
          <P>(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to</P>

          <P>(1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth,<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
          </P>

To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</P>
          <P>(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of:</P>
          <P>(1) A party who is an individual;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated by the party's representative; or</P>

          <P>(c) The ALJ shall exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.</P>
          <P>(d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by consideration of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</P>
          <P>(e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged under Federal law.</P>
          <P>(f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement shall be inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Board shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the Board to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the Board to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

          <P>(3) Require the Board to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Board personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would <PRTPAGE P="202"/>result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Board has the burden of proving that compliance with § 530.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Board head or his or her designee after considering all Board resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Board shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Board may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The Board is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Board, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Board shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 530.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the Board shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 530.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The Board shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Board shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The Board shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Board's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Board shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The Board need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the Board communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the Board to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where Board personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Board has the burden of proving that compliance with § 530.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Board head or his or her designee after considering all Board resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Board shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(e) If the Board receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>
          <P>(f) The Board shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

              <P>This part contains the rules that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (“OPIC”) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552 as amended. These rules should be read together with the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with OPIC's Privacy Act regulations at 22 CFR part 707 as well as under this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>It is OPIC's policy to make its records available to the public to the greatest extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of the FOIA. This policy includes providing reasonably segregable information from records that also contain information that may be withheld under the FOIA. However, implementation of this policy also reflects OPIC's view that the soundness and viability of many of its programs depend in large measure upon full and reliable commercial, financial, technical and business information received from applicants for OPIC assistance and that the willingness of those applicants to provide such information depends on OPIC's ability to hold it in confidence. Consequently, except as provided by law and in this part, information provided to OPIC in confidence will not be disclosed without the submitter's consent.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This part applies to all agency records in OPIC's possession and control. This part does not compel OPIC to <PRTPAGE P="208"/>create records or to ask outside parties to provide documents in order to satisfy a FOIA request. OPIC may, however, in its discretion and in consultation with a FOIA requester, create a new record as a partial or complete response to a FOIA request. In responding to requests for information, OPIC will ordinarily consider only those records within its possession and control as of the date of OPIC's search. If any other date is used, OPIC will inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preservation and transfer of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Preservation of records.</E> OPIC preserves all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this part, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. Records that are identified as responsive to a request will not be disposed of or destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Transfer of records to the National Archives.</E> Under the Records Disposal Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33, OPIC is required to transfer legal custody and control of records with permanent historical value to the National Archives. OPIC's Finance Project and Insurance Contract Case files generally do not qualify as records with permanent historical value. OPIC will not transfer these files except when the National Archives determines that an individual project or case is especially significant or unique. If the National Archives receives a FOIA request for records that have been transferred it will respond to the request in accordance with its own FOIA regulations.</P>

              <P>Records that the FOIA requires agencies to make available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through OPIC's FOIA Web site at <E T="03">www.opic.gov/foia.</E> Records identified as of interest to the public and appropriate for public disclosure are also available, along with an index. These include annual reports and financial statements, program handbooks, press releases, application forms, claims information, and annual FOIA reports. OPIC will review and update its Web site of posted records on an ongoing basis. Persons seeking information are encouraged to visit OPIC's Web site to see what information is already available before submitting a request; OPIC's FOIA Office and FOIA Public Liaison are available to assist individuals in locating records.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requesting non-public re- cords.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General information</E>—(1) <E T="03">How to submit.</E> To make a request for records a requester must submit a written request to OPIC's FOIA Office either by mail to Overseas Private Investment Corporation, 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527 or electronic mail to <E T="03">FOIA@opic.gov.</E> The envelope or subject line should read “Freedom of Information Request” to ensure proper routing. The request is considered received by OPIC upon actual receipt by OPIC's FOIA Office.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Records about oneself.</E> A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must verify his or her identity by providing a notarized statement or a statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization, stating that the requester is the person he or she claims to be.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Records about a third party.</E> Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting a notarized authorization signed by that individual, a declaration by that individual made in compliance with the requirements set <PRTPAGE P="209"/>forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, proof of guardianship, or proof that the individual is deceased (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). OPIC may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OPIC personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist OPIC in identifying the requested records, such as the project name, contract number, date or date range, country, title, name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact OPIC's FOIA Office or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If a requester fails to reasonably describe the records sought, OPIC will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the FOIA Office or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, OPIC's response to the request may be delayed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Format.</E> Requests may state a preferred format for released records including electronic formats. The records will be provided in the preferred format if the record is readily reproducible in that format. If you do not state a preference, you will receive any released records in the format most convenient to OPIC.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requester information.</E> Requests must include the requester's name and contact information, such as phone number, email address, or mailing address, to assist OPIC in communicating with them and providing the released records.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Fees.</E> You should state your willingness to pay fees under these regulations or, alternately, your willingness to pay up to a specified limit. If you believe that you qualify for a partial or total fee waiver under 706.24 you should request a waiver and provide justification as required by 706.24. If your request does not contain a statement of your willingness to pay fees or a request for a fee waiver, OPIC will consider your request an agreement to pay up to $25.00 in fees.</P>

              <P>OPIC will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requests: Commercial use requests, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requests, and all other requests. OPIC will inform requesters as to which category their request has been placed into. Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. OPIC will consider requests for fee waiver in accordance with the requirements in § 706.24. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, OPIC may contact a requester for additional information. OPIC will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. OPIC ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 706.21</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Types of fees.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Direct costs are those expenses that OPIC expends in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial-use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as <PRTPAGE P="210"/>the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.</P>
              <P>(b) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.</P>
              <P>(c) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 706.33(c) of this subpart, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
              <P>(d) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 706.22</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Request categories.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A Commercial Use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. OPIC's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.</P>
              <P>(b) An Educational Use request is one made on behalf of an educational institution, defined as any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. OPIC may request verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.</P>
              <P>(c) A Noncommercial Scientific Institution Use request is a request made on behalf of a noncommercial scientific institution, defined as an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use.</P>

              <P>(d) A News Media Request is a request made by a representative of the news media in that capacity. A representative of the news media is defined as any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate <PRTPAGE P="211"/>news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. A request for records that supports the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, OPIC shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.</P>
              <P>(e) All other requests include any requests that do not qualify under one of the above categories.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 706.23</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Fees charged.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, OPIC will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under § 706.24 of this subpart. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, OPIC should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Search.</E> (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees will be charged to all other requests, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section. Fees for time spent searching is properly charged even if no responsive records are located or if all responsive records are determined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
              <P>(ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be as follows: Professional—$13.75; and administrative—$7.50.</P>
              <P>(iii) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new program to locate the requested records. Before incurring such costs, OPIC will notify the requester and the requester must agree to pay.</P>
              <P>(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored at a Federal Records Center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section. OPIC will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, OPIC will provide one copy per request at a cost of $0.10 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other electronic media, OPIC will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, OPIC will charge the direct costs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> Review fees will be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the review conducted by OPIC to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if the appellate authority determines that a particular exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with the re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) No search fees will be charged for educational use requests, noncommercial scientific use requests, or news media requests as defined in Section 706.22.</P>
              <P>(2) Fees charged when OPIC exceeds time limits.</P>

              <P>(i) When OPIC fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search <PRTPAGE P="212"/>fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in (b)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If OPIC has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and OPIC provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional ten days.</P>
              <P>(iii) If OPIC has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, OPIC may charge all applicable fees incurred in processing the request if the following steps are taken:</P>
              <P>(A) OPIC has provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA; and</P>
              <P>(B) OPIC has discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).</P>
              <P>(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
              <P>(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
              <P>(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, OPIC will provide without charge:</P>
              <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The first two hours of search.</P>
              <P>(5) If, after deducting free entitlements, the total fee calculated under this section is $25.00 or less, no fee will be charged.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> (1) When OPIC determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, OPIC will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of fees for search, review, and duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, OPIC will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge, and if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.</P>
              <P>(2) If OPIC notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. OPIC is not required to accept payments in installments.</P>
              <P>(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but OPIC estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the processing of the request will be tolled when OPIC notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. OPIC will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, OPIC's time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.</P>
              <P>(4) OPIC's FOIA Office or FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> Although not required to provide special services, if OPIC chooses to do so as a <PRTPAGE P="213"/>matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> OPIC may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the thirty-first day following the billing date. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by OPIC. OPIC will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> If OPIC reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, OPIC may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. OPIC may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, OPIC will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section OPIC will not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.</P>
              <P>(2) When OPIC determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. OPIC may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.</P>
              <P>(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within thirty calendar days of the billing date, OPIC may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request. OPIC may also require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before OPIC begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where OPIC has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.</P>
              <P>(4) In cases in which OPIC requires advance payment, OPIC's response time will be tolled and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within thirty calendar days after the date of OPIC's fee letter, OPIC may administratively close the request.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, OPIC will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 706.24</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the interest of the requester.</P>

              <P>(b) OPIC will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, <PRTPAGE P="214"/>that the factors described in paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this section are satisfied.</P>
              <P>(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
              <P>(2) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
              <P>(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as his or her ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall ordinarily be presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.</P>
              <P>(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, OPIC will consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) OPIC shall identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there is a commercial interest, OPIC will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. OPIC will ordinarily presume that when a news media requester has satisfied factors in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
              <P>(c) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.</P>
              <P>(d) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to OPIC and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 706.30</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The OPIC President and CEO or designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultation, referral, and coordination.</E> When reviewing records responsive to a request, OPIC will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, OPIC will proceed in one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> When records originated with OPIC, but contain within <PRTPAGE P="215"/>them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, OPIC will typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Referral.</E> (i) When OPIC believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, OPIC will typically refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if OPIC and the originating agency jointly agree that OPIC is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whenever OPIC refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if in responding to a request for records on a living third party, OPIC locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if OPIC locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, OPIC should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by OPIC.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Classified information.</E> On receipt of any request involving a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, OPIC must refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever OPIC's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), OPIC must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</E> All consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</E> OPIC may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 706.31</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> OPIC ordinarily will process requests according to their order of receipt within their appropriate track under paragraph (b) of this section. The response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the FOIA Office, but in any event not later than ten working days after the request is first received by OPIC. Any time tolled under subparagraph (c) of this section does not count against OPIC's response time.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> OPIC has a track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. Non-expedited requests will be placed into a “simple” or <PRTPAGE P="216"/>“complex” track based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. OPIC will consider the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. OPIC will advise the requester into which track the request falls and, when appropriate, will offer requesters the opportunity to narrow or modify the request so that it can be placed in a different track.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tolling of response time.</E> OPIC may toll its response time once to seek clarification of a request in accordance with § 706.11(b) or as needed to resolve fee issues in accordance with §§ 706.22(c) and 706.23(d) of this part. The response time will resume upon OPIC's receipt of the requester's clarification or upon resolution of the fee issue.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> Whenever the statutory time limits for processing cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances” as defined in the FOIA, and OPIC extends the time limits on that basis, OPIC will notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which OPIC estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten working days, the requester will be provided an opportunity to modify the request or agree to an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. OPIC will make its FOIA Office and its FOIA Public Liaison available for this purpose and will notify the requester of the availability of the Office of Government Services (OGIS) dispute resolution services.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, OPIC may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. OPIC will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
              <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
              <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
              <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time.</P>
              <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. OPIC may waive the formal certification requirement in its administrative discretion.</P>
              <P>(4) OPIC shall notify the requester within ten calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If OPIC denies expedited processing, any appeal of that decision which complies with the procedures set forth in § 706.34 of this subpart shall be acted on expeditiously.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> To the extent practicable, OPIC will communicate electronically with requesters who have access to the internet.<PRTPAGE P="217"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acknowledgments of requests.</E> If a request will take longer than ten days to process, OPIC will send the requester an acknowledgment letter that assigns the request an individualized tracking number. The letter will include a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of requests.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> OPIC will notify the requester in writing if it makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part. The notice will inform the requester of any fees charged under § 706.22 of this part and of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance. OPIC will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests.</E> OPIC will notify the requester in writing if it makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Content of denial letter.</E> The denial letter will be signed by the person responsible for the denial, and will include:</P>
              <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
              <P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemptions applied;</P>
              <P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, for example, by providing the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimation is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
              <P>(4) A brief description of the types of information withheld and the reasons for doing so. A description and explanation are not required if providing it would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
              <P>(5) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Section 706.34(a) of this subpart, and a description of the appeal requirements;</P>
              <P>(6) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from OPIC's FOIA Public Liaison and dispute resolution services offered by OGIS; and</P>
              <P>(7) Notice of any fees charged under § 706.23 of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Markings on released documents.</E> Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. If technically feasible, the location of the information deleted will be indicated on the record.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of record exclusions.</E> (1) In the event that OPIC identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the agency will confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy, to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.</P>
              <P>(2) OPIC will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by the agency from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Exemption 4 protects certain:</P>
              <P>(i) Trade secrets as defined under FOIA law; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential as defined under FOIA law.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial <PRTPAGE P="218"/>information to the Federal government, directly or indirectly.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> All submitters may designate, by appropriate markings, any portions of their submissions that they consider to be protected from disclosure under the FOIA. These markings will be considered by OPIC in responding to a FOIA request but such markings (or the absence of such markings) will not be dispositive as to whether the marked information is ultimately released. Unless otherwise requested and approved these markings will be considered no longer applicable ten years after submission or five years after the close of the associated project, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">When notice to submitters is required.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, OPIC's FOIA Office will use reasonable efforts to notify a submitter in writing whenever:</P>
              <P>(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as confidential commercial information protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
              <P>(ii) OPIC has reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.</P>
              <P>(2) This notification will describe the nature and scope of the request, advise the submitter of its right to submit written objections in response to the request, and provide a reasonable time for response. The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include copies of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:</P>
              <P>(1) OPIC determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;</P>
              <P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or</P>
              <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, OPIC will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) OPIC will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above.</P>
              <P>(2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide OPIC with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In setting forth such grounds, the submitter should explain the basis of its belief that the nondisclosure of any item of information requested is mandated or permitted by law. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as a basis for nondisclosure, the submitter shall explain why the information is considered a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential as defined under FOIA law.</P>
              <P>(3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. OPIC is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>

              <P>(4) The period for providing OPIC with objections to disclosure of information may be extended by OPIC upon receipt of a written request for an extension from the submitter. Such written request shall set forth the date upon which any objections are expected to be completed and shall provide reasonable justification for the extension. In its discretion, OPIC may permit more than one extension.<PRTPAGE P="219"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Analysis of objections.</E> OPIC will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondislosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> If OPIC decides to disclosure information over the objection of a submitter, OPIC will notify the submitter of its determination at least five working days prior to release of the information. The notification will include:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the information to be disclosed, or a copy thereof; and</P>
              <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a FOIA lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, OPIC will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Requester notification.</E> OPIC will notify a requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Administrative appeals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for making an appeal.</E> A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to OPIC's Vice President and General Counsel at <E T="03">FOIA@opic.gov</E> or 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in Section 706.06(c) of this subpart. The requester must make the appeal in writing and it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within ninety calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify OPIC's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. The requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjudication of appeals.</E> OPIC's Vice President and General Counsel or his/her designee will render a written decision within twenty working days after the date of OPIC's receipt of the appeal, unless an extension of up to ten working days is deemed necessary due to unusual circumstances. The requester will be notified in writing of any extension.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on appeals.</E> A decision that upholds the initial determination will contain a written statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied, and will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and the ability to request dispute resolution from the Office of Government Information Services. If an initial determination is remanded or modified on appeal the requester will be notified in writing. OPIC's FOIA Office will then process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester. If an appeal is granted in whole or in part, the information will be made available promptly, provided the requirements of Section 706.23 regarding payment of fees are satisfied.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS.</E> Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If OPIC agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> Before seeking court review, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for access to or copies of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">How to submit.</E> An individual may request access to or copies of records maintained by OPIC that are retrieved by an individual's personal identifier. To make a request for records a requester must submit a written request to the Director of Human Resources Management either by mail or delivery <PRTPAGE P="221"/>to Overseas Private Investment Corporation, 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527 or electronic mail to <E T="03">Privacy@opic.gov.</E> The envelope or subject line should read “Privacy Act Request” to ensure proper routing. Access to records maintained by OPIC will be provided only by appointment. No officer or employee of OPIC shall provide an individual with any records under this part until a written request as described in paragraph (b) of this section is provided and the identity of the individual is verified as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b<E T="03">) Information to include.</E> All requests under this section must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be in writing and be signed by the requester. Unless the requester is a current officer or employee of OPIC, the letter must also be duly acknowledged before a notary public or other authorized public official or signed under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide information sufficient to verify the identity of the requester, including the requester's full name, current address, date of birth, place of birth, or the system of record identification name or number. Also include a clearly legible copy of a valid form of identification. If the request is being made by a parent or guardian on behalf of another, also include the same information for the individual who is the subject of the request along with a court order, birth certificate, or similar document proving the guardianship. OPIC will review the sufficiency of identity evidence under paragraph (c) of this section;</P>

              <P>(3) Provide information sufficient to accurately identify the records or information so that OPIC staff can locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. At minimum this should include the full name, the system of record identification name, or the system identification number for the individual who is the subject of the records. Provision of a social security number is optional. If possible, also include a description of the records as well as providing a record creation time range and the name of the systems that should be searched. A description of OPIC's system of records can be located in the “Privacy Act Compilation” published by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register. Each system of records is also published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
              <P>(4) Specify whether the individual wishes access to or copies of the information pertaining to him. If access is requested, provide at least one preferred date and hour for which an appointment is requested during regular business hours as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. OPIC encourages appointments to be made at least one week in advance and for a requester to provide at least three preferred appointment times; and</P>
              <P>(5) Include an agreement to pay fees or an agreement to pay fees up to a specified amount under § 707.27. A request that does not include an agreement to pay fees will be considered an agreement to pay fees up to $25.00.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> Prior to providing any requested information about an individual, the Director of Human Resources Management shall verify the identity of the individual. If the requester is acting as the guardian of the individual who is the subject of the records, the Director will also verify the identity of the individual who is the subject of the records, the relationship between the requester and the subject individual, and that the requester is acting on behalf of the subject individual. In order to verify identity, the Director shall require the individual to provide reasonable proof of identity such as a valid driver's license, identification card, passport, employee identification card, or any other identifying information. The Director shall deny any request where she determines, at her sole discretion, that the evidence offered to verify the identity of an individual is insufficient to conclusively establish the identity of the individual.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Release of records.</E> Originals and record copies will not be released from the files of OPIC. Individuals will not be permitted to disturb any record files or to remove records from designated place of examination. If copies were requested in the request letter, copies <PRTPAGE P="222"/>will be furnished upon payment of the fees prescribed in § 707.27.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Denial of request.</E> If the Director of Human Resources Management declines any request submitted under this section, the denial will be made in writing and contain a brief description of the denial. Denials include a determination that an individual has not provided adequate evidence to verify identity under paragraph (c) of this section, a determination that the record cannot be located, and a withholding of a record in whole or in part. In the event of a denial, the requester may file a written appeal within thirty days of the date of notification, following the procedures in § 707.25.</P>

The request must be in writing, labeled “Privacy Act Request,” and should be addressed to the Director of Human Resources Management. The request may either be mailed to OPIC or delivered to the receptionist at 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527, during regular business hours, between 8:45 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays.

Also include a clearly legible copy of a valid form of identification. If the request is being made by a parent or guardian on behalf of another, also include the same information for the individual who is the subject of the request along with a court order, birth certificate, or similar document proving the guardianship. OPIC will review the sufficiency of identity evidence under paragraph (c) of this section;</P>

              <P>(3) Provide information sufficient to accurately identify each record so that OPIC staff can locate the record and information with a reasonable amount of effort. At minimum this should include the full name, the system of record identification name, or the system record identification number for the individual who is the subject of the records and the name for each system that you believe the record is located in. Provision of a social security number is optional. If possible, you should also include a description of the records and provide a record creation <PRTPAGE P="223"/>time range. A description of OPIC's systems of records can be located in the “Privacy Act Compilation” published by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register.

              <P>(5) Detail the basis for the requester's belief that the records and information are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. This includes providing substantial and reliable evidence sufficient to permit OPIC to determine whether an amendment is in order.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> Prior to amending information about an individual, the Director of Human Resources Management shall verify the identity of the requesting individual. If the requester is acting as the guardian of the individual who is the subject of the records, the Director will also verify the identity of the individual who is the subject of the records, the relationship between the requester and the subject individual, and that the requester is acting on behalf of the subject individual. In order to verify identity, the Director shall require the individual to provide reasonable proof of identity such as a valid driver's license, identification card, passport, employee identification card, or any other identifying information. The Director shall deny any request where she determines, at her sole discretion, that the evidence offered to verify the identity of an individual is insufficient to conclusively establish the identity of the individual.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of request.</E> If a request will take longer than ten (10) business days to process, OPIC will send the requester an acknowledgment letter. Any request that Director of Human Resources Management determines does not describe records or information in enough detail to permit the staff to promptly locate the records; does not describe the correction requested in enough detail to permit the staff to make a correction; or does not reasonably specify the amendment requested or its basis will be returned without prejudice to the requester and treated as not received.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination.</E> The Director of Human Resources Management will provide a determination on a request under this section within thirty (30) days from receipt.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Amendment.</E> The Director of Human Resources Management will notify the requester in writing if the amendment is made and provide the individual an opportunity to request a copy of the amended record.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Denial.</E> The Director of Human Resources Management will notify the requester in writing if she denies any portion of a request made under this section. The denial will include a brief explanation of the reason for the refusal and the right of the individual to file an appeal within thirty (30) days, following the procedures in § 707.25. In the event an appeal is denied, a requester may file a statement of disagreement with OPIC as described in § 707.25(c).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification of amendment.</E> Within thirty (30) days of the amendment or correction of a record or the filing of a statement of disagreement, OPIC will notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made. If an individual has filed a statement of disagreement, OPIC will attach a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed in the future and may also attach a concise statement of its reasons for denying the request to amend or correct.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of the Government in the Sunshine Act. This part applies to the deliberations of a quorum of the Directors of the Corporation required to take action on behalf of the Corporation where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Corporation business, but does not apply to deliberations to take action to open or close a meeting or to release or withhold information under § 708.5. Any deliberation to which this part applies is hereinafter in this part referred to as a meeting of the Board of Directors.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Open meeting policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is the policy of the Corporation to provide the public with the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking process of the Board of Directors of the Corporation while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Corporation to carry out its responsibilities. In order to effect this policy, every meeting of the Board of Directors shall be open to public observation and will only be closed to public observation if justified under one of the provisions of § 708.5. The public is invited to observe and listen to all meetings of the Board of Directors, or portions thereof, open to public observation, but may not participate or record any of the discussions by means of electronic or other devices or cameras. Documents being considered at meetings of the Board of Directors may be obtained subject to the procedures and exemptions set forth in part 706 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) Directors of the Corporation shall not jointly conduct or dispose of agency business other than in accordance with this part. This prohibition shall not prevent Directors from considering individually business that is circulated to them sequentially in writing.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary of the Corporation shall be responsible for assuring that ample space, sufficient visibility, and adequate acoustics are provided for public observation of meetings of the Board of Directors.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scheduling of a meeting.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A decision to hold a meeting of the Board of Directors should be made as provided in the By-laws of the Corporation and at least eight days prior to the scheduled meeting date in order for the Secretary of the Corporation to give the public notice required by § 708.4. However in special cases, a majority of the Directors may decide to hold a meeting less than eight days prior to the scheduled meeting date if they determine by a recorded vote that Corporation business requires such meeting at such earlier date. After public announcement of a meeting of the Board of Directors under the provisions of § 708.4, the subject matter thereof, or the determination to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, may only be changed if a majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change is possible.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Public announcement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of § 708.5, in the case of each meeting of the Board of Directors, the Secretary shall make public announcement at least one week before the meeting, of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and telephone number of the official designated by the Corporation to respond to requests for information about the meeting. Such announcement shall be made unless a majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that Corporation business requires that such meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case the Secretary shall make public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time.</P>

            <P>(b) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section only if the Secretary publicly announces such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject <PRTPAGE P="228"/>matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Corporation to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement required by this section only if (1) a majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and (2) the Secretary publicly announces such change and the vote of each Director upon such change at the earliest practicable time.</P>
            <P>(c) The <E T="03">earliest practicable time</E>, as used in this subsection, means as soon as possible, which should in few, if any, instances be later than the commencement of the meeting or portion in question.</P>
            <P>(d) The Secretary shall use reasonable means to assure that the public is fully informed of the public announcements required by this section. Such public announcements may be made by posting notices in the public areas of the Corporation's headquarters and mailing notices to the persons on a list maintained for those who want to receive such announcements.</P>

            <P>(e) Immediately following each public announcement required by this section, notice of the time, place, and subject matter of a meeting, whether the meeting is open or closed, any change in one of the preceding announcements, and the name and telephone number of the official designated by the Corporation to respond to requests for information about the meeting shall also be submitted by the Secretary for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Closed meetings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Meetings of the Board of Directors will be closed to public observation where the Corporation properly determines, according to the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, that such portion or portions of the meeting or disclosure of such information is likely to:</P>
            <P>(1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and are (ii) in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</P>
            <P>(2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</P>

            <P>(3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552), <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such statute (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
            <P>(4) Disclose the trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;</P>
            <P>(6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would (i) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, (v) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</P>

            <P>(8) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action, except in any instance where the Corporation has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Corporation is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final Corporation action on such proposal; or<PRTPAGE P="229"/>
            </P>
            <P>(9) Specifically concern the Corporation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Corporation of a particular case of formal Corporation adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) Meetings of the Board of Directors shall not be closed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section when the Corporation finds that the public interest requires that they be open.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Action to close a meeting, or portion thereof, pursuant to the exemptions defined in paragraph (a) of this section may be initiated by the President or any Director of the Corporation by presentation of a request for closure to the Board of Directors. The person initiating the request for closure shall give the Board of Directors a statement specifying the extent of the proposed closure, the relevant exemptive provisions and the circumstances pertinent to such request, and how the public interest will be served by closure. Such statement shall also be given to the General Counsel of the Corporation to serve as a basis for the certification the General Counsel may determine can be issued in accordance with § 708.6. The General Counsel's determination shall be given to the Board of Directors. Action to close a meeting, or portion thereof, shall be taken only when a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors votes to take such action. A separate vote of the Board of Directors shall be taken with respect to each meeting of the Board of Directors a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Director participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Corporation close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (a)(5), (a)(6), or (a)(7) of this section, the Corporation, upon request of any one of its Directors, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting.</P>
            <P>(3) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Secretary shall, by the close of the business day next succeeding the day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, make publicly available a full written explanation of the Corporation's action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation. The information required by this subparagraph shall be disclosed except to the extent that it is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) For every meeting of the Board of Directors closed pursuant to § 708.5, the General Counsel of the Corporation shall publicly certify prior to such meeting that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the Secretary as part of the transcript, recording, or minutes required by paragraph (b) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="230"/>

            <P>(b) The Secretary shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, except that in the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to § 708.5(a)(9), the Secretary shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes. Such minutes shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll-call vote (reflecting the vote of each member on the question).

            <P>(a) These regulations are issued under the general powers of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (“OPIC”) and pursuant to section 237(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, added by Pub. L. 95-268. <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> The Board of <PRTPAGE P="231"/>Directors of OPIC has authorized the President of OPIC to issue these regulations and to amend them as the President shall deem appropriate.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> Section 237(1) of that Act states:</P>
              <P>(1) No payment may be made under any insurance or reinsurance which is issued under this title on or after the date of enactment of this subsection for any loss occurring with respect to a project, if the preponderant cause of such loss was an act by the investor seeking payment under this title, by a person possessing majority ownership and control of the investor at the time of the act, or by any agent of such investor or controlling person, and a court of the United States has entered a final judgment that such act constituted a violation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.</P>
              <P>(2) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Corporation shall adopt regulations setting forth appropriate conditions under which any person convicted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 for an offense related to a project insured or otherwise supported by the Corporation shall be suspended, for a period of not more than 5 years, from eligibility to receive any insurance, reinsurance, <PRTPAGE/>guaranty, loan or other financial support authorized by this title.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(b) These regulations prescribe the procedure under which individuals and companies may be suspended, as mandated by section 237(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, from eligibility for OPIC services because of conviction under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-213) of an offense related to an OPIC-supported project.</P>
            <P>(c) The purposes of the suspensions provided herein are to carry out the statutory requirements of Section 237(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to protect the interest of the United States and to foster full and free competition in international commerce.</P>
            <P>(d) The specific provisions of law under which OPIC operates and the general powers conferred on OPIC give OPIC broad discretion in the conduct of its programs. The issuance of these regulations is not to be construed as in any way limiting or derogating from the discretion of OPIC to determine whether or not to support the investment of a particular entity in a particular case.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Cause for suspension of entities from eligibility.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Any entity which has been convicted of an offense related to a project insured or otherwise supported by OPIC may be suspended from eligibility for additional OPIC services for a period of not more than 5 years pursuant to a suspension determination.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 709.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Upon receipt of an application for OPIC services from any entity which OPIC has reason to believe may have been convicted under the Act the OPIC General Counsel shall ascertain whether a conviction has been entered against such entity under the Act and, if so, whether it was entered for an offense related to a project insured or otherwise supported by OPIC. If such an offense is found, the General Counsel shall advise the President of such finding and any known circumstances indicating that suspension would not be in the national interest of the United States. If, after reviewing the submission from the General Counsel, the President determines that national interest considerations are not great enough to preclude suspension, OPIC shall furnish the subject entity with a written notice (1) specifying the offense and stating that suspension for the maximum duration is being considered and (2) inviting the subject entity to submit to OPIC any evidence of facts or circumstances which it deems appropriate to indicate that a suspension should not be imposed or that the duration of the suspension should be less than the maximum. Such notice shall further state that the subject entity must provide such evidence within 30 days of the date of such written notice or any extension of time granted <PRTPAGE P="232"/>in writing by OPIC. The General Counsel shall promptly review any evidence submitted by the subject entity and report his findings and recommendations to the President. The President shall determine whether the subject entity shall be suspended and, if so, the President shall issue a suspension determination specifying the duration of such suspension. Notice of such suspension determination shall be forwarded by registered mail to the subject entity and any entity so notified shall be advised that such suspension may be reduced as provided in section 5(b) or voided as provided in section 8.</P>
            <P>(b) The duration of any suspension may be reduced by the President at any time for good cause, including the submission by the suspended entity of an application for relief, supported by evidence and setting forth appropriate grounds for granting such relief, such as the institution of measures designed to preclude the recurrence of the actions with respect to which the suspension was initially imposed. Notice of each such reduction shall be forwarded to the suspended entity by registered mail.</P>
            <P>(c) The duration of any suspension may be increased by the President at any time for good cause, subject to providing the subject entity with notice and opportunity to submit evidence in accordance with section 5(a). In no event shall any such increase result in a period of suspension exceeding 5 years with respect to any single conviction.</P>

            <P>Factors which the President may consider in setting or amending the duration of any suspension imposed pursuant to these regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Whether the offense with respect to which suspension has been imposed or is being considered was committed with the knowledge or consent of the board of directors or other group or officer or individual responsible for the overall management of the subject entity;</P>
            <P>(b) Whether or not such offense was committed under pressure of extortion, political intervention, or other duress exerted by the government, or any official of the government, of the country in which such offense was committed;</P>
            <P>(c) Quantitative factors relating to the seriousness of the offense, such as the amounts of any improper payments and the frequency with which, and period of time over which, they were made;</P>
            <P>(d) The purpose of any such offense;</P>
            <P>(e) Whether such offense violated the laws of the country in which it was committed;</P>
            <P>(f) The extent to which the offense was related to the establishment or operation of a project supported by OPIC; and</P>
            <P>(g) Any factors relating to the effect of suspension on the national interest of the United States.</P>

            <P>(b) Suspended entities:</P>
            <P>(1) May be retained on the OPIC mailing list only for the purpose of receiving informational mailings;</P>
            <P>(2) May register projects with OPIC but may not submit project applications to OPIC;</P>
            <P>(3) May continue to deal with OPIC with respect to agreements entered with OPIC prior to the suspension and may amend or be granted modifications of such agreements, including loan reschedulings and refinancings;</P>
            <P>(4) May not be invited to participate in OPIC-sponsored investment missions or other similar activities; and</P>

            <P>(5) May not receive indirectly, or beneficially, whether through the purchase of project participations, the use of intermediary entities or other such devices, any OPIC services which they would not be entitled to receive directly, and may not be the beneficiary of financial support advanced by a third party where such support, in turn, is guaranteed or insured by OPIC; provided, however that such suspended entity shall be entitled to all benefits and payments accruing to holders of negotiable instruments guaranteed by <PRTPAGE P="233"/>OPIC and acquired by such suspended entity pursuant to a public offering thereof by the original or any subsequent holder thereof.</P>

            <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 711.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 711.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result <PRTPAGE P="239"/>in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 711.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 711.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>

            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 711.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,</P>
              <P>(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.</P>
              <P>(e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 712.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
              <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>
              <P>(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.</P>

              <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 712.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

              <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
              <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does this part prohibit?</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part prohibits the release of nonpublic records for legal proceedings or the appearance of an OPIC employee to testify in legal proceedings except as provided in this part. Any person possessing nonpublic records may release them or permit their disclosure or release only as provided in this part.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Duty of OPIC employees.</E> (1) If you are an OPIC employee and you are served with a subpoena requiring you to appear as a witness or to produce records, you must promptly notify the Vice-president/General Counsel in the Department of Legal Affairs. The Vice-President/General Counsel has the authority to instruct OPIC employees to refuse to appear as a witness or to withhold nonpublic records. The Vice-President/General Counsel may let an OPIC employee provide testimony, including expert or opinion testimony, if the Vice-President/General Counsel determines that the need for the testimony clearly outweighs contrary considerations.</P>
            <P>(2) If a court or other appropriate authority orders or demands from you expert or opinion testimony or testimony beyond authorized subjects contrary to the Vice-President/General Counsel's instructions, you must immediately notify the Vice-President/General Counsel of the order and then respectfully decline to comply with the order. You must decline to answer questions on the grounds that this part forbids such disclosure. You should produce a copy of this part, request an opportunity to consult with the Vice-President/General Counsel, and explain that providing such testimony without approval may expose you to disciplinary or other adverse action.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duty of persons who are not OPIC employees.</E> (1) If you are not an OPIC employee but have custody of nonpublic records, as defined at § 713.10, and you are served with a subpoena requiring you to produce records or to testify as a witness, you must promptly notify OPIC of the subpoena. Also, you must notify the issuing court or authority and the person or entity for whom the subpoena was issued of the contents of this part. Provide notice to OPIC by sending a copy of the subpoena to the Vice-President/General Counsel, OPIC, 1100 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20527. After reviewing notice, OPIC may advise the issuing court or authority and the person or entity for whom the subpoena was issued that this part applies and, in addition, may intervene, attempt to have the subpoena quashed or withdrawn, or register appropriate objections.</P>
            <P>(2) After you notify the Vice-President/General Counsel of the subpoena, respond to the subpoena by appearing at the time and place stated in the subpoena, unless otherwise directed by the Vice President/General Counsel. Unless otherwise authorized by the Vice-President/General Counsel, decline to produce any records or give any testimony, basing your refusal on this part. If the issuing court or authority orders the disclosure of records or orders you to testify, decline to produce records or testify and advise the Vice-President/General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Penalties.</E> Anyone who discloses nonpublic records or gives testimony related to those records, except as expressly authorized by OPIC or as ordered by a federal court after OPIC has had the opportunity to be heard, may face the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 641 and other applicable laws. Also, former OPIC employees, in addition to <PRTPAGE P="254"/>the prohibition contained in this part, are subject to the restrictions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. 207.</P>

            <P>This part applies if you want to obtain nonpublic records or testimony of an OPIC employee for a legal proceeding. It does not apply to records that OPIC is required to release, records which OPIC discretionarily releases under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), records that OPIC releases to federal or state investigatory agencies, records that OPIC is required to release pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or records that OPIC releases under any other applicable authority.</P>

            <P>To request nonpublic records or the testimony of an OPIC employee, you must submit a written request as described in § 713.4 to the Vice-President/General Counsel of OPIC. If you serve a subpoena on OPIC or an OPIC employee before submitting a written request and receiving a final determination, OPIC will oppose the subpoena on the grounds that you failed to follow the requirements of this part.</P>

            <P>(d) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs the need to maintain the confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on OPIC to produce the records or provide testimony.</P>
            <P>(e) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, such as the requestor's own books and records, other persons or entities, or the testimony of someone other than an OPIC employee, such as retained experts.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When should I make my request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Submit your request at least 45 days before the date you need the records or testimony. If you want your request processed in a shorter time, you must explain why you could not submit the request earlier and why you need such expedited processing. OPIC retains full discretion to grant, deny, or propose a new completion date on any request for expedited processing. If you are requesting the testimony of an OPIC employee, OPIC expects you to anticipate your need for the testimony in sufficient time to obtain it by deposition. The Vice-President/General Counsel may well deny a request for testimony at a legal proceeding unless you explain why you could not have used deposition testimony instead. The Vice-President/General Counsel will determine the location of a deposition, taking into consideration OPIC's interest in minimizing the disruption for an OPIC employee's work schedule and the costs and convenience of other persons attending the deposition.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What will OPIC do with my request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Factors OPIC will consider.</E> OPIC may consider various factors in reviewing a request for nonpublic records or testimony of OPIC employees, including:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether disclosure would assist or hinder OPIC in performing its statutory duties or use OPIC resources unreasonably, including whether responding to the request will interfere with OPIC employees' ability to do their work.</P>
            <P>(2) Whether disclosure is necessary to prevent the perpetration of a fraud or other injustice in the matter.</P>
            <P>(3) Whether you can get the records or testimony you want from sources other than OPIC.</P>
            <P>(4) Whether the request is unduly burdensome.</P>
            <P>(5) Whether disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, or regulation, such as the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a.</P>
            <P>(6) Whether disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential commercial or financial information, or would otherwise be inappropriate for release and, if so, whether a confidentiality agreement or protective order as provided in § 713.9(a) can adequately limit the disclosure.</P>
            <P>(7) Whether the disclosure would interfere with law enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, or hamper OPIC programs or other OPIC operations.</P>
            <P>(8) Whether the disclosure could result in OPIC's appearing to favor one litigant over another.</P>
            <P>(9) Any other factors OPIC determines to be relevant to the interests of OPIC.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of your request.</E> OPIC will process your request in the order it is received. OPIC will try to respond to your request within 45 days, but this may vary, depending on the scope of your request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> the Vice-President/General Counsel makes the final determination on requests for nonpublic records or OPIC employee testimony. All final determinations are in the sole discretion of the Vice-President/General Counsel. The Vice-President/General Counsel will notify you and the court or other authority of the final determination of your request. In considering your request, the Vice-President/General Counsel may contact you to inform you of the requirements of this part, ask that the request or subpoena be modified or withdrawn, or may try to resolve the request or subpoena informally without issuing a final determination.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 713.8</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>If my request is granted, what fees apply?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> You must pay any fees associated with complying with your request, including copying fees for records and witness fees for testimony. The Vice-President/General Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the fees.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees for records.</E> You must pay all fees for searching, reviewing and duplicating records produced in response to your request. The fees will be the same as those charged by OPIC under its Freedom of Information Act regulations, 22 CFR Part 706, Subpart B, § 706.26.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> Your must pay the fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules for attendance by a witness. If no such fees are prescribed, the local federal district court rule concerning witness fees, for the federal district court closest to where the witness appears, will apply. For testimony by current OPIC employees, you must pay witness fees, allowances, and expenses to the Vice-President/General Counsel by check made payable to the “Overseas Private Investment Corporation” within 30 days from receipt of OPIC's billing statement. For the testimony of a former OPIC employee, you must pay witness fees, allowances, and expenses directly to the former employee, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification of records.</E> OPIC may authenticate or certify records to facilitate their use as evidence. If you require authenticated records, you must request certified copies at least 45 days before the date they will be needed. <PRTPAGE P="256"/>Send your request to the Vice-President/General Counsel. OPIC will charge you a certification fee of $5.00 per document.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver of fees.</E> A waiver or reduction of any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification or authentication of records may be granted in the discretion of the Vice-President/General Counsel. Waivers will not be granted routinely. If you request a waiver, your request for records or testimony must state the reasons why a waiver should be granted.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 713.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>If my request is granted, what restrictions may apply?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Records.</E> The Vice-President/General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of nonpublic records, including a requirement that you obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement with the other parties in the legal proceeding that limits access to and any further disclosure of the nonpublic records. The terms of a confidentiality agreement or protective order must be acceptable to the Vice-President/General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, OPIC may condition the release of nonpublic records on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Testimony.</E> The Vice-President/General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the testimony of OPIC employees, including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring you and the other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that the transcript of the testimony will be kept under seal or will only be used or made available in the particular legal proceeding for which you requested the testimony. The Vice-President/General Counsel may also require you to provide a copy of the transcript of the testimony to OPIC at your expense.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Legal proceedings</E> means any matter before any federal, state or foreign administrative or judicial authority, including courts, agencies, commissions, boards, grand juries, or other tribunals, involving such proceedings as lawsuits, licensing matters, hearings, trials, discovery, investigations, mediation or arbitration. When OPIC is a party to a legal proceeding, it will be subject to the applicable rules of civil procedure governing production of documents and witnesses; however testimony and/or production of documents by OPIC employees, as defined, will still be subject to this part.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Nonpublic records</E> means any OPIC records which are exempt from disclosure by statute or under Part 706, OPIC's regulations implementing the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. For example, this may include records created in connection with OPIC's receipt, evaluation and action on actual and proposed OPIC finance projects and insurance policies (whether such projects or policies were cancelled or not), including all reports, internal memoranda, opinions, interpretations, and correspondence, whether prepared by OPIC employees or by persons under contract, as well as confidential business information submitted by parties seeking to do business with OPIC. Whether OPIC has actually chosen in practice to apply any exemption to specific documents is irrelevant to the question of whether they are “nonpublic” for the purposes of this Part.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">OPIC employee</E> means current and former officials, members of the Board of Directors, officers, directors, employees and agents of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, including contract employees, consultants and their employees. This definition does not include persons who are no longer employed by OPIC and are retained or hired as expert witnesses or agree to testify about general matters, matters available to the public, or matters with which they had no specific involvement or responsibility during their employment.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Subpoena</E> means any order, subpoena for records or other tangible things or for testimony, summons, notice or legal process issued in a legal proceeding.</P>
            <P>

          <P>(a) Upon the initiation of a case, the executive secretary shall ascertain from the Agency, the grievant/charged employee and any labor organization which has been certified as the exclusive representative of employees of the Agency, whether the relevant position occupied by the grievant/charged employee is part of the bargaining unit for which the labor organization is the exclusive representative. If a substantial dispute exists as to whether that position is part of the bargaining unit, and if the Board determines that resolution of that dispute is necessary for determining the status of the labor organization in a case, the Board shall notify the parties and the labor organization, who may request the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board to make a final determination of that dispute. If the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board determines that the grievant or charged employee is a member of a bargaining unit represented by an exclusive representative, the executive secretary shall promptly send a copy of the papers filed with the Board to the exclusive representative.</P>
          <P>(b) The exclusive representative has the right to intervene as a party to the case if such exclusive representative gives timely notice to the Board in writing of its decision to intervene as a party. Notice shall be considered to be timely if given prior to or at the prehearing conference, or, in a case to be decided under part 907 of this chapter, if given within 10 days of receipt of a notice from the Board of the Board's intent to close the record of proceedings.</P>
          <P>(c) An exclusive representative which has not intervened under paragraph (b) of this section may be permitted to intervene as a party upon written application. In ruling upon the application, the Board shall consider whether granting the application will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and may place conditions on the exclusive representative's participation to avoid such delay or prejudice.</P>

          <P>(2) the Board may request access to any other Agency record which the Board determines may be relevant and material to the case.</P>
          <P>(3) An Agency shall make available to the Board any Agency record requested under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section unless the head or deputy head or such Agency personally certifies in writing to the Board that disclosure of the record to the Board and the parties would adversely affect the foreign policy or national security of the United States or that such disclosure is prohibited by law. If such a certification is made with respect to any record, the Agency shall supply to the Board a summary or extract of such record unless the reasons specified in the preceding sentence preclude such a summary or extract.</P>
          <P>(c) If the Board determines that an Agency record, or a summary or extract of a record, made available to the Board under paragraph (b) of this section is relevant and material to the case, the Agency concerned shall make such record, summary, or extract, as the case may be, available to the parties.</P>
          <P>(d) In considering a case, the Board may take into account the fact that the parties or the Board were denied access to any Agency record which the Board determines is or may be relevant and material to the case.</P>

          <P>(a) If an Agency, in its final review, has questioned whether a complaint constitutes a grievance, the Board will make a preliminary determination of its jurisdiction unless the Board concludes that resolution of the question of jurisdiction should be deferred until the Board has compiled a record of proceedings or held a hearing on the merits of the case.</P>
          <P>(b) The Board may also make a preliminary determination on any question raised by a Party concerning the timeliness of a grievance, the election of other remedies under § 904.3, or any other issue whose resolution might avoid the necessity of further proceedings.</P>
          <P>(c) Before making a preliminary determination under this section, the Board shall obtain the views of the other parties and transmit those views to all parties.</P>

This provision shall not apply to grievants who have filed a prohibited personnel practice charge before the Special Counsel for the Merit Systems Protection Board.</P>
          <P>(b) If a grievant is not prohibited from filing a grievance under paragraph (a) of this section, the grievant may file with the Board a grievance which is also eligible for consideration, resolution, and relief as a prohibited personnel practice complaint under the provisions of law relating to the Merit Systems Protection Board or Special Counsel, or under a regulation or executive order.

Notwithstanding such suspension of action, the head of the agency concerned or a chief of mission or principal officer may exclude the Grievant from official premises or from the performance of specified functions when such exclusion is determined in writing to be essential to the functioning of the post or office to which the Grievant is assigned.</P>

          <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall not determine that action to suspend without pay a Grievant shall be suspended if the head of an agency or his designee has determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that a Grievant has committed a job-related crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and has taken action to suspend the Grievant without pay pending a final resolution of the underlying matter. For this purpose, reasonable cause to believe that a member has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed shall be defined as a member of the Service having been convicted of, and sentence of imprisonment having been imposed for a job-related crime.<PRTPAGE P="267"/>

          <P>(b) Where a grievant establishes that an evaluation contained falsely prejudicial material which may have been a substantial factor in an agency action, and the question is presented whether the agency would have taken the same action had the evaluation not contained that material, the burden will shift to the agency to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have done so.</P>
          <P>(c) Where a grievant establishes that a procedural error occurred which is of such a nature that it may have been a substantial factor in an agency action with respect to the grievant, and the question is presented whether the agency would have taken the same action had the procedural error not occurred, the burden will shift to the agency to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have done so.</P>

          <P>In grievances over disciplinary actions, the agency has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the disciplinary action was justified, provided, however, that in a grievance concerning suspension without pay pursuant to section 610(a)(3) of the Act, the Board's determination of the grievance shall be limited to:</P>
          <P>(a) Whether the required procedures have been followed; and</P>

          <P>(b) The head of the Agency shall make a written decision on the recommendation of the Board within 30 days after receiving the recommendation and shall implement the recommendation of the Board except to the extent that the head of the Agency rejects the recommendation in whole or in part on the basis of a determination that implementation of the recommendation would be contrary to law or would adversely affect the foreign policy or national security of the United States. If the head of the Agency rejects the recommendation in whole or in part, the decision shall specify the reasons for such action. Copies of the decision shall be served on the other parties. Pending the decision of the head of the Agency, there shall be no ex parte communication concerning the grievance between the head of the Agency and any person involved in the proceedings of the Board.

          <P>(d)(1) If the head of the Agency makes a written decision under paragraph (b) of this section rejecting a recommendation in whole or in part on the basis of a determination that implementing such recommendation would be contrary to law, the head of the Agency shall, within the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (b) of this section:</P>

Reconsideration shall be limited to the question of whether implementing the Board's original recommendation, either in whole or in part, as applicable, would be contrary to law.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Access to records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided by law or regulation any individual upon request may gain access to his or her record or to any information pertaining to him or her which is contained in any system or records maintained by the Inter-American Foundation. The individual will be permitted, and upon his or her request, a person of his or her own choosing permitted to accompany him or her, to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him or her. The Inter-American foundation will require, however, a written statement from the individual authorizing discussion of that individual's record in the accompanying person's presence.</P>
          <P>(b) Any individual may request amendment of any Inter-American Foundation record pertaining to him or her. Not later than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of such request, the Inter-American Foundation will acknowledge in writing such receipt. The Inter-American Foundation will also promptly either:</P>
          <P>(1) Correct any part thereof which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete; or</P>
          <P>(2) Inform the individual of the Inter-American Foundation's refusal to amend the record in accordance with his or her request, the reason for the refusal, the procedures by which the individual may request a review of that refusal by the Administrator or designee, and the name and address of such official.</P>

          <P>(c) Any individual who disagrees with the Inter-American Foundation's refusal to amend his or her record may request a review of such refusal. The Inter-American Foundation will complete such review not later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date on which the individual requests <PRTPAGE P="282"/>such review and make a final determination unless, for good cause shown, the Administrator extends such 30-day period.

          <P>(d) In any disclosure, containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement, occurring after the filing of the statement under paragraph (c) of this section, the Inter-American Foundation will clearly note any part of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement (and, if the Inter-American Foundation deems it appropriate, copies also of a concise statement of the Inter-American Foundation's reasons for not making the amendments requested) to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record has been disclosed.</P>
          <P>(e) Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a, however, allows an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>

          <P>(b) If at any time an Inter-American Foundation system or systems of records is determined to be exempt from the application of 5 U.S.C. 552a in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k), the number of records contained in such system or systems will be separately listed and reported to the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the then prevailing guidelines and instructions of that agency.</P>

          <P>The following definitions apply:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency</E> includes any executive department, military department, government corporation, government controlled corporation other establishment in the executive branch of the government (including the Executive Office of the President) or any independent regulatory agency, and is headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members, a majority of whom are appointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and any subdivision thereof authorized to act on behalf of the agency. The Inter-American Foundation is a government corporation headed by a nine-member Board of Directors, all of whom are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is therefore an “agency” under these terms.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Meeting</E> means the deliberation of this Board of Directors where such deliberation determines or results in the joint conduct or disposition of official IAF business, but does not include deliberations required or permitted by subsection 1004.6 or 1004.7.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Requirement of open meetings.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The IAF shall open every portion of every meeting of the agency for public observation. Except in a case where the agency finds that the public interest requires otherwise, this requirement <PRTPAGE P="286"/>does not apply where the agency determines that such portion or portions of its meeting or the disclosure of such information is likely to:</P>
          <P>(a) Disclose matters that are:</P>
          <P>(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy, and</P>
          <P>(2) In fact, properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</P>
          <P>(b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practice of the agency;</P>
          <P>(c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:</P>
          <P>(1) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such manner as to have no discretion on the issue, or</P>
          <P>(2) Establishes practical criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
          <P>(d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
          <P>(e) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;</P>
          <P>(f) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
          <P>(g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:</P>
          <P>(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,</P>
          <P>(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial of an impartial adjudication,</P>
          <P>(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</P>
          <P>(4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source,</P>
          <P>(5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or</P>
          <P>(6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</P>
          <P>(h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;</P>
          <P>(i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action. This shall not apply in any instance where the IAF has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action or where the IAF is required by law to make such disclosure of its own initiative prior to taking final IAF action on such proposal;</P>

          <P>(j) Specifically concern the IAF's issuance of subpoena, or the IAF's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the IAF of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in section 554 of this title or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.

          <SUBJECT>Procedures for announcing meetings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In the case of each meeting, the IAF shall make public, at least one week before the meeting, of the time, place and subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and phone number of the official designated by the IAF to respond to requests for information about the meeting. Such announcement shall be made unless a majority of the Board of Directors of the IAF determines by a recorded vote that the IAF requires that such a meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case the IAF shall make public announcement of the time, place and subject matter of such meeting and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practical time.</P>

          <P>(b) Immediately following the public announcement, the IAF will submit notice for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            <PRTPAGE P="287"/>
          </P>
          <P>(c) The IAF shall also make public the announcement by other reasonable means, accessible to the public.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1004.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for closing meetings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The closing of a meeting or a portion of a meeting shall occur only when:</P>
          <P>(1) A majority of the membership of the IAF Board votes to take such action. That vote shall determine whether or not any portion or portions of a meeting or portions of a series of meetings may be closed to public observation for any of the reasons provided in § 1004.4 and whether or not the public interest nevertheless requires that portion of the meeting or meetings remain open. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Board member participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.</P>
          <P>(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the IAF close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in § 1004.4 the IAF, upon request of any one of its Board members, shall take a recorded vote, whether to close such portion of the meeting.</P>
          <P>(b) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to this Section, the IAF shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question and full written explanation of its action closing the entire or portion of the meeting together with a list of persons expecting to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</P>
          <P>(c) The IAF shall, subject to change, announce the time, place and subject matter of the meeting at least 7 days before the meeting.</P>
          <P>(d) For every closed meeting pursuant to § 1004.4, the General Counsel of the IAF shall publicly certify prior to a Board of Directors' vote on closing the meeting, that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the IAF.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1004.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Reconsideration of opening or closing of meeting.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The time or place of a Board meeting may be changed, without vote, following public announcement. The IAF will announce any such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the agency to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed only if a majority of the Board of Directors determines by a recorded vote that IAF business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and the IAF publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon such change at the earliest practicable time.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1004.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Transcripts, recording of closed meetings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The IAF shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, except that in the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (d), (h), or (j) of § 1004.4, the IAF shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes. Such records shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflecting the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such records.</P>

          <P>(b) The IAF, after review by the General Counsel shall make promptly <PRTPAGE P="288"/>available to the public, in a place easily accessible to the public, the transcript or electronic recording or minutes of the discussion of any time on the agenda, or any item of the testimony of any witness received at the Board meeting, except for such item or items of such discussion or testimony as the IAF determines to contain information which may be withheld under § 1004.4. Copies of such transcript, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription. The IAF shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion or any IAF proceedings with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1005.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

        <SECTION>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1005.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens <PRTPAGE P="292"/>but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1005.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1005.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1005.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>

          <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of <PRTPAGE P="294"/>the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Exclusion or excluded,</E> which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Disqualification or disqualified,</E> which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Ineligibility or ineligible,</E> which generally refers to a person who is either excluded or disqualified.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does this part do?</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension for Inter-American Foundation nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).</P>

            <P>The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:</P>
            <P>(a) A direct award to—</P>
            <P>(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;</P>
            <P>(2) A public international organization;</P>
            <P>(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or</P>
            <P>(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.</P>

            <P>(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.</P>
            <P>(c) Federal employment.</P>
            <P>(d) A transaction that the Inter-American Foundation needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.</P>
            <P>(e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the Inter-American Foundation specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.</P>
            <P>(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.</P>

            <P>(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but</P>
            <P>(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).</P>
            <P>(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:</P>
            <P>(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 1006.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.</P>
            <P>(2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) Inter-American Foundation official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.</P>
            <P>(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When may the suspending official issue a suspension?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that—</P>
            <P>(a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 1006.800(a), or</P>

            <P>(b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 1006.800(b) through (d); and<PRTPAGE P="307"/>

            <SUBJECT>What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.</P>
            <P>(b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.</P>
            <P>(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?</SUBJECT>
            <P>This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</P>
            <P>(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</P>
            <P>(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.</P>
            <P>(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.</P>
            <P>(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.</P>
            <P>(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.</P>
            <P>(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.</P>
            <P>(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.</P>
            <P>(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.</P>
            <P>(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.</P>
            <P>(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.</P>

            <P>(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the <PRTPAGE P="313"/>individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.</P>
            <P>(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.</P>
            <P>(s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How long may my debarment last?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 1006.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.</P>
            <P>(c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When do I know if the debarring official debars me?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.</P>
            <P>(b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 1006.615 that the official decided, either—</P>
            <P>(1) Not to debar you; or</P>
            <P>(2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:</P>
            <P>(i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;</P>
            <P>(ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;</P>
            <P>(iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective dates; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Advises you that your debarment is effective for covered transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee grants an exception.</P>

            <P>(a) Newly discovered material evidence;</P>
            <P>(b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;</P>

            <P>(b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.</P>

            <P>(1) To the Inter-American Foundation official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or<PRTPAGE P="324"/>
            </P>

          <SUBJECT>General policy: Collection and use of personal information.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Heads of Divisions, Branches, and the projects shall ensure that all Section personnel subject to their supervision are advised of the provisions of the Act, including the criminal penalties and civil liabilities provided therein, and that Section personnel are made aware of their responsibilities to protect the security of personal information, to assure its accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness, to avoid unauthorized disclosure either orally or in writing, and to ensure that no system of records concerning individuals, no matter how small or specialized, is maintained without public notice.</P>

          <P>(1) Areas in which the records are maintained or regularly used shall be posted with an appropriate warning stating that access to the records is limited to authorized persons.

For purposes of this paragraph, a master key is a key which may be used to open rooms other than the room containing records subject to the Act, unless those rooms are utilized by officials or employees authorized to have access to the records subject to the Act.</P>

          <P>(5) Personnel handling personal information during routine use will ensure that the information is properly controlled to prevent unintentional or unauthorized disclosure. Such information will be used, held, or stored only <PRTPAGE P="332"/>where facilities or conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized or unintentional disclosure.</P>
          <P>(c) When the records subject to the Act are maintained in computerized form, safeguards shall be utilized based on those recommended in the National Bureau of Standard's booklet “Computer Security Guidelines for Implementing the Privacy Act of 1974” (May 30, 1975), and any supplements thereto, which are adequate and appropriate to assuring the integrity of the records.</P>

          <P>(iii) A document bearing either the photograph or the signature of the individual, preferably issued for participation in a federally sponsored program (for example, Medicaid card). In the event the individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, the Section will require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3).</P>

          <P>(2) Not in person: If the individual making a request does not appear in person before the PA Officer, a certificate of a notary public or equivalent <PRTPAGE P="333"/>officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request.</P>
          <P>(3) Parents of minors and legal guardians: An individual acting as the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual or an heir or legal representative of a deceased person to whom a record pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the manner prescribed in either paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section. In addition, such individual shall establish his or her identity in the representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of a legal guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the court's order. A parent or legal guardian may act only for a living individual, not for a decedent. A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal access to a record by another individual, provided the requirements of paragraph (f) of § 1101.7 are satisfied. In the case of an heir or legal representative of a deceased person the proof of identity shall be a certified copy of the Will, if any; the order of a court of competent jurisdiction admitting the Will to probate; the order of a court of competent jurisdiction appointing an executor, executrix, or administrator; a letter of administration; or any other documentary evidence which establishes the identity of the individual as an heir or legal representative of a deceased person.</P>
          <P>(g) When the provisions of this part are alleged to have the effect of impeding an individual in exercising his or her right to access, the Section will consider, from an individual making a request, alternative suggestions regarding proof of identity and access to records.</P>
          <P>(h) An inquiry which is not addressed as specified in paragraph (b) of this section or which is not marked as specified in paragraph (c) of this section will be so addressed and marked by the Section's personnel and forwarded immediately to the PA Officer. An inquiry which is not properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been “received” for purposes of measuring time periods for response until forwarding of the inquiry to the PA Officer has been effected. In each instance when an inquiry so forwarded is received, the PA Officer shall notify the individual that his or her inquiry was improperly addressed and the date when the inquiry was received at the proper address.</P>
          <P>(i) Each inquiry received shall be acted upon promptly by the PA Officer. Although there is no fixed time when an agency must respond to a request for access to records under the Act, every effort will be made to respond within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the date of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten (10) days, the PA Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that period providing information on the status of the inquiry and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the inquiry. Every effort will be made to provide the requested records within thirty (30) days.</P>
          <P>(j) An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her inquiry.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Disclosure of records to individuals who are subjects of those records.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Each request received shall be acted upon promptly by the PA Officer. Every effort will be made to respond within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the date of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten (10) days due to unusual circumstances, the PA Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that period providing information on the status of the request and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the request. Every effort will be made to provide the requested records within thirty (30) days. “Unusual circumstances” shall include circumstances where a search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage, field facilities or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved, instances where information on other individuals must be separated <PRTPAGE P="334"/>or expunged from the particular record, and cases where consultations with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request are necessary.</P>
          <P>(b) Grant of access:</P>
          <P>(1) Notification.</P>
          <P>(i) An individual shall be granted access to a record pertaining to him or her except where the record is subject to an exemption under the Act and these rules.</P>
          <P>(ii) The PA Officer shall notify the individual of such determination and provide the following information:</P>
          <P>(A) The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
          <P>(B) The place at which the records may be inspected;</P>
          <P>(C) The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the period of time that the records will remain available for inspection. In no event shall the earliest date be later than thirty (30) days from the date of notification;</P>
          <P>(D) The estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed and the estimate of fees pursuant to § 1101.11. In no event shall be estimated date be later than thirty (30) days from the date of notification;</P>
          <P>(E) The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be accompanied by another individual during the personal access, subject to the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(F) Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a specific record.</P>
          <P>(2) Method of access: The following methods of access to records by an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given situation:</P>
          <P>(i) Inspection in person may be made in the office specified by the PA Officer, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding holidays);</P>
          <P>(ii) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to the individual may be arranged, but only if the PA Officer determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can be properly supervised at that facility, and that transmittal of the records to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of the section or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both money and manpower; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Copies may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject to payment of the fees prescribed in § 1101.11. The Section, at its own initiative, may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no fee will be charged to the individual.</P>
          <P>(c) Access to medical records: Upon advice by a physician that release of medical information directly to the requester could have an adverse effect on the requester, the Section may attempt to arrange an acceptable alternative. This will normally involve release of such information to a physician named by the requester, with the requester's written consent. (Note that release to any third party, including a physician or family member, must comply with the provisions of § 1101.8 of this part.)</P>
          <P>(d) The Section shall supply such other information and assistance at the time of access to make the record intelligible to the individual.</P>
          <P>(e) The Section reserves the right to limit access to copies and abstracts of original records, rather than the original records. This election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an automated data media such as tape of disc, when the record contains information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is permissible under exemptions (for example 5, U.S.C. 552(k)(1)). In no event shall original records of the Section be made available to the individual except under the immediate supervision of the PA Officer or his designee. Title 18 U.S.C. 2701(a) makes it a crime to conceal, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy a record filed in a public office, or to attempt to do any of the foregoing.</P>

          <P>(f) Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her choice. “Accompanied” includes discussion of the record in the presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record pertains shall authorize the presence of the other individual in writing and shall include the name of the other individual, a specific description of the record to which access is <PRTPAGE P="335"/>sought, and the date and the signature of the individual to whom the record pertains. The other individual shall sign the authorization in the presence of the PA Officer or his designee. An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision to be accompanied by another individual during the personal access to a record.</P>
          <P>(g) Initial denial of access:</P>
          <P>(1) Grounds. Access by an individual to a record which pertains to that individual will be denied only upon a determination by the PA Officer that:</P>
          <P>(i) The record is subject to an exemption under the Act and these rules;</P>
          <P>(ii) The record is information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding;</P>
          <P>(iii) The provisions of § 1101.7(c) pertaining to medical records have been temporarily invoked; or</P>
          <P>(iv) The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the procedural requirements of these rules.</P>
          <P>(2) Notification. The PA Officer shall give notice of denial of access of records to the individual in writing and shall include the following information:</P>
          <P>(i) The PA Officer's name and title or position;</P>
          <P>(ii) The date of denial;</P>
          <P>(iii) The reasons for the denial, including citation to the appropriate section of the Act and these rules;</P>
          <P>(iv) The individual's opportunities for further administrative consideration, including the identity and address of the responsible official;</P>
          <P>(v) If stated to be administratively final within the Section, the individual's right to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) (1) and (5).</P>
          <P>(3) Administrative review: When an initial denial of a request is issued by the PA Officer, the individual's opportunities for further consideration shall be as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) As to denial under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the sole procedure is a petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule under 5 U.S.C. 553(e). Such petition shall be filed with the Commissioner, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. If the exception was determined by another agency, the PA Officer will provide the individual with the name and address of the other agency and any relief sought by the individual shall be that provided by the regulations of the other agency. Within the Section, no such denial is administratively final until such a petition has been filed by the individual and disposed of on the merits by the Commissioner.</P>
          <P>(ii) As to denial under paragraphs (g)(1), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section, the individual may file for review with the Commissioner, as indicated in the PA Officer's initital denial notification.</P>
          <P>(h) If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the PA Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.</P>

          </P>
          <P>(v) To a recipient who has provided the agency with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;</P>
          <P>(vi) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or his designee to determine whether the record has such value;</P>
          <P>(vii) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the agency which maintains the record specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;</P>
          <P>(viii) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if upon such disclosure notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;</P>
          <P>(ix) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee, and to a Congressman who is acting on behalf of his constituent;</P>
          <P>(x) To the Comptroller General, or any of his authorized representatives, in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting Office; or</P>
          <P>(xi) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction;</P>
          <P>(5) When required by the Act and not covered explicitly by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(b). These situations include the following:</P>

          <P>(a) Each system manager shall establish a system of accounting for all disclosures of records, either orally or in writing made outside the Section, unless otherwise exempted under this section. Accounting procedures may be established in the least expensive and most convenient form that will permit the PA Officer to advise individuals promptly upon request of the persons or agencies to which records concerning them have been disclosed. Accounting of disclosures made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7) relating to civil or criminal law enforcement activities shall not be made available to the individual named in the record.</P>

          <P>(b) Accounting records, at a minimum, shall include the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a <PRTPAGE P="337"/>record and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure was made.

The estimate of time may take into account unusual circumstances as described in § 1101.7(a). No acknowledgment will be sent if the request can be reviewed, processed and the individual notified of the results of review (either compliance or denial) within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays). Requests filed in person will be acknowledged in writing at the time submitted.</P>
          <P>(2) Promptly after acknowledging receipt of a request, or after receiving such further information as might have been requested, or after arriving at a decision within ten (10) days, the PA Officer shall either:</P>
          <P>(i) Make the requested correction or amendment and advise the individual in writing of such action, providing either a copy of the corrected or amended record or a statement as to the means whereby the correction or amendment was effected in cases where a copy cannot be provided (for example, erasure of information from a record maintained only in an electronic data bank); or</P>
          <P>(ii) Inform the individual in writing that his or her request is denied and provide the following information:</P>

          <FP>The term promptly in this paragraph means within thirty (30) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays). If the PA Officer cannot make the determination within thirty (30) days, the individual will be advised in writing of the reason therefor and of the estimated date by which the determination will be made.</FP>
          <P>(b) Whenever an individual's record is corrected or amended pursuant to a request by that individual, the PA Officer shall notify all persons and agencies to which copies of the record had been disclosed prior to its correction or amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure required by the Act was made. The notification shall require a receipt agency maintaining the record to acknowledge receipt of the notification, to correct or amend the record, and to apprise any agency or person to which it has disclosed the record of the substance of the correction or amendment.</P>
          <P>(c) The following criteria will be considered by the PA Officer in reviewing a request for correction or amendment.</P>
          <P>(1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;</P>
          <P>(2) The factual accuracy of the information;</P>

          <P>(4) The timeliness and currency of the information in light of the purpose for which it was collected;</P>
          <P>(5) The completeness of the information in terms of the purpose for which it was collected;</P>
          <P>(6) The degree of possibility that denial of the request could unfairly result in determinations adverse to the individual;</P>
          <P>(7) The character of the record sought to be corrected or amended; and</P>
          <P>(8) The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific means of correction or amendment requested by the individual.</P>
          <P>(d) The Section will not undertake to gather evidence for the individual, but does reserve the right to verify the evidence which the individual submits.</P>
          <P>(e) Correction or amendment of a record requested by an individual will be denied only upon a determination by the PA Officer that:</P>
          <P>(1) The individual has failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the propriety of the correction or amendment in light of the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
          <P>(2) The record sought to be corrected or amended was compiled in a terminated judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to which the individual was a party or participant;</P>

          <P>(3) The record sought to be corrected or amended is the subject of a pending <PRTPAGE P="339"/>judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to which the individual is a party or participant;</P>
          <P>(4) The correction or amendment would violate a duly enacted statute or promulgated regulation; or</P>
          <P>(5) The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the procedural requirements of these rules.</P>

          <P>(b) The time for decision on the appeal begins on the date the appeal is received by the Commissioner. The appeal should include any documentation, information or statements advanced for the amendment of the record.</P>
          <P>(c) There shall be a written record of the reason for the final determination. The final determination will be made not later than thirty (30) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) from the date the Commissioner receives the appeal; unless, for good cause shown, the Commissioner extends such determination beyond the thirty (30) day period.</P>
          <P>(d) When the final determination is that the record should be amended in accordance with the individual's request, the Commissioner shall direct the office responsible for the record to comply. The office responsible for the record shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Amend the record as directed;</P>
          <P>(2) If a distribution of the record has been made, advise all previous recipients of the record of the amendment and its substance;</P>
          <P>(3) So advise the individual in writing.</P>
          <P>(e) When the final decision is that the request of the individual to amend the record is refused, the Commissioner shall advise the individual:</P>
          <P>(1) Of the refusal and the reasons for it;</P>
          <P>(2) Of his or her right to file a concise statement of the reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the Section;</P>
          <P>(3) Of the procedures for filing the statement of disagreement;</P>
          <P>(4) That the statement which is filed will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with, at the discretion of the Section, a brief statement by the Section summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the record;</P>
          <P>(5) That prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of any statement of dispute to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was maintained; and</P>
          <P>(6) Of his or her right to seek judicial review of the Section's refusal to amend the record.</P>

          <P>(f) When the final determination is to refuse to amend a record and the individual has filed a statement under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the Section will clearly annotate the record so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent to anyone who may subsequently have access to use or disclose it. When information that is the subject of a statement of dispute <PRTPAGE P="340"/>filed by an individual is subsequently disclosed, the Section will note that the information is disputed and provide a copy of the individual's statement. The Section may also include a brief summary of the reasons for not making a correction when disclosing disputed information. Such statements will normally be limited to the reasons given to the individual for not amending the record. Copies of the Section's statement shall be treated as part of the individual's record for granting access; however, it will not be subject to amendment by the individual under these rules.</P>
          <P>(g) An appeal will be decided on the basis of the individual's appeal papers and the record submitted by the PA officer. No personal appearance or hearings on appeals will be allowed.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purpose of this part is to prescribe rules, guidelines and procedures to implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended on November 21, 1974, by Public Law 93-502, and on October 27, 1986, by Public Law 99-570.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Act</E> means the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Commercial-use request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a cause or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Section will consider how the requester will use the documents.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Commissioner</E> means head of the United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which the Section actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility where the records are stored.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Disclose or disclosure</E> means making records available, on request for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document in response to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable documentation. The Section will provide a copy of the material in a form that is usable by the requester unless it is administratively burdensome to do so.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is referenced above, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Person</E> or <E T="03">Requester</E> includes any individual, firm, corporation, organization or other entity.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Records</E> and/or <E T="03">information</E> are defined as all books, papers, manuals, maps, photographs, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by the Section under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business or in carrying out its treaty responsibilities and obligations, and preserved or appropriate for preservation by the Section as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the information value of the data in them, but does not include books, magazines or other material acquired solely for library purposes and through other sources, and does not include analyses, computations, or compilations of information not extant at the time of the request. The term “records” does not include objects or articles such as structures, furniture, paintings, sculptures, three-dimensional models, vehicles, and equipment.<PRTPAGE P="342"/>
          </P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. In the case of “freelance” journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization even though not actually employed by it.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Request</E> means a letter or other written communication seeking records or information under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for commercial use to determine if any portion of that document is permitted to be withheld, and processing any document for disclosure (i.e., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release). It does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searches should be performed in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the Section and the requester; for example, line-by-line searches should not be undertaken when it would be more efficient to duplicate the entire document. Note that such activity should be distinguished from “review” of material in determining whether the material is exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</P>
          <P>The <E T="03">Section</E> means United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico.
          </P>
          <FP>All terms used in this part which are defined in 5 U.S.C. 552 shall have the same meaning herein.</FP>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1102.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for requesting access to records or information.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A request for any information or records shall be addressed to the FOIA Officer, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. The envelope and the letter shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Request” or “Request for Records,” or the equivalent, to distinguish it from other mail to the Section. If the request is not so marked and addressed, the 10-day time limit described in the Act will not begin to run until the request has been received by the FOIA Officer in the normal course of business. In each instance where a request is received in the normal course of business, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester that its request was improperly addressed and the date the request was received.</P>
          <P>(b) In order for the Section to locate records or information and make them available, it is necessary that it be able to identify the specific record or information sought. Persons wishing to inspect or obtain copies of records or information should, therefore, seek to identify them as fully and accurately as possible. In cases where requests are submitted which are not sufficient to permit identification, the FOIA Officer will endeavor to assist the persons seeking the records or information in filling in necessary details. In most cases, however, persons seeking records or information will find that time taken in trying to identify materials in the beginning is well worth their while in enabling the Section to respond promptly to their request.</P>
          <P>(c) A person submitting a request should—</P>
          <P>(1) Indicate the specific event or action, if any or if known, to which the request has reference.</P>

          <P>(2) Designate the Division, Branch, or Project Office of the Section which may be responsible for or may have <PRTPAGE P="343"/>produced the record or information requested.</P>
          <P>(3) Furnish the date of the record or information or the date or period to which it refers or relates, if known.</P>
          <P>(4) Name the character of record or information, such as a contract, an application, or a report.</P>
          <P>(5) List the Section's personnel who may have prepared or have knowledge of the record or information.</P>
          <P>(6) Furnish the reference material such as newspapers or publications which are known to have made a reference to the record or information desired.</P>
          <P>(7) If the request relates to a matter in pending litigation or one which has been litigated, supply the Court location and case style and number.</P>
          <P>(8) Describe, when the request includes more than one record or source of information, specifically each record or information so that availability may be separately determined.</P>
          <P>(9) Clearly indicate whether the request is an initial request or an appeal from a denial of a record or information previously requested.</P>
          <P>(10) Identify, when the request concerns a matter about the Section's personnel, the person as follows: First name, middle name or initial, and surname; date and place of birth; and social security account number, if known.</P>
          <P>(d) No particular format is needed for the request, except that it:</P>
          <P>(1) Must be in writing;</P>
          <P>(2) Must describe the records or information sought with sufficient detail to permit identification;</P>
          <P>(3) Should state a limitation of the fees the requester is willing to pay, if any; and</P>
          <P>(4) Must include the name, address, and telephone number (optional) of the person submitting the request.</P>

          </LDRWK>
          
          <P>(ix) <E T="03">Postage and handling.</E> It will be up to the person requesting the records or information to designate how the material will be mailed or shipped. In the absence of such instructions no records or information will be sent to a foreign address, and records and information will be sent to domestic addresses utilizing first class certified mail, return receipt requested and will be billed at direct cost to the Section.</P>

          <P>(2) Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use will be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether thay are exempt from mandatory disclosure. The cost for review will be calculated based on the salary of the category of the employee who actually performed the review plus 16% of the rate to cover <PRTPAGE P="344"/>benefits. Charges will be assessed only for the initial review (i.e., review undertaken the first time in order to analyze the applicability of specific exemption(s) to a particular record or portion of record) and not review at the administrative appeal level of the exemption(s) already applied.</P>
          <P>(3) If records requested under this part are stored elsewhere than the headquarters of the U.S. Section, IBWC, 4171 North Mesa, EL Paso, TX, the special cost of returning such records to the headquarters shall be include in the search costs. These costs will be computed at the actual costs of transportation of either a person or the requested record between the place where the record is stored and the Section headquarters when, for time or other reasons, it is not feasible to rely on Government mail service.</P>
          <P>(4) When no specific fee has been established for a service, or the request for a service does not fall under one of the above categories due to the amount or size or type thereof, the FOIA Officer is authorized to establish an appropriate fee, pursuant to the criteria established in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-25, entitled “User Charges.”</P>
          <P>(b) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this part will amount to more than $25 and the requester has not indicated in advance her/his willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated, the requester shall be promptly notified of the amount of the anticipated fees or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. The notice or request for an advance deposit shall extend an offer to the requester to confer with knowledgeable Section personnel in an attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the fees and meet the needs of the requester. Dispatch of such notice or request shall suspend the running of the period for response by the Section until a reply is received from the requester.</P>
          <P>(c) Search costs are due and payable even if the record which was requested cannot be located after all reasonable efforts have been made, or if the Section determines that a record which has been requested, but which is exempt from disclosure under this part, is to be withheld.</P>
          <P>(d) The Section will begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The accrual of interest will be stayed upon receipt of the fee, rather than upon its processing by the Section. Interest will at the rate precribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C.</P>
          <P>(e) A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Section reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Section will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
          <P>(f) The Section will not require a requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, unless:</P>
          <P>(1) The Section estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then the Section will notify the requester of the likely costs and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or</P>

          <P>(2) Requesters who have previously failed to pay fees charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), the Section will require such requesters to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above or demonstrate that they have, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process new requests or pending requests from such requesters.
          </P>

          <FP>When the Section acts under paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section, the administrative time limit prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests plus permissible extensions of <PRTPAGE P="345"/>that time limit) will begin only after the Section has received payments described above.</FP>
          <P>(g) In accordance with the provisions and authorities of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), the Section reserves the right to disclose information to consumer reporting agencies and to use collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1102.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Categories of requesters for fee purposes.</SUBJECT>
          <P>There are four categories of requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories. The Section will take into account information provided by requesters in determining their eligibility for inclusion in one of these categories is as defined in § 1102.2. It is in the requester's best interest to provide as much information as possible to demonstrate inclusion within a non-commercial category of fee treatment.</P>
          <P>(a) The Section will assess charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought for commercial use. Commercial use requesters are entitled to neither two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents.</P>
          <P>(b) The Section will provide documents to educational and non-commercial scientific institutions for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by, and under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
          <P>(c) The Section will provide documents to representatives of the news media for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category; a requester must meet the criteria in § 1102.2(m), and the request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requesters, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.</P>
          <P>(d) The Section will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Moreover, requests from record subjects for records about themselves will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction.</P>
          <P>(e) In making determinations under this section, the Section may take into account whether requesters who previously were granted (b), (c), or (d) status under the Act did in fact use the requested records for purposes compatible with the status accorded them.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1102.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fee waivers and appeals.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Waiver or reduction of any fee provided for in § 1102.4 may be made upon a determination by the FOIA Officer, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. The Section shall furnish documents without charge or at a reduced charge provided that: Disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for a waiver or <PRTPAGE P="346"/>reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.</P>
          <P>(1) In order to determine whether disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, the Section will consider the following four factors:</P>
          <P>(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Government;</P>
          <P>(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of Government operations or activities;</P>
          <P>(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of Government operations or activities.</P>
          <P>(2) In order to determine whether disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Section will consider the following two factors:</P>
          <P>(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</P>
          <P>(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
          <P>(b) The Section will not consider waiver or reduction of fees for requesters (persons or organizations) from whom unpaid fees remain due to the Section for another information access request.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) The Section's decision to refuse to waive or reduce fees as requested under paragraph (a) of this section may be appealed to the Commissioner, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Suite C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422. Appeals should contain as much information and documentation as possible to support the request for a waiver or reduction of fees.</P>
          <P>(2) Appeals will be reviewed by the Commissioner, who may consult with other officials of the Section as appropriate. The requester will be notified within thirty working days from the date on which the Section received the appeal.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1102.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>The Section's determination and appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Upon receipt of any request for records of information under the Act the following guidelines shall be followed:</P>
          <P>(a) The FOIA Officer will determine within 10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and will immediately notify the person making such request of such determination, the reasons therefore, and of the right to such person to appeal to the Commissioner any adverse determination.</P>

          <P>(b) All appeals should be addressed to the Commissioner, United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Suite, C-310, El Paso, TX 79902-1422, and should be clearly identified as such on the envelope and in the letter of appeal by using the marking “Freedom of Information Appeal” or “Appeal for Records” or the equivalent. Failure to properly address an appeal may defer the date of receipt by the Section to take into account the time reasonably required to forward the appeal to the Commissioner. In each instance when an appeal is incorrectly addressed to the Commissioner, he shall notify the person making the appeal that his appeal was improperly addressed and of the date the appeal was received by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will make a determination with respect to any appeal within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the receipt of an appeal. If on appeal the denial or the request is in whole or in part upheld, the Commissioner will notify the person making such request of the provisions for <PRTPAGE P="347"/>judicial review under the Act. An appeal must be in writing and filed within 30 days from receipt of the initial determination (in cases of denials of an entire request), or from receipt of any records being made available pursuant to the initial determination (in case of partial denials). In those cases where a request or appeal is not addressed to the proper official, the time limitations stated above will be computed from the receipt of the request or appeal by the proper official.</P>
          <P>(c) In unusual circumstances, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, the time limits for responding to the original request or the appeal may be extended by not more than an additional 10 working days by written notice to the person making a request. This notice must be sent within either 10- or 20-day time limit and will specify the reason for the extension and the date on which determination is expected to be dispatched. The extension may be invoked only once during the consideration of a request either during the initial consideration period or during the consideration of an appeal, but not both.</P>
          <P>(d) The unusual circumstances are:</P>
          <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request.</P>
          <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
          <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the requestor among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</P>
          <P>(e) If the FOIA Officer receives a request which is of proper concern to an agency or entity outside the Section, it will be returned to the person making the request, advising the requester to refer it to the appropriate agency or entity if requester desires, and providing the requester with the name or title, address and other appropriate information. An information copy of the request and the letter of referral will be forwarded promptly to the agency or entity outside the Section that may expect the request. In the event the FOIA Officer receives a request to make available a record or provide information which is of interest to more than one agency (Federal, State, municipal, or legal entity created thereby), the FOIA Officer will retain and act upon the request if the Section is one of the interest agencies and if its interest in the record is paramount.</P>
          <P>(f) The Commissioner's determination on an appeal shall be in writing and when it denies records in whole or in part, the letter to the person making a request shall include:</P>
          <P>(1) Notation of the specific exemption or exemptions of the Act authorizing the withholding.</P>
          <P>(2) A statement that the decision is final for the Section.</P>
          <P>(3) Advice that judicial review of the denial is available in the district in which the person making the request resides or has his principal place of business, the district in which the Section's records are situated, or the District of Columbia.</P>

          <P>(4) The names and titles or positions of each official responsible for the denial of a request.
          </P>
          <FP>When appropriate, the written determination may also state how an exemption applied in that particular case, and, when relevant, why a discretionary rebase is not appropriate.</FP>
          <P>(g) In those cases where it is necessary to find and examine records before the legality or appropriateness of their disclosure can be determined, and where after diligent effort this has not been achieved within the required period, the FOIA Officer may advise the person making the request that a determination to presently deny the request has been made because the records or information have not been found or examined, that the determination will be considered when the search or examination is completed and the time within which completion is expected, but that the person making the request may immediately file an administrative appeal to the Commissioner.</P>

          <P>(b) The Section will provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record to a requester after deletion of the portions that are exempt under this section.</P>
          <P>(c) The section will invoke no exemption under this section if the requested records are available to the requester under the Privacy Act of 1974 and its implementing regulations.</P>
          <P>(d) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and</P>
          <P>(1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law, and</P>
          <P>(2) There is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this section.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>
          <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1103.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section <PRTPAGE P="353"/>through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1103.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands, and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the Commissioner for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Commissioner may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 1104.7(a) of this part.</P>
          <P>(b) Exceptions:</P>
          <P>(1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Commissioner's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.</P>
          <P>(2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaeological resource.</P>

          <P>(c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Commissioner's direction, associated with the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application procedures of § 1104.5. However, the Commissioner shall insure that provisions of §§ 1104.7 and 1104.8 have been met by other documented means, and that any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, as determined by the Commissioner, have been the subject of consideration under § 1104.6.</P>
          <P>(d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf of the State or its educational institutions, the Commissioner shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of §§ 1104.4(b)(5), 1104.6, 1104.7(a) (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 1104.8, 1104.9, 1104.11, and 1104.12(a) to such Governor or to such designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution approved by the Commissioner.</P>

          <P>(e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities governing the use of public lands, authorizations may be required for activities which do not require a permit under this part.

            <P>The maintenance of the highest standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and conduct by Government employees and special Government employees is essential to assure the proper performance of the Government business and the maintenance of confidence by citizens in their Government. The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest on the part of Government employees and special Government employees through informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these standards. To accord with these concepts the regulations in this part prescribe standards of conduct and responsibilities for employees and special Government employees and require statements reporting employment and financial interests.

            <P>(a) Counseling services on employee responsibilities and conduct are available in each agency. These services are to be coordinated by a Counselor appointed by the agency head. The Counselor for IDCA is the General Counsel. The Counselor serves as the agency's designee to the Civil Service Commission on matters covered by the regulations in this part and is responsible for coordination of the agency's counseling services under paragraph (b) of this section and for assuring that counseling and interpretations on questions of conflicts of interest and other matters covered by these sections are available to deputy counselors designated under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) Each agency head may designate deputy counselors for the agency's employees and special Government employees.

A Washington employee or special Government employee should address any inquiries concerning the regulations in this part to the Counselor. At missions abroad the chief of each agency's establishment designates an officer, preferably the legal officer where one is available, to provide counseling services under the guidance of the Counselor; a single officer may serve all agencies. An employee or special Government employee serving abroad should submit inquiries to the officer designated.</P>

            <P>(c) Each agency shall periodically notify its employees and special Government employees of the availability of counseling services and how and when <PRTPAGE P="369"/>these services are available. A new employee or special Government employee shall be notified at the time of entrance on duty.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acceptance prohibited.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, an employee shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who:</P>
            <P>(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with the employee's agency;</P>
            <P>(2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the employee's agency;</P>
            <P>(3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duty; or</P>
            <P>(4) Appears to be offering the gift with the hope or expectation of obtaining advantage or preferment in dealing with the U.S. Government for any purpose.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptance permitted.</E> The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to:</P>
            <P>(1) Gifts, gratuities, favors, entertainments, loans, or any other thing of monetary value received on account of close family or personal relationships when the circumstances make it clear that it is that relationship rather than the business of the persons concerned which is the motivating factor;</P>
            <P>(2) Acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans;</P>
            <P>(3) Acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, and other items of nominal intrinsic value;</P>
            <P>(4) Acceptance of rates and discounts offered to employees as a class.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Acceptance permitted for IDCA employees.</E> For IDCA employees the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to: Acceptance of food and <PRTPAGE P="370"/>refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or other meeting or on an inspection tour where an employee may properly be in attendance.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Acceptance permitted for AID employees.</E> For AID employees the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply in the following situations:</P>
            <P>(1) Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment of nominal value on infrequent occasions offered in the ordinary course of luncheons, dinners, or other meetings and gatherings hosted by foreign governments or agencies and officials thereof, embassies, and international organizations, where the primary purpose of the function is representational or social, rather than the transaction of business. Where the primary purpose of the function is the transaction of business, acceptance is not permitted, except if there is justification and reporting in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Participation in widely attended lunches, dinners, and similar gatherings sponsored by industrial, technical, and professional associations for the discussion of matters of mutual interest to Government and industry.</P>
            <P>(3) Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment in the unusual situation where the employee, by virtue of the location of the person, firm, corporation, or other entity, or the regulations governing its dining facilities, finds it inconvenient or impracticable not to accept the offer. Each case of acceptance shall be reported in accordance with the requirement of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. In no other case shall employees accept food, refreshments, or entertainment from private corporations, entities, firms, or individual contractors at occasions which are other than widely attended functions whose purposes are unrelated to Agency business.</P>

            <P>(4) In exceptional circumstances where acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment is not authorized by paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, but where, in the judgment of the individual concerned, the Government's interest would be served by such acceptance directly or indirectly from any foreign government, agency, or official thereof or a private person, firm, corporation, or other entity which is engaged or is endeavoring to engage in business transactions of any sort with AID, an employee may accept the offer: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That a report of the circumstances, together with the employee's statement as to how the Government's interests were served, will be made within 48 hours to the employee's supervisor, or, if the employee is serving abroad, or on temporary duty abroad, to the Mission Director.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Gifts to superiors.</E> An employee shall for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than the employee (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, or retirement.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Neither this section nor § 1203.735-204</E> precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this part for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on the employee's behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.</P>

            <P>(a) An employee shall not engage in outside employment or other outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge of the duties and responsibilities of Government employment. Incompatible activities include but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance may result in, or create the appearance of, conflicts of interest; or</P>

In addition, an employee who is a Presidential appointee covered by section 401(a) of the Executive order shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of the employee's agency, or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part of the body of public information.

            <P>(2) Engage in, directly or indirectly, a financial transaction as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through Government employment.</P>
            <P>(b) This section does not preclude an employee from having a financial interest or engaging in financial transactions to the same extent as a private citizen not employed by the Government so long as it is not prohibited by law or the regulations in this part.</P>

            <P>(c) Pursuant to the provision of 18 U.S.C. 208(b) the following described financial interests of an employee are <PRTPAGE P="372"/>hereby exempted from the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and 208(b)(1) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of an employee. The exemption applies to the financial interests held directly by an employee, by the employee's spouse or minor child whether individually or jointly with the employee, or by an employee and any partner or partners as joint assets of the partnership:</P>
            <P>(1) Investments in State and local government bonds; and stocks, bonds, or policies in a mutual fund, investment company, bank or insurance company, provided that in the case of a mutual fund, investment company, or bank, the fair value of such stock or bond holding does not exceed one percent of the value of the reported assets of the mutual fund, investment company, or bank. In the case of a mutual fund or investment company, this exemption applies only where the assets of the fund or company are diversified; it does not apply where the fund or company specializes in a particular industry or commodity.</P>

            <P>(2) Interest in an investment club or other group organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the fair value of the interest involved does not exceed $10,000 and that the interest does not exceed one-fourth of the total assets of the investment club or group. Where an employee covered by this exemption is a member of a group organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities, the interest of the employee in any enterprise in which the group holds securities shall be based upon the employee's equity share of the holdings of the group in that enterprise.</P>
            <P>(3) If an employee, or the employee's spouse or minor child has a present beneficial interest or a vested remainder interest under a trust, the ownership of stocks, bonds, or other corporate securities under the trust will be exempt to the same extent as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for the direct ownership of such securities. The ownership of bonds other than corporate bonds, or of shares in a mutual fund or regulated investment company, under the trust will be equally exempt and to the same extent as under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>

            <P>(4) If an employee is an officer, director, trustee, or employee of an educational institution, or if the employee is negotiating for, or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment with such an institution, a direct financial interest which the institution has in any matter will not itself be exempt, but any financial interest that the institution may have in the matter through its holdings of securities issued by business entities will be exempt: <E T="03">Provided,</E> The employee is not serving as a member of the investment committee of the institution or is not otherwise advising it on its investment portfolio.</P>
            <P>(5) An employee may continue to participate in a bona fide pension, retirement, group life, health or accident insurance plan, or other employee welfare or benefit plan that is maintained by a business or nonprofit organization by which the employee was formerly employed. Such financial interest in that organization will be exempt, except to the extent that the welfare or benefit plan is a profit-sharing or stock-bonus plan and the employee's financial interest thereunder exceeds $10,000. This exemption extends also to any financial interests that the organization may have in other business activities.</P>

            <P>(d) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to prohibit an employee from acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for the employee's parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or for any estate for which, the employee is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary, except in those matters in which the employee has participated personally and substantially as a Government employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which are the subject of the employee's official responsibility, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(b): <E T="03">Provided,</E> The head of the employee's division approves in writing.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Participation in activities of private organizations.</E> In participating in the program and activities of any private organization, an employee shall make clear that the employee's agency has no official connection with such organization and does not necessarily sponsor or sanction the viewpoints which it may express.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Legal restrictions on membership in certain organizations.</E> An employee shall not have membership in any organization that advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of Government in the United States, knowing that such organization so advocates (5 U.S.C. 7311, 18 U.S.C. 1918).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Private organizations concerned with foreign policy or other matters of concern to agencies.</E> (1) Limitation on participation. When a private organization is concerned primarily with foreign policy or international relations or other matters of concern to an employee's agency, an employee shall limit connection therewith as follows: Unless specifically permitted to do so, the employee may not serve as advisor, officer, director, teacher, sponsor, committee chairman, or in any other official capacity or permit the employee's name to be used on a letterhead, in a publication, in an announcement or news story, or at a public meeting, regardless of whether the employee's official title or connection is mentioned. The provisions of this section are not intended to prohibit the normal and active participation of an employee in professional organizations such as the American Political Science Association, the American Economic Association, the American Foreign Service Association, and similar organizations, since such participation is in the interest of both the employee and the Government. Employees are expected, however, to exercise discretion in such activities and are held personally accountable for any improper use of their relationship with IDCA.</P>
            <P>(2) Request for special permission. Special permission to assume or continue a connection prohibited by paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be granted in cases where the public interest will not be adversely affected. To request such permission, or to determine whether the provisions are applicable to a particular case, the employee shall address a memorandum setting forth all of the circumstances to the appropriate officer. The appropriate officer for IDCA is the Assistant Director for Administration.</P>
            <P>(3) Application to senior officers. Because of the prominence resulting from their official positions, chiefs of mission and other senior officers should recognize the particular bearing of the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon their activities. They should restrict association with any organizations involving foreign nations and the United States to simple membership and should not accept even honorary office in such organizations except with the specific prior approval as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Private organizations not concerned with foreign policy.</E> When the purpose and program of the organization do not fall primarily within the field of foreign policy or international relations, the employee's activity is limited only to the following extent:</P>
            <P>(1) The employee's official title or connection may be used to identify the employee, as in a civic association election, but may not be used on a letterhead, in a publication, or otherwise so as to employ the prestige of the U.S. Government to enhance that of the organization or to imply official sponsorship.</P>
            <P>(2) When the employee is a representative of an association consisting of IDCA employees, or of a group of such employees, the employee's connection with the agency may be freely used so long as there is no implication of official sponsorship beyond that which may have been officially approved.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Political activities abroad.</E> A U.S. citizen employee shall not engage in any form of political activity in any foreign country.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Activities relating to U.S. politics.</E> The law (5 U.S.C. 7324, formerly the Hatch Act) provides in summary that it is unlawful for any Federal employee <PRTPAGE P="375"/>of the executive branch to use the employee's official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the result thereof, or to take any active part in political management or in political campaigns. These restrictions do not in any way affect the right of a Federal employee (1) to vote as the employee chooses; (2) to express personal political opinions, except as part of a campaign; (3) to make or refrain from making contributions to political organizations, provided contributions are not made in a Federal building or to another Federal officer or employee (see 18 U.S.C. 602, 603, 607, and 608); (4) to participate in local, nonpartisan activities.</P>

Accordingly, official stationery should not be used for this purpose. The letter may, however, show the recommending employee's status as an employee of the U. S. Government. Every personal letter of recommendation shall contain a statement clearly indicating that the letter constitutes a personal recommendation and is not to be construed as an official recommendation by the Government of the United States.</P>

            <P>Each Statement of Employment and Financial Interests or annual supplement thereto must be accompanied by a full description of the employee's principal governmental duties. The description should be particularly detailed in regard to those duties which might possibly be an element in a conflict of interest.

            <P>(d) An employee is also to keep current the employee's description of principal duties as to changes or additions <PRTPAGE P="382"/>which might possibly be an element in a conflict of interest. The employing office shall submit descriptions of changes in the principal duties of a special Government employee as they occur.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review of statements and determination as to conflicts of interest.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) On the basis of the Statement of Employment and Financial Interests submitted by each employee or special Government employee, or on the basis of information received from other sources, the Counselor shall determine, in the light of the duties which that employee or special Government employee is or will be performing, whether any conflicts of interest, real or apparent, are indicated. The Counselor shall make this determination based on the applicable statutes, the Executive order, and the applicable regulations of the Civil Service Commission, and of the agency.</P>
            <P>(b) Where the Counselor's determination in a particular case is that a conflict of interest, real or apparent, is indicated, the Counselor shall initiate informal discussions with the employee or special Government employee concerned. These discussions shall have as their objectives:</P>
            <P>(1) Providing the individual with a full opportunity to explain the conflict or appearance of conflict; and</P>
            <P>(2) Arriving at an agreement (acceptable to the Counselor, the individual and the individual's immediate superior) whereby the conflict of interest may be removed or avoided. Such an agreement may include, but is not limited to: (i) Changes in assigned duties; (ii) divestiture of the financial or employment interest creating the conflict or apparent conflict; or (iii) disqualification for a particular assignment.</P>
            <P>(c) Where an acceptable agreement cannot be obtained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Counselor shall present findings and recommendations to the officer designated by the agency head, who shall decide which remedy is most appropriate to remove or correct that conflict or apparent conflict. Remedial action under this paragraph may include disciplinary action, including separation for cause, or any of the actions enumerated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and shall be effective in accordance with applicable laws, Executive orders, and regulations.</P>
            <P>(d) Written summaries of all agreements and decisions arrived at pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be placed in the Counselor's files. Copies shall also be made available to the employee or special Government employee concerned.</P>

            <P>An agency shall hold each statement of employment and financial interests, and each supplementary statement, in confidence. To insure this confidentiality only the Counselor and Deputy Counselors are authorized to review and retain the statements. The Counselor and Deputy Counselors are responsible for maintaining the statements in confidence and shall not allow access to, or allow information to be disclosed from, a statement except to carry out the purpose of this part. An agency may not disclose information from a statement except as the Civil Service Commission or the agency head may determine for good cause shown.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1203.735-410</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Effect of employees' statements on other requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The statements of employment and financial interests and supplementary statements required for employees are in addition to, and not in substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement imposed by law, order, or regulation. The submission of a statement or supplementary statement by an employee does not permit the employee or any other person to participate in a matter in which the employee or the other person's participation is prohibited by law, order, or regulation. Save with respect to those financial interests excepted from the conflict of interest prohibitions of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) pursuant to a written advance determination under § 1203.735-217 or exempted by the provisions of § 1203.735-205(c), an employee must disqualify himself or herself from participating in any matter in which the employee has a financial interest.</P>

            <PRTPAGE P="383"/>
            <SECTNO>§ 1203.735-411</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Disqualification procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where an employee is prohibited from participating in a matter because of a conflicting financial interest that is not exempt under § 1203.735-205(c) or has not been specifically excepted by the appropriate agency official pursuant to § 1203.735-217 in advance of the employee's participation in the particular matter, the employee shall conduct himself or herself in accordance with the following provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) The employee shall promptly disclose the financial interest in such matter to the employee's immediate superior. The superior will thereupon relieve the employee of duty and responsibility in the matter.</P>
            <P>(2) In foreign posts, it may be impossible or highly impracticable for an employee, who has a disqualifying financial interest, to assign the matter for official action to anyone other than a subordinate. In this event, the employee must instruct the subordinate to report fully and directly to the immediate superior to whom the employee himself or herself would normally report. The employee must concurrently direct such subordinate to take such action as may be appropriate in the matter, and without thereafter revealing to the disqualified employee in any way any aspect of the particular matter.</P>
            <P>(b) Nothing herein precludes the employee from disposing of such disqualifying financial interest, thereby wholly eliminating the conflict of interest. In some circumstances, where the employee may not obtain an exception under § 1203.735-217, or may not disqualify himself or herself and refer or assign the matter to another employee, the performance of duty may even require divestiture.</P>
            <P>(c) Where a supervisor has reason to believe that a subordinate employee may have a conflicting financial interest, the supervisor should discuss the matter with the employee. If the supervisor finds that a conflict of interest does exist, the supervisor must relieve the subordinate employee of duty and responsibility in the particular matter.</P>
            <P>(d) The obligation to avoid conflicts of interest is upon each employee. It is a continuing obligation calling for alert vigilance.</P>
            <P>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, if an employee's holdings rise in value above the amount exempted by § 1203.735-205(c), then the statutory and regulation prohibitions apply in a conflict of interest situation.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Educational requester.</E> A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> Certain categories of information that are not required to be released in response to a FOIA request because release would be harmful to governmental or private interests.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Fee waiver.</E> The waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">FOIA Appeals Officer.</E> The MCC employee who is responsible for conducting an independent review of the initial determination of the FOIA request after the requester has requested an administrative appeal.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">FOIA Public Liaison.</E> The MCC employee who is responsible for assisting in the resolution of disputes in response to FOIA requests.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">FOIA Program Officer.</E> The MCC employee who receives and processes requests within the MCC FOIA Office.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution.</E> An institution that does not operate on a commercial basis, but operates solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research and the results of the scientific research are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Record.</E> Any item, collection, or grouping of information maintained by MCC in any form or format, including an electronic copy. A “record” can potentially constitute an entire document, a single page of a multipage document, an individual paragraph of a document, or an email within an email chain.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Referral.</E> When an agency locates a record that originated with, or is of otherwise primary interest to another agency, it will forward that record to the other agency to process the record and to provide the final determination directly to the requester.</P>

The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.</P>

The review process also does not include time spent reviewing records at the administrative appeal level unless, MCC determines that the exemption under which it withheld records does not apply and the records are reviewed again to determine whether a different exemption may apply.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Requester category.</E> One of the three categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication, including commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.</P>
            <P>

            <P>Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the MCC website. MCC is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly available, identifying additional records in the interest of the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and posting such records.

            <P>(a) Requests for access to, or copies of, MCC records other than those identified in § 1304.3, shall be in writing and addressed to the MCC Chief FOIA Officer at 1099 14th St. NW, Washington, DC 20005 or <E T="03">FOIA@mcc.gov</E>. All requests for records shall be deemed to have been made pursuant to the FOIA, regardless of whether the request specifically mentions the Freedom of Information Act. To facilitate processing, the requester should place the phrase “FOIA REQUEST” in capital letters on the front of the envelope or subject line of the email.</P>
            <P>(b) Each request shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the record(s) that provides sufficient detail to enable MCC to locate the record(s) with a reasonable amount of effort; such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the MCC FOIA Program Officer to discuss the records the are seeking and receive assistance in describing the records;</P>
            <P>(2) The preferred format of the records;</P>
            <P>(3) The requestor's full name, mailing address or email address, and telephone number where the requester can be reached during business hours; and</P>
            <P>(4) If applicable, the maximum amount the requester is willing to pay or dollar limit on the fees MCC may incur to respond to the request for records. When this information is specified, MCC shall not exceed such limit.</P>
            <P>(c) If a request does not meet all of the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the FOIA Program Officer may advise the requester that additional information is needed. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify a request may engage with the MCC Program Officer to clarify their request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for acknowledgment and initial determinations.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Upon receipt of a request for records, the FOIA Program Officer will acknowledge receipt of the request in writing within ten (10) business days. In responding to a request for records, MCC shall make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic format, except when such efforts would <PRTPAGE P="391"/>significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system.</P>
            <P>(b) The Chief FOIA Officer shall make an initial determination, within twenty (20) business days, to either grant or deny, in whole or in part, a request for records. If the Chief FOIA Officer shall notify the requester making such a request of the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) The determination whether grant or deny the request and reasons for the determination;</P>
            <P>(2) The right of the requester to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison; and in the case of an adverse determination;</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1304.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General information.</E> The twenty (20) business day period identified in § 1304.5(b) shall commence on the date that the request is first received by the MCC FOIA office and an acknowledgment of the request shall be sent no later than ten (10) business days after receipt of the request. The twenty (20) business day period shall not be tolled except that MCC may make one request to the requester for information and toll the twenty (20) business day period while it is awaiting receipt of the information, or the twenty (20) business day period may be tolled if it is necessary to clarify issues regarding fees with the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> If MCC cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances” as defined in the FOIA and MCC extends the time limit on that basis, MCC will, before expiration of the twenty (20) business day period, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which MCC estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten (10) business days, MCC will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. MCC must make its designated FOIA Program Officer or FOIA Public Liaison available for this purpose. To aid the requester, the MCC FOIA Public Liaison shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and MCC, and notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> MCC may aggregate requests where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Requests that involve unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> MCC may use multitrack processing in responding to requests. This process entails separating simple requests that require rather limited review from more lengthy and complex requests. Requests in each track are then processed in their respective track. The FOIA Program Officer may provide requesters in the slower track an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to decrease the processing time required. The FOIA Program Officer may provide the opportunity to limit the scope of the request by contacting the requester by letter, email, or telephone.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Expedited processing of requests.</E> The FOIA Program Officer must determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt. Requests will receive expedited processing if one of the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(1) The requester can establish that failure to receive the records quickly could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>

            <P>(2) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information and can demonstrate that an urgency to inform the public concerning actual <PRTPAGE P="392"/>or alleged Federal Government activity exists; or</P>
            <P>(3) As determined by the Chief FOIA Officer.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Written expedited requests.</E> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a written statement explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. This statement must be certified to be true and correct. The MCC Chief FOIA Officer may waive the formal certification requirement.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of requests.</E> MCC shall acknowledge the request in writing and assign a tracking number for processing purposes.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.</E> Upon request, MCC shall provide an estimated response date. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, MCC shall provide interim responses by releasing the records on a rolling basis.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Granting requests.</E> MCC will notify the requestor in writing if it determines that it will grant a request in full or in part.

MCC shall take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Denial or adverse determination of requests.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this part, MCC shall withhold information only if—</P>
            <P>(1) It reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption under the FOIA or disclosure is prohibited by law;</P>
            <P>(2) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought;</P>
            <P>(3) The information sought is not a record subject to the FOIA;</P>
            <P>(4) The information sought does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or</P>
            <P>(5) The records are not in the readily producible form or format sought by the requester.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Markings on released documents.</E> Records disclosed in part shall be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.</P>

These designations shall expire ten (10) years after the date of submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Required notice.</E> Written notice shall be provided to a submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, it is determined that MCC may be required to disclose the records, provided:</P>
            <P>(1) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA; or</P>
            <P>(2) MCC has reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Information.</E> The notices shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records <PRTPAGE P="393"/>containing information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notices requirements of this section shall not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) The Chief FOIA Officer determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;</P>
            <P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or has officially been made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or</P>
            <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the component shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to the disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> A submitter may provide the Chief FOIA Officer with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure within ten (10) days of notification. The statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the FOIA, and if Exemption 4 applies, shall demonstrate the reasons the submitter believes the information to be confidential commercial information that is exempt from disclosure. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality shall be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the submitter. In the event a submitter fails to respond to the notice in the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is received after the disclosure decision has been made will not be considered. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The Chief FOIA Officer shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose the information requested. Whenever the Chief FOIA Officer determines that disclosure is appropriate, the Chief FOIA Officer shall, within a reasonable number of days prior to disclosure, provide the submitter with written notice of the intent to disclose which shall include a statement of the reasons for which the submitter's objections were overruled, a description of the information to be disclosed, and a specific disclosure date. The Chief FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester that the requested records will be made available.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of lawsuit.</E> If the requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, MCC shall promptly notify the submitter of this action.

The requester must submit a written notice of appeal and it must be postmarked or, in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted within ninety (90) calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the determination that is being appealed and the assigned tracking number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeals address.</E> Requesters can submit appeals by mail by addressing it to Millennium Challenge Corporation, Attn.: FOIA Appeals Officer, 1099 14th St. NW, Washington, DC 20005 or online at <E T="03">FOIA@mcc.gov</E>.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Final agency determinations.</E> The FOIA Appeals Officer shall issue a final written determination, stating the basis for the decision, within twenty (20) business days after receipt of a notice of appeal. Any decision that upholds MCC's determination in whole or in part must contain a statement that identifies the reason(s) for the decision, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the OGIS of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Chief FOIA Officer's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the FOIA Appeals Officer will notify the requester of the determination in writing. MCC will then further process the request in accordance with the appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS.</E> Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If MCC agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, MCC will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General information.</E> (1) MCC's fee provisions are governed by the FOIA and by the Office of Management and Budget's Uniform FOIA Fee Schedule and Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes the following categories of requesters:</P>
            <P>(i) Commercial use;</P>
            <P>(ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions;</P>
            <P>(iii) Representative of the news media; and</P>
            <P>(iv) All other requesters.</P>

            <P>(2) Fees will be assessed pursuant to the category of requester and detailed in paragraph (b) of this section. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, MCC may contact a requester for additional information. MCC will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. MCC ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees to the Treasury of the United States. All fee information is available at <E T="03">www.mcc.gov/resources/foia</E>.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Charging fees.</E> Because the fee amounts provided already account for the direct costs associated with the given fee type, MCC will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section. In responding to FOIA requests, MCC shall charge fees for the following unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search time fees.</E> Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.</P>
            <P>(i) Requests made by education institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search time fees. Search time fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions identified in this section. MCC may properly charge for time spent searching even if no responsive records are located if it is determined that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>

            <P>(ii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting <PRTPAGE P="395"/>any searches that require the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.</P>
            <P>(iii) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an agency at the Federal Records Centers operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Range Schedule established by NARA.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication fees.</E> Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions in this section. MCC shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by MCC in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, MCC shall provide one copy per request and charge fees calculated per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, MCC shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall be charged direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, MCC shall charge the direct costs.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal state of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. If a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with MCC's subsequent review following the administrative appeal of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> The following restrictions shall apply to MCC FOIA requests:</P>
            <P>(1) If MCC fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits to respond to a request, MCC may not charge fees, except as described in paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) If MCC has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional ten (10) calendar days;</P>
            <P>(3) If MCC has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and more than five-thousand (5,000) pages are necessary to respond to the request, MCC may charge search time fees or duplication fees where applicable, if MCC has provided timely written notice of the unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and has discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made a minimum of three (3) good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request;</P>
            <P>(4) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order; and</P>
            <P>(5) No search time or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Fee exceptions.</E> Except for requesters seeking records for commercial use, MCC shall provide without charge:</P>
            <P>(1) The first one-hundred (100) pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and</P>
            <P>(2) The first two (2) hours of search time. When, after deducting the first one-hundred (100) free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two (2) hours of search time, a total fee calculated under this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> (1) When MCC determines that the fees to be assessed will exceed $25.00, the requester shall be notified of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including the breakdown of the fees for search time, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of <PRTPAGE P="396"/>the fee can be estimated readily, MCC shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is not a commercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory requirements of one-hundred (100) pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search time fees, two (2) hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.</P>
            <P>(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits, in writing, to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a requester who is not a commercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. MCC is not required to accept payments in installments.</P>
            <P>(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, and MCC estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, MCC shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. MCC shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.</P>
            <P>(4) The FOIA Program Officer will assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a charge below that listed in this section based upon information provided by a requester or otherwise made known to the Chief FOIA Officer that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. Disclosure is in the public interest if it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and is not primarily for commercial purposes. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case by case basis. Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted to those records. In order to determine whether the fee waiver requirement is met, the Chief FOIA Officer shall consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) The subject of the request. Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;</P>
            <P>(2) The informative value of the information to be disclosed; and</P>
            <P>(3) The significance of the contribution to public understanding.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Fees pending a waiver request.</E> Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the agency and should address the criteria referenced in this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Types of requesters.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institutional requesters; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The following specific levels of fees are prescribed for each of these categories:</P>
            <P>(1) Commercial requesters shall be charged the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records;</P>

            <P>(2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters shall be charged for document duplication only and the first one-hundred (100) pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge;<PRTPAGE P="397"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Representative of the news media requesters shall be charged for document duplication costs only, except that the first one-hundred (100) pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge; and</P>
            <P>(4) All other requesters who do not fall into any of the categories in paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this section shall be charged fees which recover the full reasonable direct costs incurred for searching for and reproducing records if that total costs exceeds $25.00, except that the first one-hundred (100) pages of duplication and the first two hours of manual search time shall not be charged.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful searches.</E> If the requester has been notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been advised specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be withheld as exempt, fees may be charged.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> Although MCC is not required to provide special services, if it chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> MCC may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received. MCC shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> The requester or a group of requesters may not submit multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the FOIA Program Officer reasonably believes that a requester is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests to evade an assessment of fees, the FOIA Program Officer may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly. MCC may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a thirty (30) calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, MCC will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Advance payment of fees.</E> (1) MCC may require an advanced payment of fees if the requestor previously failed to pay fees or if the FOIA Program Officer determines the total fee will exceed $250.00. When payment is required in advance of the processing of a request, the time limits prescribed in § 1304.5 shall not be deemed to begin until the requester has paid the assessed fees.</P>
            <P>(2) In cases in which MCC requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the fee determination, the request will be closed. Where it is anticipated that the cost of providing the requested record will exceed $25.00 but falls below $250.00 after the free duplication and search time has been calculated, MCC may, in its discretion may require either an advance deposit of the entire estimated charges or written confirmation of the requester's willingness to pay such charges.</P>
            <P>(3) Where the requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within thirty (30) calendar days of the billing date, MCC may require the requester to pay the full amount due plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and/or require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of the anticipated fee before MCC begins a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. If MCC has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, MCC may require that the requester provide proof of identity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 301, the head of an executive department or military department may prescribe regulations for the government of his/her department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of its records, papers, and property. Section 301 does not authorize withholding information from the public or limiting the availability of records to the public. This part contains the regulations of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) concerning procedures to be followed when a request, subpoena, order or other demand (hereinafter in this part referred to as a “demand”) of a court or other authorities in any state or federal proceeding is issued for the production or disclosure of:</P>
          <P>(a) Any material contained in the files of MCC;</P>
          <P>(b) Any information relating to materials contained in the files of MCC; or</P>
          <P>(c) Any information or material acquired by an employee of MCC during the performance of the employee's official duties or because of the employee's official status.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Document</E> means any record or other property, no matter what media and including copies thereof, held by MCC, including without limitation, official letters, telegrams, memoranda, reports, studies, calendar and diary entries, maps, graphs, pamphlets, notes, charts, tabulations, analyses, statistical or informational accumulations, any kind of summaries of meetings and conversations, film impressions, magnetic tapes and sound or mechanical reproductions.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Employee</E> means all employees and officers of MCC, including contractors who have been appointed by, or are subject to the supervision, jurisdiction or control of MCC. The procedures established within this part also apply to former employees and contractors of MCC.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Production prohibited unless approved.</SUBJECT>
          <P>No employee or former employee shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority, disclose any information relating to materials contained in the files of MCC, or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of the performance of the person's official duties, or because of the person's official status, without the prior, written approval of the General Counsel.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1305.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Factors to be considered by the General Counsel.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In deciding whether to authorize the release of official information or the testimony of employees concerning official information, the General Counsel shall consider the following factors:</P>
          <P>(1) Whether the demand is unduly burdensome;</P>
          <P>(2) MCC's ability to maintain impartiality in conducting its business;</P>
          <P>(3) Whether the time and money of the United States would be used for private purposes;</P>
          <P>(4) The extent to which the time of employees for conducting official business would be compromised;</P>
          <P>(5) Whether the public might misconstrue variances between personal opinions of employees and MCC policy;</P>
          <P>(6) Whether the demand demonstrates that the information requested is relevant and material to the action pending, genuinely necessary to the proceeding, unavailable from other sources, and reasonable in its scope;</P>
          <P>(7) Whether the number of similar demands would have a cumulative effect on the expenditure of agency resources;</P>
          <P>(8) Whether disclosure otherwise would be inappropriate under the circumstances; and</P>
          <P>(9) Any other factor that is appropriate.</P>
          <P>(b) Among those demands in response to which compliance will not ordinarily be authorized are those with respect to which any of the following factors exists:</P>
          <P>(1) The disclosure would violate a statute, Executive order, or regulation;</P>
          <P>(2) The integrity of the administrative and deliberative processes of MCC would be compromised;</P>
          <P>(3) The disclosure would not be appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;</P>
          <P>(4) The disclosure, including release in camera, is not appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;</P>
          <P>(5) The disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information properly classified or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; or</P>
          <P>(6) The disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, or disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential commercial or financial information.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1305.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Service of demands.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Demands for official documents, information or testimony must be in writing, and served on the General Counsel, Millennium Challenge Corporation, 875 Fifteenth Street NW., Washington, DC 20005-2221.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1305.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Processing demands.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) After service of a demand to produce or disclose official documents and information, the General Counsel will review the demand and, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, determine whether, or under what conditions, to authorize the employee to testify on matters relating to official information and/or produce official documents.</P>
          <P>(b) If information or material is sought by a demand in any case or matter in which MCC is not a party, an affidavit or, if that is not feasible, a statement by the party seeking the information or material, or by his/her attorney setting forth a summary of the information or material sought and its relevance to the proceeding, must be submitted before a decision is made as to whether materials will be produced or permission to testify or otherwise provide information will be granted. Any authorization for testimony by a present or former employee of MCC shall be limited to the scope of the demand.</P>
          <P>(c) When necessary, the General Counsel will coordinate with the Department of Justice to file appropriate motions, including motions to remove the matter to Federal court, to quash, or to obtain a protective order.</P>
          <P>(d) If a demand fails to follow the requirements of these regulations, MCC will not allow the testimony or produce the documents.</P>

          <P>(e) MCC will process demands in the order in which they are received. Absent unusual circumstances, MCC will respond within 45 days of the date that the demand was received. The time for <PRTPAGE P="400"/>response will depend upon the scope of the demand.</P>
          <P>(f) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this subpart where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of MCC or the United States or for other good cause.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1305.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Final determination.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The General Counsel makes the final determination on demands to employees for production of official documents and information or testimony. All final determinations are within the sole discretion of the General Counsel. The General Counsel will notify the requester and the Court or other authority of the final determination, the reasons for the grant or denial of the demand, and any conditions that the General Counsel may impose on the release of documents, or on the testimony of an employee. When in doubt about the propriety of granting or denying a demand for testimony or documents, the General Counsel should consult with the Department of Justice.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1305.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Restrictions that apply to testimony.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the testimony of MCC employees including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that the transcript of the testimony will be kept under seal or will only be used or made available in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was requested. The General Counsel may also require a copy of the transcript of testimony at the requester's expense.</P>
          <P>(b) MCC may offer the employee's declaration in lieu of testimony, in whatever form the court finds acceptable.</P>
          <P>(c) If authorized to testify pursuant to this part, an employee may testify to relevant unclassified materials or information within his or her personal knowledge, but, unless specifically authorized to do so by the General Counsel, the employee shall not:</P>
          <P>(1) Disclose confidential or privileged information; or</P>
          <P>(2) For a current MCC employee, testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of MCC, unless testimony is being given on behalf of the United States.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1305.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Restrictions that apply to released documents.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of official documents and information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of the confidentiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, MCC may condition the release of official documents and information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.</P>
          <P>(b) If the General Counsel so determines, original MCC documents may be presented in response to a demand, but they are not to be presented as evidence or otherwise used in a manner by which they could lose their identity as official MCC documents nor are they to be marked or altered. In lieu of original records, certified copies will be presented for evidentiary purposes. (See 28 U.S.C. 1733).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1305.10</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedure when a decision is not made prior to the time a response is required.</SUBJECT>
          <P>If a response to a demand is required before the General Counsel can make the determination referred to above, the General Counsel, when necessary, will provide the court or other competent authority with a copy of this part, inform the court or other competent authority that the demand is being reviewed, and respectfully seek a stay of the demand pending a final determination.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.</SUBJECT>

          <P>If the court or other competent authority declines to stay the demand in <PRTPAGE P="401"/>response to a request made in accordance with § 1305.10, or if the court or other competent authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of the instructions from the General Counsel not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand (<E T="03">United States ex rel. Touhy</E> v. <E T="03">Ragen,</E> 340 U.S. 462 (1951)).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1306.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Collection in installments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Whenever feasible, and except as required otherwise by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest, penalties, and administrative costs as required by this part, should be collected in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected under administrative offset, including salary offset, or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum or the amount of debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval collection must be made in regular installments. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within three years, and in the case of a current MCC employee, installment repayment plans must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment, except as provided in paragraph (b) in this section. However, the amount deducted for any period under this section and § 1306.16 may not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount or a higher deduction has been ordered by a court.</P>
            <P>(b) If the employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, MCC may collect the debt from subsequent payments of any nature (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.) due the employee from the paying agency as of the date of separation to the extent necessary to liquidate the debt. Following the employee's separation, MCC may collect any later payments of any kind that are due to the former employee from the United States to the extent necessary to liquidate the debt.</P>

The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and MCC, and documented in MCC's files;</P>

            <P>(7) The employee's right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, an individual not under the <PRTPAGE P="405"/>supervision or control of MCC, but in each case arranged by MCC) with respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed, or the repayment schedule, so long as a petition is filed by the employee in accordance with this part;</P>

            <P>(12) That MCC will initiate certification procedures to implement a salary offset, as appropriate, (which may not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay) not less than 30 calendar days from the date of delivery of the notice of debt, unless the employee files a timely petition for a hearing;</P>
            <P>(13) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 calendar days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;</P>
            <P>(14) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representation, or evidence may subject the employee to disciplinary procedures (5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752 or other applicable statutes or regulations); penalties (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731 or other applicable statutes or regulations); or criminal penalties (18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or other applicable statutes or regulations);</P>
            <P>(15) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made;</P>
            <P>(16) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee; and</P>

            <P>(2) A routine adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting the adjustment; or</P>
            <P>(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt of $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature of the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting the adjustment.</P>

            <P>(c) The employee must also specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.</P>
            <P>(d) If the employee files a request for a hearing later than the required 15 calendar days as described in paragraph (a) of this section, MCC may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee otherwise has actual notice of the filing deadline).</P>
            <P>(e) If the employee files a timely request for reconsideration pursuant to § 1306.13(b), the employee must file a request for a hearing by the official identified in the notice provided pursuant to § 1306.12(a)(11) not later than 15 calendar days from the date of MCC's written decision concerning the reconsideration request.</P>
            <P>(f) An employee waives the right to a hearing and will have his or her pay offset if the employee fails to file a petition for a hearing in accordance with this section.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1306.15</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If an employee timely files a request for a hearing under § 1306.14, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2), the hearing official shall select the time, date, and location of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) Hearings shall be conducted by a hearing official not under the supervision or control of MCC or an administrative law judge.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (1) After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Paper hearing.</E> If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a review of the available written record.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Record.</E> The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any <PRTPAGE P="407"/>hearing provided by this subpart. Witnesses who provide testimony will do so under oath or affirmation.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Content of decision.</E> The written decision shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary offset will commence, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(6) Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown (e.g., excused illness), an employee who fails to appear at an oral hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this part, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. The hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date upon the request of MCC's representative when good cause is shown.</P>
            <P>(d) A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Unless otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or contract, the following procedures apply to salary offset:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Method.</E> Salary offset will be made by deduction at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of the employee without his or her consent.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Source.</E> The source of salary offset is current disposable pay.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Types of collection.</E> (1) <E T="03">Lump sum payment.</E> Ordinarily debts will be collected by salary offset in one lump sum if possible. However, if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the collection by salary offset must be made in installment deductions, except as provided by other laws or regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to a greater amount.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> (i) The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. If possible, the size of the deduction will be that necessary to liquidate the debt in no more than 1 year. However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, except as provided by other laws or regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to a greater amount.</P>
            <P>(ii) Installment payments of less than $50 per pay period will be accepted only in unusual circumstances such as when that amount exceeds 15% of disposable pay.</P>
            <P>(iii) Installment deductions should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within three years and must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Non-waiver of rights by payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>So long as there are no statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary, no employee payment (of all or a portion of a debt) collected under this part will be interpreted as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Waiver of indebtedness.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An employee may request a waiver of indebtedness. When an employee makes a request under a statutory right, further collection may be stayed pending an administrative determination on the request. During the period of any suspension, interest, penalties and administrative charges may be held in abeyance. MCC will not duplicate, for purposes of salary offset, any of the notices/procedures already provided the debtor prior to a request for waiver.</P>
            <P>(b) Waiver of indebtedness is an equitable remedy and as such must be based on an assessment of the facts involved in the individual case under consideration. The burden is on the employee to demonstrate that the applicable waiver standard has been met in accordance with MCC's Policy on Waivers of Indebtedness.</P>

            <P>(c) A debtor requesting a waiver shall do so in writing to the official identified in § 1306.12(a)(8) and within the timeframe stated within the initial notice sent under § 1306.12. The debtor's <PRTPAGE P="408"/>written response shall state the basis for the dispute and include any relevant documentation in support.</P>
            <P>(d) While a waiver request is pending, MCC may suspend collection, including the accrual of interest and penalties, on the debt if MCC determines that suspension is in the agency's best interest or would serve equity and good conscience.</P>

            <P>Once a debt has been closed out for accounting purposes and collection has been terminated, the debt is discharged. MCC must report discharged debt as income to the debtor to the Internal Revenue Service per 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1.</P>

            <P>A debtor should notify MCC at the contact office provided in the original notice of the debt, if the debtor has filed for bankruptcy. MCC will require documentation from the applicable court indicating the date of filing and type of bankruptcy. Pursuant to the laws of bankruptcy, MCC will suspend debt collection upon such filing unless the automatic stay is no longer in effect or has been lifted. In general, collection of a debt discharged in bankruptcy shall be terminated unless otherwise provided for by bankruptcy law.</P>

            <P>(1) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or</P>
            <P>(2) MCC is directed by an administrative or judicial order to make a refund.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Action necessary to close meeting; record of votes.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A meeting shall be closed to public observation under § 1413.4, only when a majority of the members of the Board who will participate in the meeting vote to take such action.</P>
            <P>(a) When the meeting deliberations concern matters specified in § 1413.4(a), the Board members shall vote at the beginning of the meeting, or portion thereof, on whether to close such meeting, or portion thereof, to public observation and on whether the public interest requires that a meeting which may properly be closed should nevertheless be open to public observation. A record of such vote, reflecting the vote of each member of the Board, shall be kept and made available to the public at the earliest practicable time.</P>
            <P>(b) When the meeting deliberations concern matters specified in § 1413.4(b), the Board shall vote on whether to close such meeting, or portion thereof, to public observation, and on whether there is a public interest which requires that a meeting which may properly be closed should nevertheless be open to public observation. The vote shall be taken at a time sufficient to permit inclusion of information concerning the open or closed status of the meeting in the public announcement thereof. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings at which the deliberations will concern the same particular matters where such subsequent meetings are scheduled to be held within thirty (30) days after the initial meeting. A record of such vote, reflecting the vote of each member of the Board, shall be kept and made available for the public within one (1) day after the vote is taken.</P>
            <P>(c) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by deliberations during a meeting, or a portion thereof, requests that the Board close that meeting, or portion thereof, to public observation for any of the reasons specified in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(5) (matters of alleged criminal conduct or formal censure), (c)(6) (personal information where disclosure would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy), or (c)(7) (certain materials or information from investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes), the Board members participating in the meeting, upon request of any one of its members, shall vote on whether to close such meeting, or a portion thereof, for that reason. A record of such vote, reflecting the vote of each member of the Board participating in the meeting, shall be kept and made available to the public within one (1) day after the vote is taken.</P>
            <P>(d) After public announcement of a meeting as provided in § 1413.6, a meeting, or portion thereof, announced as closed may be opened, or a meeting, or portion thereof, announced as open may be closed only if a majority of the members of the Board who will participate in the meeting determine by a recorded vote that Board business so requires and that an earlier announcement of the change was not possible. The change made and the vote of each member on the change shall be announced publicly at the earliest practicable time.</P>
            <P>(e) Before a meeting may be closed pursuant to § 1413.4, the Solicitor of the Authority shall certify that in the Solicitor's opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation. The certification shall set forth each applicable exemptive provision for such closing. Such certification shall be retained by the agency and made publicly available as soon as practicable.</P>

            <P>(b) Except for meetings closed to public observation pursuant to the provisions of § 1413.4(a), the agency shall make public announcement of each meeting to be held at least seven (7) days before the scheduled date of the meeting.

            <P>(c) When a collective bargaining agreement covering the unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112 has been signed and dated by the Department and the incumbent exclusive representative, a petition for exclusive recognition or other election petition will not be considered timely if filed during the period of review by the Secretary as set forth in 22 U.S.C. 4113(f), absent unusual circumstances.</P>

            <P>(a) No labor organization will be permitted to intervene in any proceeding involving a petition filed pursuant to § 1422.2 (a) or (b) unless it has submitted to the Regional Director a showing of interest of ten percent (10%) or more of the employees in the unit described in 22 U.S.C. 4112 together with an alphabetical list of names constituting such showing, or has submitted a current or recently expired agreement with the Department covering any of the employees involved, or has submitted evidence that it is currently recognized or certified exclusive representative of any of the employees involved: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That an incumbent exclusive representative shall be deemed to be an intervenor in the proceeding unless it serves on the Regional Director a written disclaimer of any representation interest for the employees involved: <E T="03">Provided, further,</E> That any such incumbent exclusive representative that declines to sign an agreement for consent election because of a disagreement on the matters contained in § 1422.7(c) as decided by the Regional Director, or fails to appear at a hearing held pursuant to § 1422.9, shall be denied its status as an intervenor.</P>

            <P>(b) No labor organization may participate to any extent in any representation proceeding unless it has notified the Regional Director in writing, accompanied by its showing of interest as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, of its desire to intervene within twenty (20) days after the initial date of posting of the notice of petition as provided in § 1422.4(a), unless good <PRTPAGE P="430"/>cause is shown for extending the period.

            <P>(c) Any labor organization seeking to intervene in a proceeding involving a petition for determination of eligibility for dues allotment filed pursuant to § 1422.2(d) may intervene solely on the basis it claims to be the exclusive representative of some or all the employees specified in the petition and shall submit to the Regional Director a current or recently expired agreement with the Department covering any of the employees involved, or evidence that it is the currently recognized or certified exclusive representative of any of the employees involved.</P>
            <P>(d) Any labor organization seeking to intervene must submit to the Regional Director a statement that it has submitted to the Department and to the Assistant Secretary a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its constitution and bylaws, and a statement of its objectives.</P>

            <P>(e) When the Regional Director determines that no relevant question of fact exists, but that a substantial question of interpretation or policy exists, the Regional Director shall notify the parties in the report and findings and transfer the case to the Board in accordance with of this subchapter.</P>

            <P>(f) Any party aggrieved by the findings of a Regional Director with respect to objections to an election or challenged ballots may obtain a review of such action by the Board by following the procedure set forth in § 1422.6(d) of this subchapter: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That a determination by the Regional Director to issue a notice of hearing shall not be subject to review by the Board.</P>
            <P>(g) Where it appears to the Regional Director that the objections or challenged ballots raise any relevant question of fact which may have affected the results of the election, the Regional Director shall cause to be issued a notice of hearing. Hearings shall be conducted and decisions issued by Administrative Law Judges and exceptions and related submissions filed with the Board in accordance with §§ 1423.14 through 1423.28 of this subchapter excluding § 1423.18 and § 1423.19(j), with the following exceptions:</P>

            <P>(2) Reference to “charge, complaint” in § 1423.26(b) shall be read as “report and findings of the Regional Director.”</P>
            <P>(h) At a hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section the party filing the objections shall have the burden of proving all matters alleged in its objections by a preponderance of the evidence. With respect to challenged ballots, no burden of proof is imposed on any party.</P>
            <P>(i) The Board shall take action which may consist of the following, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) Issue a decision adopting, modifying, or rejecting the Administrative Law Judge's decision;</P>
            <P>(2) Issue a decision in any case involving a substantial question of interpretation or policy transferred pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; or</P>

            <P>(a) The purposes and policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute can best be achieved by the cooperative efforts of all persons covered by the program. To this end, it shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage all persons alleging unfair labor practices and persons against whom such allegations are made to meet and, in good faith, attempt to resolve such matters prior to the filing of unfair labor practice charges with the Board.</P>
            <P>(b) In furtherance of the policy referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, and noting the six (6) month period of limitation set forth in 22 U.S.C. 4116(d), it shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage the informal resolution of unfair labor practice allegations subsequent to the filing of a charge and prior to the issuance of a complaint by the Regional Director.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1423.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Who may file charges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Department or labor organization may be charged by any person with having engaged in or engaging in any unfair labor practice prohibited under 22 U.S.C. 4115.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1423.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and documents.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A charge alleging a violation of 22 U.S.C. 4115 shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the Board and shall contain the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The name, address and telephone number of the person(s) making the charge;</P>
            <P>(2) The name, address and telephone number of the Department or labor organization against whom the charge is made;</P>

            <P>(3) A clear and concise statement of the facts constituting the alleged unfair labor practice, a statement of the <PRTPAGE P="437"/>section(s) and subsection(s) of chapter 41 of title 22 of the United States Code alleged to have been violated, and the date and place of occurrence of the particular acts; and</P>
            <P>(4) A statement of any other procedure invoked involving the subject matter of the charge and the results, if any, including whether the subject matter raised in the charge (i) has been raised previously in a grievance procedure; (ii) has been referred to the Foreign Service Impasse Disputes Panel or the Foreign Service Grievance Board for consideration or action; or (iii) involves a negotiability issue raised by the charging party in a petition pending before the Board pursuant to part 1424 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(b) Such charge shall be in writing and signed and shall contain a declaration by the person signing the charge, under the penalties of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), that its contents are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief.</P>
            <P>(c) When filing a charge, the charging party shall submit to the Regional Director any supporting evidence and documents.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1423.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or the negotiability procedure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to this part which involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to part 1424 of this subchapter a petition for review of the same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge and the petition for review simultaneously.</P>
            <P>(b) Under such circumstances, the labor organization must select under which procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this selection must be made in writing at the time that both procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the Board, the appropriate Regional Director and all parties to both the unfair labor practice case and the negotiability case.</P>
            <P>(c) Cases which solely involve an agency's allegation that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be filed under part 1424 of this subchapter.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1423.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Filing and service of copies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An original and four (4) copies of the charge together with one copy for each additional charged party named shall be filed with the Regional Director for the region in which the alleged unfair labor practice has occurred or is occurring. A charge alleging that an unfair labor practice has occurred or is occurring in two or more regions may be filed with the Regional Director for any such region.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon the filing of a charge, the charging party shall be responsible for the service of a copy of the charge (without the supporting evidence and documents) upon the person(s) against whom the charge is made, and for filing a written statement of such service with the Regional Director. The Regional Director will, as a matter of course, cause a copy of such charge to be served on the person(s) against whom the charge is made, but shall not be deemed to assume responsibility for such service.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Investigation of charges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Regional Director, on behalf of the General Counsel, shall conduct such investigation of the charge as the Regional Director deems necessary.</P>
            <P>(b) During the course of the investigation all parties involved will have an opportunity to present their evidence and views to the Regional Director.</P>
            <P>(c) In connection with the investigation of charges, all persons are expected to cooperate fully with the Regional Director.</P>

            <P>(d) The purposes and policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute can best be achieved by the full cooperation of all parties involved and the voluntary submission of all potentially relevant information <PRTPAGE P="438"/>from all potential sources during the course of the investigation. To this end, it shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to protect the identity of individuals and the substance of the statements and information they submit or which is obtained during the investigation as a means of assuring the Board's and the General Counsel's continuing ability to obtain all relevant information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Amendment of charges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Prior to the issuance of a complaint, the charging party may amend the charge in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 1423.6.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1423.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Action by the Regional Director.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Regional Director shall take action which may consist of the following, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) Approve a request to withdraw a charge;</P>
            <P>(2) Refuse to issue a complaint;</P>
            <P>(3) Approve a written settlement agreement in accordance with the provisions of § 1423.11;</P>
            <P>(4) Issue a complaint;</P>
            <P>(5) Upon agreement of all parties, transfer to the Board for decision, after issuance of a complaint, a stipulation of facts in accordance with the provisions of § 1429.1(a) this subchapter; or</P>
            <P>(6) Withdraw a complaint.</P>
            <P>(b) Parties may request the General Counsel to seek appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) under 22 U.S.C. 4109(d). The General Counsel will initiate and prosecute injunctive proceedings under 22 U.S.C. 4109(d) only upon approval of the Board. A determination by the General Counsel not to seek approval of the Board for such temporary relief is final and may not be applied to the Board.</P>
            <P>(c) Upon a determination to issue a complaint, whenever it is deemed advisable by the Board to seek appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) under 22 U.S.C. 4109(d), the Regional Attorney or other designated agent of the Board to whom the matter has been referred will make application for appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Such temporary relief will not be sought unless the record establishes probable cause that an unfair labor practice is being committed, or if such temporary relief will interfere with the ability of the Department to carry out its essential functions.</P>
            <P>(d) Whenever temporary relief has been obtained pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4109(d) and thereafter the Administrative Law Judge hearing the complaint, upon which the determination to seek such temporary relief was predicated, recommends dismissal of such complaint, in whole or in part, the Regional Attorney or other designated agent of the Board handling the case for the Board shall inform the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of the possible change in circumstances arising out of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1423.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Determination not to issue complaint; review of action by the Regional Director.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the Regional Director determines that the charge has not been timely filed, that the charge fails to state an unfair labor practice, or for other appropriate reasons, the Regional Director may request the charging party to withdraw the charge, and in the absence of such withdrawal within a reasonable time, decline to issue a complaint.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Regional Director determines not to issue a complaint on a charge which is not withdrawn, the Regional Director shall provide the parties with a written statement of the reasons for not issuing a complaint.</P>

            <P>(c) The charging party may obtain a review of the Regional Director's decision not to issue a complaint by filing an appeal with the General Counsel within twenty-five (25) days after service of the Regional Director's decision. The appeal shall contain a complete statement setting forth the facts and reasons upon which it is based. A copy of the appeal shall also be filed with the Regional Director. In addition, the charging party should notify all other parties of the fact that an appeal has been taken, but any failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the appeal.<PRTPAGE P="439"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) A request for extension of time to file an appeal shall be in writing and received by the General Counsel not later than five (5) days before the date the appeal is due. The charging party should notify the Regional Director and all other parties that it has requested an extension of time in which to file an appeal, but any failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of its request for an extension of time to file an appeal.</P>
            <P>(e) The General Counsel may sustain the Regional Director's refusal to issue or re-issue a complaint, stating the grounds of affirmance, or may direct the Regional Director to take further action. The General Counsel's decision shall be served on all the parties. The decision of the General Counsel shall be final.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">general settlement policy</HD>
            <P>(a) At any stage of a proceeding prior to hearing, where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity to submit to the Regional Director with whom the charge was filed, for consideration, all facts and arguments concerning offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">precomplaint informal settlements</HD>
            <P>(b)(1) Prior to the issuance of any complaint or the taking of other formal action, the Regional Director will afford the charging party and the respondent a reasonable period of time in which to enter into an informal settlement agreement to be approved by the Regional Director. Upon approval by the Regional Director and compliance with the terms of the informal settlement agreement, no further action shall be taken in the case. If the respondent fails to perform its obligations under the informal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may determine to institute further proceedings.</P>
            <P>(2) In the event that the charging party fails or refuses to become a party to an informal settlement agreement offered by the respondent, if the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the respondent and the Regional Director and the latter shall decline to issue a complaint. The charging party may obtain a review of the Regional Director's action by filing an appeal with the General Counsel in accordance with § 1423.10(c). The General Counsel shall take action on such appeal as set forth in § 1423.10(e).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">post complaint settlement policy</HD>
            <P>(c) Consistent with the policy reflected in paragraph (a) of this section, even after the issuance of a complaint, the Board favors the settlement of issues. Such settlements may be either informal or formal. Informal settlement agreements shall be accomplished as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Formal settlement agreements are subject to the approval of the Board. In such formal settlement agreements, the parties shall agree to waive their right to a hearing and agree further that the Board may issue an order requiring the respondent to take action appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily the formal settlement agreement also contains the respondent's consent to the Board application for the entry of a decree by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia enforcing the Board's order.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">post complaint—prehearing formal settlements</HD>
            <P>(d)(1) If, after issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, the charging party and the respondent enter into a formal settlement agreement, and such agreement is accepted by the Regional Director, the formal settlement agreement shall be submitted to the Board for approval.</P>

            <P>(2) If, after issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, the charging party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the respondent, and the Regional Director concludes <PRTPAGE P="440"/>that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the respondent and the Regional Director. The charging party will be so informed and provided a brief written statement by the Regional Director of the reasons therefor. The formal settlement agreement together with the charging party's objections, if any, and the Regional Director's written statements, shall be submitted to the Board for approval. The Board may approve or disapprove any formal settlement agreement or return the case to the Regional Director for other appropriate action.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">post complaint—prehearing informal settlements</HD>
            <P>(3) After the issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, if the Regional Director concludes that it will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director may withdraw the complaint and approve an informal settlement agreement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">informal settlements after the opening of the hearing</HD>
            <P>(e)(1) After issuance of a complaint and after opening of the hearing, if the Regional Director concludes that it will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge for permission to withdraw the complaint and, having been granted such permission to withdraw the complaint, may approve an informal settlement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">formal settlements after the opening of the hearing</HD>
            <P>(2) If, after issuance of a complaint and after opening of the hearing, the parties enter into a formal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Board for approval.</P>
            <P>(3) If the charging party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the respondent and the Regional Director. After the charging party is given an opportunity to state on the record or in writing the reasons for opposing the formal settlement, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Board for approval. The Board may approve or disapprove any formal settlement agreement or return the case to the Administrative Law Judge for another appropriate action.</P>

            <P>(a) After a charge is filed, if it appears to the Regional Director that formal proceedings in respect thereto should be instituted, the Regional Director shall issue and cause to be served on all other parties a formal complaint: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That a determination by a Regional Director to issue a complaint shall not be subject to review.</P>
            <P>(b) The complaint shall include:</P>

            <P>(d) A complaint may be amended, upon such terms as may be deemed just, prior to the hearing, by the Regional Director issuing the complaint; at the hearing and until the case has been transmitted to the Board pursuant to § 1423.26, upon motion by the Administrative Law Judge designated to conduct the hearing; and after the case has been transmitted to the Board pursuant to § 1423.26, upon motion by the Board at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon by the Board.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or the negotiability procedure.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 1423 of this subchapter which involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to this part a petition for review of the same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such circumstances, the labor organization must select under which procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, further action under the other <PRTPAGE P="447"/>procedure will ordinarily be suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this selection must be made in writing at the time that both procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the Board, the appropriate Regional Director and all parties to both the unfair labor practice case and the negotiability case. Cases which solely involve the Department's allegation that the duty bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be filed under this part.</P>

If the Board finds such a failure to comply with its order, the Board shall take whatever action it deems necessary, including enforcement under 22 U.S.C. 4109(b).</P>

              <P>(a) In any representation case under part 1422 of this subchapter in which the Regional Director determines, based upon a stipulation by the parties, that no material issue of fact exists, the Regional Director may transfer the case to the Board; and the Board may decide the case on the basis of the papers alone after having allowed twenty-five (25) days for the filing of briefs. In any unfair labor practice case under part 1423 of this subchapter in which, after the issuance of a complaint, the Regional Director determines, based upon a stipulation by the parties, that no material issue of fact exists, the Regional Director may upon agreement of all parties transfer the case to the Board; and the Board shall decide the case on the basis of the case papers alone after having allowed twenty-five (25) days for the filing of briefs. The Board may remand any such case to the Regional Director if it determines that a material question of fact does exist. Orders of transfer and remand shall be served on all parties.</P>
              <P>(b) In any case under parts 1422 and 1423 of this subchapter in which it appears to the Regional Director that the proceedings raise questions which should be decided by the Board, the Regional Director may, at any time, issue an order transferring the case to the Board for decision or other appropriate action. Such an order shall be served on the parties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Subpoenas.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any member of the Board, the General Counsel, any Administrative Law Judge appointed by the Board under 5 U.S.C. 3105, and any Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or other employee of the Board designated by the Board may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary or other evidence. However, no subpoena shall be issued under this section which requires the disclosure of intramanagement guidance, advice, counsel, or training within an agency or between an agency and the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
              <P>(b) Where the parties are in agreement that the appearance of witnesses or the production of documents is necessary, and such witnesses agree to appear, no such subpoena need be sought.</P>
              <P>(c) A request for a subpoena by any person, as defined in 22 U.S.C. 4102 shall be in writing and filed with the Regional Director, in proceedings arising under parts 1422 and 1423 of this subchapter, or filed with the Board, in proceedings arising under parts 1424 and 1425 of this subchapter, not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the opening of a hearing, or with the appropriate presiding official(s) during the hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) All requests shall name and identify the witnesses or documents sought, and state the reasons therefor. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall grant the request upon the determination that the testimony or documents appear to be necessary to the matters under investigation and the request describes with sufficient particularity the documents sought. Service of an approved subpoena is the responsibility of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued. The subpoena shall show on its face the name and address of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued.</P>

              <P>(e) Any person served with a subpoena who does not intend to comply, shall, within five (5) days after the date of service of the subpoena upon such person, petition in writing to revoke the subpoena. A copy of any petition to revoke a subpoena shall be served on the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued. Such petition to revoke, if made prior to the hearing, and a written statement of service, shall be filed with the Regional Director, who may <PRTPAGE P="452"/>refer the petition to the Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, for ruling. A petition to revoke a subpoena filed during the hearing, and a written statement of service, shall be filed with the appropriate presiding official(s). The Regional Director, or the appropriate presiding official(s) will, as a matter of course, cause a copy of the petition to revoke to be served on the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, but shall not be deemed to assume responsibility for such service. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall revoke the subpoena if the evidence the production of which is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings, or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence the production of which is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is invalid. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall make a simple statement of procedural or other ground for the ruling on the petition to revoke. The petition to revoke, any answer thereto, and any ruling thereon shall not become part of the official record except upon the request of the party aggrieved by the ruling.</P>
              <P>(f) Upon the failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued, upon the request of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, the General Counsel shall, on behalf of such party, institute proceedings in the appropriate district court for the enforcement thereof, unless, in the judgment of the General Counsel, the enforcement of such subpoena would be inconsistent with law and the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The General Counsel shall not be deemed thereby to have assumed responsibility for the effective prosecution of the same before the court thereafter.</P>

              <P>(a) A request for a stay shall be entertained only in conjunction with and as a part of an exception to an action taken by the Grievance Board under part 1425 of this subchapter. The filing of an exception shall not itself operate as a stay of the action involved in the proceedings.</P>
              <P>(b) A timely request for a stay of an action taken by the Grievance Board to which an exception has been filed shall operate as a temporary stay of the award.

              <P>(c) A request for a stay of an action taken by the Grievance Board will be granted only where it appears, based upon the facts and circumstances presented, that:</P>

              <P>(2) A careful balancing of all the equities, including the public interest, warrants issuance of a stay.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Chapter XIV—Memorandum Describing the Authority and Assigned Responsibilities of the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority Under the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute</HD>
            <P>The statutory authority and responsibility of the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Board are stated in section 4108 subsections (1), (2) and (3), of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute as follows:</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 4108 Functions of the General Counsel</HD>
            <P>The General Counsel may—</P>
            <P>(A) investigate alleged unfair labor practices under this chapter,</P>
            <P>(B) file and prosecute complaints under this chapter, and</P>
            <P>(C) exercise such other powers of the Board as the Board may prescribe.</P>
            <P>This memorandum is intended to describe the statutory authority and set forth the prescribed duties and authority of the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority under the Foreign Service Statute, effective February 15, 1981.</P>
            <P>I. <E T="03">Case handling—</E> A. <E T="03">Unfair labor practice cases.</E> The General Counsel has full and final authority and responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to accept and investigate charges filed, to enter into and approve the informal settlement of charges, to approve withdrawal requests, to dismiss charges, to determine matters concerning the consolidation and severance of cases before complaint issues, to issue complaints and notices of hearing, to appear before Administrative Law Judges in hearings on complaints and prosecute as provided in the Board's and the General Counsel's rules and regulations, and to initiate and prosecute injunction proceedings as provided for in section 4109(d) of the Foreign Service Statute. After issuance of the Administrative Law Judge's decision, the General Counsel may file exceptions and briefs and appear before the Board in oral argument, subject to the Board's and the General Counsel's rules and regulations.</P>
            <P>B. <E T="03">Compliance actions (injunction proceedings).</E> The General Counsel is authorized and responsible, on behalf of the Board, to seek and effect compliance with the Board's orders and make such compliance reports to the Board as it may from time to time require.
            </P>

            <FP>On behalf of the Board, the General Counsel will, in full accordance with the directions of the Board, initiate and prosecute injunction proceedings as provided in section 4109(d) of the Foreign Service Statute: <E T="03">Provided however,</E> That the General Counsel will initiate <PRTPAGE P="461"/>and conduct injunction proceedings under section 4109(d) of the Foreign Service Statute only upon approval of the Board.</FP>
            <P>C. <E T="03">Representation cases.</E> The General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to receive and process, in accordance with the decisions of the Board and with such instructions and rules and regulations as may be issued by the Board from time to time, all petitions filed pursuant to sections 4111 and 4118(c) of the Foreign Service Statute. The General Counsel is also authorized and has responsibility to supervise or conduct elections pursuant to section 4111 of the Foreign Service Statute and to enter into consent election agreements in accordance with section 4111(g) of the Foreign Service Statute.
            </P>
            <FP>The authority and responsibility of the General Counsel in representation cases shall extend, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board and the General Counsel, to all phases of the investigation through the conclusion of the hearing (if a hearing should be necessary to resolve disputed issues), but all matters involving decisional action after such hearings are reserved by the Board to itself. In the event a direction of election should issue by the Board, the authority and responsibility of the General Counsel, as herein prescribed, shall attach to the conduct of the ordered election, the initial determination of the validity of challenges and objections to the conduct of the election and other similar matters, except that if appeals shall be taken from the General Counsel's action on the validity of challenges and objections, such appeals will be directed to and decided by the Board in accordance with its procedural requirements. If challenged ballots would not affect the election results and if no objections are filed within five days after the conduct of the Board-directed election under the provisions of section 4111 of the Foreign Service Statute, the General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to certify to the parties the results of the election in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board and the General Counsel.</FP>
            
            <FP>Appeals from the refusal of the General Counsel to issue a notice of hearing, from the conclusions contained in a report and findings issued by the General Counsel, or from the dismissal by the General Counsel of any petition, will be directed to and decided by the Board, in accordance with its procedural requirements.</FP>
            
            <FP>In processing election petitions filed pursuant to section 4111 of the Foreign Service Statute and petitions filed pursuant to section 4118(c) of the Foreign Service Statute, the General Counsel is authorized to conduct an appropriate investigation as to the authenticity of the prescribed showing of interest and, upon making a determination to proceed, where appropriate, to supervise or conduct a secret ballot election or certify the validity of a petition for determination of eligibility for dues allotment. After an election, if there are no challenges or objections which require a hearing by the Board, the General Counsel shall certify the results thereof, with appropriate copies lodged in the Washington, DC, files of the Board.</FP>
            <P>II. <E T="03">Liaison with other governmental agencies.</E> The General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to maintain appropriate and adequate liaison and arrangements with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations with reference to the financial and other reports required to be filed with the Assistant Secretary pursuant to section 4117 of the Foreign Service Statute and the availability to the Board and the General Counsel of the contents thereof. The General Counsel is authorized and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to maintain appropriate and adequate liaison with the Foreign Service Grievance Board with respect to functions which may be performed by the Foreign Service Grievance Board.</P>
            <P>III. To the extent that the above-described duties, powers and authority rest by statute with the Board, the foregoing statement constitutes a prescription and assignment of such duties, powers and authority, whether or not so specified.</P>

          <P>(c) Immediately following the public announcement, the Foundation shall publish the announcement in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(d) The <E T="03">earliest practicable time,</E> as used in this subsection, means as soon as possible, which should not be later than the commencement of the meeting or portion in question.</P>

          <P>(a) Action to close a meeting or a portion thereof, pursuant to the exemptions set forth in § 1500.5, shall be taken only when:</P>

          <P>(1) A majority of the membership of the Foundation's Board of Directors votes to take such action. That vote shall determine whether or not any portion or portions of a meeting or portions of a series of meetings may be <PRTPAGE P="467"/>closed to public, obervation for any of the reasons provided in § 1500.5 and whether or not the public interest nevertheless requires that portion of the meeting or meetings remain open. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Board member participating in such vote shall be recorded, and no proxies shall be allowed.</P>
          <P>(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Foundation close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in § 1500.5 (a) (5), (6), or (7), the Foundation, upon request of any one of its Board members, shall take a recorded vote whether to close such portion of the meeting.</P>
          <P>(b) Within one day of any vote taken, the Foundation shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote, reflecting the vote of each member on the question, and a full written explanation of the action to close a portion of or the entire meeting, together with a list of persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliations.</P>

A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting and the persons present, shall be retained by the Foundation.</P>

          <P>The time or place of a Board meeting may be changed following the public announcement only if the Foundation publicly announces such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Foundation to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement only if a majority of the Board of Directors determines by a recorded vote that Foundation business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible, and the Foundation publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon change at the earliest practicable time.</P>

            <P>(c) The Board is also required to establish an Advisory Council made up of individuals knowledgeable about development activities in Africa, and to consult with the Council at least once each year. The Council shall have not more than 25 members appointed for a period of two years with an option to be reappointed for an additional year.</P>
            <P>(d) The Board of Directors and the aforementioned officers, together with the other employees of the Foundation, constitute the central organization of ADF, and are located and function at ADF headquarters, 1724 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036. It is anticipated that in the future a field organization will be established with offices in selected cities in Africa, but this has not yet occurred.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">When charged.</E> Fees shall be charged in accordance with the schedules contained in paragraph (c) of this section for services rendered in responding to requests for Foundation records under this subpart. Requestors may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. Fees shall also not be charged where they would amount, in the aggregate, for a request or series of related requests, to $25 or less.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Services charged for and amount charged.</E> For the services listed below expended in locating or making available records or copies thereof, the following charges shall be assessed:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Copies.</E> For copies, $.10 per copy of each page.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Clerical searches.</E> For each one quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in excess of the first quarter hour in searching for and producing requested records, $4.75.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-routine, non-clerical searches.</E> Where the task of determining which records fall within a request and collecting them requires the time of professional or managerial personnel, and where the time required is substantial, for each one quarter hour spent in excess of the first quarter hour, $10.00. No charge shall be made for the time spent in resolving legal or policy issues affecting access to records of known contents.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> When a response to a request requires services or materials other than those described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, the direct cost of such services to the Foundation may be charged, providing the requestor has been given an estimate of such cost before it is incurred.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Processing of requests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Processing.</E> A person who has made a written request for records which meets the requirements of § 1502.4 shall be informed by the Chief FOIA Officer within 20 working days after receipt of the request of the Foundation's decision whether to deny or grant access to the records and the right of the requestor to seek assistance from the Foundation's Chief Public Liaison.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Denials.</E> If the Chief FOIA Officer, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, denies a request for records, the requestor will be informed of the name and title of the official responsible for the denial, the reasons for it, and the right to appeal the decision to the President of the Foundation within 90 calendar days of receipt of the denial. The President shall determine any appeal within 20 days of receipt and notify the requestor within the time period of the decision. If the decision is to uphold the denial, the requestor will be informed of the reasons for the decision, of the right to a judicial review of the decision in the federal courts, and of the dispute resolution services offered by the FOIA Public Liaison of the Foundation or the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Extension of time.</E> In unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of requests, the time required to respond to a FOIA request or an appeal may be extended for an additional 10 working days upon written notification to the requestor providing the reasons for the extension. If the extension goes beyond 10 working days, USADF will notify the requestor of services provided by the FOIA Public Liaison and the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> USADF shall process requests and appeals on an expedited basis where the requestor demonstrates a compelling need for the records, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(v). USADF shall make a determination of whether to provide expedited processing, and shall notify the requestor of the determination, within 10 calendar days after the receipt of the request. USADF shall provide expeditious consideration of administrative appeals of determinations of whether to provide expedited processing.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information.</E> Whenever records containing confidential commercial information are requested under the FOIA and USADF determines that it may be required to disclose the records, USADF shall promptly provide written notice to the submitter of the confidential commercial information, in conformity with the procedures set forth in Executive Order 12600, Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235.</P>

            <P>(a) The Agency will undertake prompt action to collect all debts owed to the United States arising out of USADF activities and to reduce debt delinquencies. A collection action may include sending a written notice in the form of a Bill for Collection or demand letter to the debtor's last known address. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), a written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, including the immediate referral to DOJ for litigation or collection by salary offset. The CFO may contact the debtor by telephone, in person and/or in writing to demand prompt payment, to discuss the debtor's position regarding the existence, amount or repayment of the debt, to inform the debtor of its rights (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> to apply for a waiver of indebtedness or to request an administrative review) and of the basis for the debt and the consequences of nonpayment or delay in payment.</P>
            <P>(b) The CFO will maintain an administrative file for each claim. The administrative file will document the basis for the debt, all administrative collection actions regarding the debt (including communications to and from the debtor) and the final disposition of the debt. Information on an individual debtor may be disclosed only for purposes consistent with this Part, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other applicable law.</P>

            <P>(8) The intention of USADF to enforce collection if the debtor fails to pay or otherwise resolve the debt, by taking one or more of the following actions:</P>
            <P>(i) Offset from Federal payments otherwise due to the debtor, including income tax refunds, salary, certain benefit payments, retirement, vendor payments, travel reimbursement and advances, and other Federal payments;</P>
            <P>(ii) Referral to a private collection agency;</P>

            <P>(vii) Other actions authorized by the FCCS and applicable law.</P>

            <P>(9) Any rights available to the debtor to dispute the validity of the debt or to have recovery of the debt waived (citing the available review or waiver authority, the conditions for review or waiver, and the effects of the review or <PRTPAGE P="477"/>waiver request on the collection of the debt);</P>

            <P>(a) USADF shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an internal review of the existence or amount of the debt. For offset of current Federal salary under 5 U.S.C. 5514, a debtor may also request a hearing. (See subpart C of this part).</P>
            <P>(b) A request for a review must be submitted in writing to the appropriate contact office by the payment due date indicated in the Bill for Collection or demand letter.

            <P>(1) USADF will provide for an internal review of the debt by an appropriate official. The review may include examination of documents, internal discussions with relevant officials and discussions with the debtor, at USADF's discretion.</P>
            <P>(2) An oral hearing is not required when USADF determines that the matter can be decided on the documentary record. When an oral hearing is not required, USADF shall accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.</P>
            <P>(3) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although USADF will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Interest.</E> USADF will assess interest on all delinquent debts, unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.</P>
            <P>(1) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the payment due date established in the initial notice to the debtor, or as otherwise provided by law. USADF shall charge an annual rate of interest that is equal to the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 unless a different rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. USADF will notify the debtor of the basis for its finding that a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Government.</P>
            <P>(2) The rate of interest, as initially assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement, interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect on the date a new agreement is executed.</P>

            <P>(3) Interest will not be assessed on interest charges, administrative costs or late payment penalties. However, where a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement and interest, administrative costs and penalty charges that had been waived under the defaulted agreement may be reinstated and added to the debt principal under <PRTPAGE P="478"/>any new agreement and interest may be charged on the entire amount of the debt.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative costs of collecting overdue debts.</E> The costs of USADF's administrative processing of overdue debts, including charges assessed by the Department of Treasury in cross-servicing the debts based on either actual or average cost incurred, will be charged on all debts. These costs include both direct and indirect costs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Penalties.</E> Penalty charges will be assessed at 6 percent a year on any portion of a claim that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Allocation of payments.</E> A partial payment by a debtor will be applied first towards outstanding administrative costs, penalty assessments, accrued interest and then towards the outstanding debt principal.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Waivers.</E> (1) USADF will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on any portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment charges begin to accrue. This 30 day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis where the Agency determines that such action is in the best interest of the Government.</P>
            <P>(2) USADF may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty or administrative costs, where it determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) Waiver is justified under the criteria of subpart D; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the United States.</P>

BFS may take any of the following collection actions on behalf of USADF:</P>

            <P>(b) BFS will maintain records on debt transferred to it, assure that accounts are updated as necessary, and modify its delinquent debt and debtor records with information obtained from its skip tracking and asset-location services as appropriate. In the event that a referred debtor disputes the validity of a debt or any terms and conditions related to any debt not reduced by judgment, BFS may return the disputed debt to USADF for its determination of debt validity.</P>

The authority to waive the application of this section may be delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and re-delegated. USADF may also suspend or revoke other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure of a debtor to pay a claim. Additionally, the Agency may suspend or disqualify any contractor, lender, broker, borrower, grantee or other debtor from doing business with USADF or engaging in programs USADF sponsors or funds if a debtor fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time.

If the debtor is financially unable to pay the debt in one lump sum, USADF may accept payment in regular installments. USADF will obtain financial statements from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay on one lump sum and independently verify such representations whenever possible. In addition, USADF will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event of a default.</P>
            <P>(b) The size and frequency of the installment payments will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. To the extent possible, the installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.</P>
            <P>(c) In appropriate cases, the Agency will obtain security for deferred payments. However, USADF may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give security.</P>

An oral hearing will consist of an informal conference before a hearing official in which the employee and the Agency may present evidence, witnesses and arguments. The employee may be represented by an individual of his/her choosing. The Agency shall maintain a summary record of all oral hearings provided under the procedures of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Will the debt be collected in a lump sum or by installment deductions from my pay account?</SUBJECT>
            <P>A debt will be collected in a lump sum or by installment deductions at established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account. If the employee is financially unable to pay a debt in a lump sum or the amount of debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay, collection will be made in installments, unless the employee and the Agency agree to alternative arrangements for payment. Alternative payment schedules must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the CFO and will be documented in the Agency's files.</P>

            <P>Installment deduction will be made over the period of active duty or employment. The size and frequency of the installment deductions generally will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, an amount deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payments should be in amounts sufficient to liquidate the debt within a period of three years or less. Installment payments of less than $50 will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</P>

            <P>(b) If an employee files a timely request for hearing, deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a final written decision indicating the amount owed to the Government.

            <P>USADF will assess interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts collected under the procedures in this section. Interest, penalty and administrative costs will continue to accrue during the period that the debtor is seeking formal or informal review of the debt or requesting a waiver. The following guidelines apply to the assessment of these costs on debts collected by salary offset:</P>
            <P>(a) Interest will be assessed on all debts not collected by the payment due date specified in the Bill for Collection or demand letter. USADF will waive the interest and administrative charges on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue.</P>
            <P>(b) Administrative costs will be assessed if the debt is referred to Treasury for cross-servicing.</P>
            <P>(c) Deductions by administrative offset normally begin prior to the time for assessment of a penalty. Therefore, a penalty charge will not be assessed unless deductions occur more than 90 days from the due date in the Bill for Collection or demand letter.</P>

            <P>(a) USADF will use salary offset means of collecting debt against one of its employees that is indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency. The requesting agency must certify that the USADF employee owes a debt and that the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met.

USADF will not review the merits of the creditor agency's determinations with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim form. USADF will not assess a handling or any other related charge to cover the cost of its processing the claim.</P>
            <P>(d) Employees separating from USADF before a debt to another agency is collected—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Employees separating from Government service.</E> If an employee begins separation action before USADF collects the total debt due the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:</P>
            <P>(i) To the extent possible, the balance owed the creditor agency will be liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee from USADF;</P>
            <P>(ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, USADF will certify to the creditor agency and the employee the total amount of USADF's collection; and</P>
            <P>(iii) If USADF is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it will provide such information to the creditor agency so that it can file a certified claim against the payments.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Employees who transfer to another Federal agency.</E> If an USADF employee transfers to another Federal agency before USADF collects the total amount due the creditor agency, USADF will certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. It is the responsibility of the creditor agency to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new employing agency.</P>

            <P>The amount accepted in compromise in such cases will reflect the costs of collection, the probability of prevailing on the legal issues involved, and the likely amount of court costs and attorney's fees in litigation.</P>
            <P>(c) To assess the merits of a compromise offer, USADF generally will require a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income and expenses.</P>

            <P>(2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or</P>
            <P>(3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.</P>
            <P>(b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, USADF may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review, and:</P>
            <P>(1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or</P>
            <P>(2) Future collection can be effected by offset; or</P>
            <P>(3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date.</P>
            <P>(c) USADF will suspend collection activity during the time required for waiver consideration or administrative review prior to agency collection of a debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits the Agency from collecting the debt during that time. USADF will ordinarily suspend collection action during the pendency of its consideration of a waiver request or administrative review where statute and regulation preclude refund of amounts collected by the Agency should the debtor prevail.</P>
            <P>(d) USADF may suspend collection activities on debts of $100,000 or less during the pendency of a permissive waiver or administrative review when there is no statutory requirement and where it determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted and the debtor may be found not owing the debt (in whole or in part);</P>
            <P>(2) The Government's interest is protected, if suspension is granted, by the reasonable assurance that the debt can be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; or</P>
            <P>(3) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship to the debtor.</P>

          <SUBJECT>General policies.</SUBJECT>
          <P>It is the policy of the Foundation to safeguard the right of privacy of any individual as to whom the Foundation maintains personal information in any records system, and to provide such individuals with appropriate and complete access to such records, including adequate opportunity to correct any errors in said records. It is further the policy of the Foundation to maintain its records in such a fashion that the information contained therein is, and remains, material and relevant to the purposes for which it is collected. Information in such records will be collected, maintained, used or disseminated in a manner that assures that such action is for a necessary and lawful purpose, and that adequate safeguards are provided to prevent misuse of such information. Exemptions from records requirements provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a will be permitted only where an important public policy need for such exemptions has been determined pursuant to specific statutory authority.</P>

          <P>The Foundation will not disclose any record contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person or any other agency except by written request or prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains or his or her agent or attorney, unless such disclosure is:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Accounting for disclosure of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) With respect to each system of records under ADF control, the Foundation will keep an accurate accounting of routine disclosures, except those made to employees of the Foundation in the normal course of duties or pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Such accounting shall contain the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made:</P>
          <P>(2) Sufficient information to permit the construction of a listing of all disclosures at appropriate periodic intervals; and</P>
          <P>(3) The justification or basis upon which any release was made including any written documentation required.</P>
          <P>(b) The Foundation will retain the accounting made under this section for at least 5 years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.</P>

          <P>(c) Except for disclosure made under paragraph (g) of § 1503.3, the Foundation will make the accounting under paragraph (a) of this section available <PRTPAGE P="488"/>to the individual named in the record at his or her request.</P>
          <P>(d) The Foundation will inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1507.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Access to records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided by law or regulation, any individual, upon request made either in writing or in person during regular business hours, shall be provided access to his or her record or to any information pertaining to him or her which is contained in a system of records maintained by the Foundation. The individual will be permitted to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him or her. Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a, however, allows an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
          <P>(b) An individual will be notified, upon request, if any Foundation system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her. Such request may be made in person during regular business hours, or in writing over the signature of the person making the request. Individuals requesting the information will be required to identify themselves by providing their names, addresses, and a signature. If they are requesting disclosure in person, they are also required to show an identification card, such as a drivers license, containing a photo and a sample signature. If the request is received through the mail, the Foundation may request such information as may be necessary to assure that the requesting individual is properly identified. This may include a requirement that the request be notarized with a notation that the notary received an acknowledgement of identity from the requester.</P>
          <P>(c) A record may be disclosed to a representative of the person to whom a record relates when the representative is authorized in writing by such person to have access.</P>
          <P>(d) Requests for access to or copies of records should contain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate any given record, and a brief description of the item or items of information required. If the individual wishes access to specific documents, the request should identify or describe, as nearly as possible, such documents. The request should be made to the Director, Administration and Finance, African Development Foundation, 1625 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Suite 600, Washington, DC 20036. Personal contacts should normally be made during the regular duty hours of the officer concerned, which are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.</P>
          <P>(e) A request made in person will be promptly complied with if the records sought are in the immediate custody of the Foundation. Mail or personal requests for documents which are not in the immediate custody of ADF or which are otherwise not immediately available, will be acknowledged within ten working days of receipt, and the records will be provided as promptly thereafter as possible.</P>
          <P>(f) Special procedures may be established by the President of the Foundation governing the disclosure to an individual of his or her medical records, including psychological records.</P>
          <P>(g) Any individual may request the Director, Administration and Finance, to amend any Foundation record pertaining to him or her. Not later than 10 working days after the date of receipt of such request, the Director, Administration and Finance, or his/her designee, will acknowledge such receipt in writing. Promptly after acknowledging receipt of a request, the Director, Administration and Finance or his/her designee will:</P>
          <P>(1) Correct any portion of the record which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete; or</P>
          <P>(2) Inform the individual of the Foundation's refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request, the reason for the refusal, the procedures by which the individual may request a review of that refusal by the President of the Foundation, or his/her designee, and the name and address of such official; or</P>

          <P>(3) Refer the request to the agency that has control of and maintains the record when the record requested is not <PRTPAGE P="489"/>the property of the Foundation, but of the controlling agency.</P>
          <P>(h) Any individual who disagrees with the refusal of the Director, Administration and Finance to amend his or her record may request a review of that refusal. Such request for review must be made within 30 days after receipt by the requester of the initial refusal to amend. The President of the Foundation, or designee, will complete such review not later than 30 working days from the date on which the individual requests such review, and make a final determination, unless for good cause shown, the President or designee extends such 30-day period and notifies the requester in writing that additional time is required to complete the review. If, after review, the President or designee refuses to amend the record in accordance with the request, the individual will be advised of the right to file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal, and also advised of the provisions in the Act for judicial review of the President's determination.</P>
          <P>(i) In any disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement under paragraph (g) of this section, the Foundation will clearly note any part of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement and, if the Foundation deems it appropriate, copies of a concise statement of the Foundation's reasons for not making the amendment requested, to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record has been disclosed.</P>

          <P>(c) The Foundation will inform each individual whom it asks to supply information on any form which it uses to collect the information, or on a separate form that can be retained by the individual, of:</P>
          <P>(1) The authority which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether provision of such information is mandatory or voluntary;</P>
          <P>(2) The purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;</P>
          <P>(3) The routine uses which may be made of the information, as published pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>

          <P>(7) The Foundation's procedures whereby an individual can be notified at his or her request if the system or systems of records contains a record pertaining to him or her;</P>
          <P>(8) The Foundation's procedures whereby an individual can be notified at him or her request how he or she can gain access to any record pertaining to him or her contained in the system or systems of records, and how he or she can contest its content; and</P>

          <P>(9) The categories of sources of records in the system or systems.<PRTPAGE P="490"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) All records used by the Foundation in making any determination about any individual will be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.</P>
          <P>(f) Before disseminating any record about an individual to any person other than an agency or pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552, the Foundation will make reasonable efforts to assure that such records are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for Foundation purposes.</P>
          <P>(g) The Foundation will maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or unless pertinent to, and within the scope of, an authorized law enforcement activity.</P>
          <P>(h) The Foundation will establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of any system of records, or in maintaining any record. Each such person will be instructed regarding such rules and the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a. The instruction will include any other rules and procedures adopted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the penalties provided for noncompliance.</P>
          <P>(i) The Foundation will establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Exclusion or excluded,</E> which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Disqualification or disqualified,</E> which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does this part do?</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension for ADF nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).</P>

            <P>(a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.</P>
            <P>(b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible.</P>
            <P>(c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.</P>

            <P>(a) Be a participant in a(n) ADF transaction that is a covered transaction under subpart B of this part;</P>
            <P>(b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for debarment and suspension; or</P>

If the ADF President grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.</P>

            <P>If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.</P>

            <P>If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part.

            <P>(1) ADF transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;</P>
            <P>(2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or</P>
            <P>(3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.</P>

            <P>(c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless—</P>
            <P>(1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 1508.310 or § 1508.415; or</P>
            <P>(2) A(n) ADF official obtains an exception from the ADF President to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 1508.120.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:</P>
            <P>(a) A direct award to—</P>
            <P>(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;</P>
            <P>(2) A public international organization;</P>
            <P>(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or</P>
            <P>(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.</P>

            <P>(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> those benefits are not covered <PRTPAGE P="497"/>transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.</P>
            <P>(c) Federal employment.</P>
            <P>(d) A transaction that the African Development Foundation needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.</P>
            <P>(e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the African Development Foundation specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.</P>
            <P>(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.</P>

            <P>(a) Covered transactions under this part—</P>
            <P>(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but</P>
            <P>(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).</P>
            <P>(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:</P>
            <P>(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 1508.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.</P>
            <P>(2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) ADF official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.</P>
            <P>(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When may the suspending official issue a suspension?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that—</P>
            <P>(a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 1508.800(a), or</P>
            <P>(b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 1508.800(b) through (d); and</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1508.705</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.</P>
            <P>(b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.</P>
            <P>(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.</P>

            <P>(3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's decision whether to continue the suspension; or</P>
            <P>(4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.</P>

            <P>(a) The debarring official may debar you for any of the causes in § 1508.800. However, the official need not debar you even if a cause for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at § 1508.860.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?</SUBJECT>
            <P>This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</P>
            <P>(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.</P>
            <P>(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.</P>
            <P>(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.</P>
            <P>(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.</P>
            <P>(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.</P>
            <P>(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.</P>
            <P>(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.</P>
            <P>(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.</P>
            <P>(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.</P>
            <P>(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.</P>
            <P>(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.</P>

            <P>(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the <PRTPAGE P="510"/>individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.</P>
            <P>(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.</P>
            <P>(s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How long may my debarment last?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 1508.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.</P>
            <P>(c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.</P>

            <P>(a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.</P>
            <P>(b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 1508.615 that the official decided, either—</P>
            <P>(1) Not to debar you; or</P>
            <P>(2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:</P>
            <P>(i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;</P>
            <P>(ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;</P>
            <P>(iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective dates; and</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1510.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for <PRTPAGE P="524"/>reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1510.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1510.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1510.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          </P>
          <P>(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity.</P>
          <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1600.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1600.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements <PRTPAGE P="533"/>to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1600.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1600.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>

          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons <PRTPAGE P="534"/>with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1600.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>The purpose of this part is to implement the spirit of section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by various Executive agencies. Although the USIP does not believe that Congress contemplated coverage of independent Federal institutions, such as the USIP, it has chosen to promulgate this part.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1701.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

        <SECTION>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1701.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing <PRTPAGE P="543"/>facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1701.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1701.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall <PRTPAGE P="544"/>give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1701.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
