      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Depositions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application to take.</E> (1) An application to take a deposition must be in writing setting forth the reason why the deposition should be taken, the name and address of the witness, the matters concerning which it is expected the witness will testify, and the time and place proposed for the taking of the deposition, together with the name and address of the person before whom it is desired that the deposition be taken. If the deposition is being offered in connection with a hearing or examination, the application for deposition must be made to the Commission at least 15 days prior to the proposed date of such hearing or examination.</P>
              <P>(2) Application to take a deposition may be made during a hearing or examination, or subsequent to a hearing or examination, only where it is shown for good cause that the facts as set forth in the application to take the deposition were not within the knowledge of the person signing the application prior to the time of the hearing or examination.</P>
              <P>(3) The Commission or its representative will, upon receipt of the application and a showing of good cause, make and cause to be served upon the parties an order which will specify the name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken, the time, the place, and where practicable the designation of the officer before whom the witness is to testify. The officer may or may not be the one specified in the application. The order will be served upon all parties at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of the deposition.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Who may take.</E> The deposition may be taken before the designated officer or, if none is designated, before any officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States. If the examination is held in a foreign country, it may be taken before a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul-general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Examination and certification of testimony.</E> At the time and place specified in the Commission's order, the officer taking the deposition will permit the witness to be examined and cross-examined under oath by all parties appearing, and the testimony will be reduced to writing by, or under the direction of, the presiding officer. All objections to questions or evidence will be deemed waived unless made in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The officer will not have power to rule upon any objections but will note them upon the deposition. The testimony must be subscribed by the witness in the presence of the officer who will attach a certificate stating that the witness was duly sworn, that the deposition is a true record of the testimony and exhibits given by the witness and that the officer is not counsel or attorney to any of the interested parties. The officer will immediately seal and deliver an original and two copies of the transcript, together with the officer's certificate, by registered mail to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, Washington, DC 20579 or, if applicable, to the designated Commission field office.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Admissibility in evidence.</E> The deposition will be admissible in evidence, subject to such objections to the questions and answers as were noted at the time of taking the deposition, or within ten (10) days after the return thereof, and would be valid were the witness personally present at the hearing.<PRTPAGE P="11"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Errors and irregularities.</E> All errors or irregularities occurring will be deemed waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after the defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Scope of use.</E> The deposition of a witness, if relevant, may be used if the Commission finds:</P>
              <P>(1) That the witness has died since the deposition was taken; or</P>
              <P>(2) That the witness is at a distance greater than 100 miles radius of Washington, DC, the designated field office or the designated place of the hearing; or</P>
              <P>(3) That the witness is unable to attend because of other good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Interrogatories and cross-interrogatories.</E> Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by oral examination. When a deposition is taken upon interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the parties may be present or represented, and no person, other than the witness, the person's representative or attorney, a stenographic reporter and the presiding officer, may be present at the examination of the witness, which fact will be certified by the officer, who will read the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the testimony to writing in the witness's own words.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Fees.</E> A witness whose deposition is taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, and the officer taking the deposition, will be entitled to the same fees and mileage allowed and paid for like service in the United States District Court for the district in which the deposition is taken. Such fees will be paid by the Commission or by the party at whose request the deposition is being taken.</P>

The Commission was transferred to the Department of Justice as an independent agency within that department as of October 1, 1980, under the terms of Public Law 96-209, approved March 14, 1980 (94 Stat. 96, 22 U.S.C. 1622a). Its duties and authority are defined in the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, as amended (64 Stat. 12, 22 U.S.C. 1621-1645o) and the War Claims Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 1240, 50 U.S.C. App. 2001-2017p).</P>
              <P>(b) The Commission has jurisdiction to determine the validity and amount of claims of United States nationals against foreign governments for compensation for losses and injuries sustained by those nationals, pursuant to programs authorized under either of the cited Acts. Funds for payment of claims are derived from international settlement agreements or through liquidation of foreign assets in the United States by the Department of Justice or Treasury, or from public funds when provided by the Congress.</P>
              <P>(c) The Chair and the two part-time members of the Commission are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate to serve for 3-year terms of office as provided in 22 U.S.C. 1622c(c).</P>
              <P>(d) All functions of the Commission are vested in the Chair with respect to the internal management of the affairs of the Commission, including but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) The appointment of Commission employees;</P>

              <P>(4) The preparation of budget estimates; and</P>
              <P>(5) The use and expenditures of Commission funds appropriated for expenses of administration.</P>
              <P>(e) Requests for records must be made in writing by mail or presented in person to the Administrative Officer, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, Washington, DC 20579.</P>
              <P>(f) The offices of the Commission are located at 600 E Street NW (Bicentennial Building), Room 6002, Washington, DC.</P>

              <P>(a) Each person desiring access to a record covered by this part must comply with the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) A written request must be made for the record.</P>
              <P>(2) Such request must indicate that it is being made under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
              <P>(3) The envelope in which the request is sent must be prominently marked with the letters “FOIA.”</P>
              <P>(4) The request must be addressed to the appropriate official or employee of the Commission as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The foregoing requirements must be complied with whether the request is mailed or hand-delivered to the Commission.</P>

              <P>(b) If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are not met, the twenty-day time limit described in § 502.10(a) will not begin to run until the request has been identified by an <PRTPAGE P="14"/>official or employee of the Commission as a request under the Freedom of Information Act and has been received by the appropriate official or employee of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) Each person desiring access to a record covered in this part that is located in the Commission, or to obtain a copy of such a record, must make a written request to the Administrative Officer, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, 600 E Street NW, Room 6002, Washington, DC 20579.</P>
              <P>(d) Each request should reasonably describe the particular record requested. The request should specify the subject matter, the date when it was made and the person or office that made it. If the description is insufficient, the official or employee handling the request may notify the person making the request and, to the extent possible, indicate the additional data required.</P>
              <P>(e) Each record made available under this section is available for inspection and copying during regular working hours. Original documents may be copied but may not be released from custody.</P>
              <P>(f) Authority to administer this part in connection with Commission records is delegated to the Administrative Officer or the Commission employee acting in that official's capacity.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 502.11</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Actions on requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrative Officer or any employee acting in that official's capacity will determine within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of any a request whether to comply with the request. Upon receipt of a request for a Commission record which is available, the Administrative Officer or other employee will notify the requester as to the time the record is available, and will promptly make the record available after advising the requester of the applicable fees under § 502.13. The person making the request will be notified immediately after any adverse determination, the reasons for making the adverse determination and the right of the person to appeal.</P>
              <P>(b) Any denial of a request for a record will be written and signed by the Administrative Officer or other employee, including a statement of the reason for denial. That statement will contain, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) A reference to the specific exemption under the Freedom of Information Act authorizing the withholding of a record, and to the extent consistent with the purpose of the exemption, an explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.</P>

              <P>(c) In unusual circumstances, the time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section may be extended by written notice to the person making the request setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No extension notice will specify a date that would result in an extension for more than twenty working days. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request—</P>
              <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
              <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
              <P>(3) The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Any person to whom a record has not been made available within the time limits established by paragraph (b) of § 502.11, and any person who has been given an adverse determination pursuant to paragraph (b) of § 503.10 of this chapter, that a requested record will not be disclosed, may apply to the Office of Information and Privacy, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, <PRTPAGE P="15"/>DC 20530, for reconsideration of the request. The person making such a request will also be notified of the provisions for judicial review provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(b) Each application for reconsideration must be made in writing within sixty days from the date of receipt of the original denial and must include all information and arguments relied upon by the person making the request. The application must indicate that it is an appeal from a denial of a request made under the Freedom of Information Act. The envelope in which the application is sent must be prominently marked with the letters “FOIA.” If these requirements are not met, the twenty day limit described in § 502.10 will not begin to run until the application has been identified as an application under the Freedom of Information Act and has been received by the Office of Information and Privacy of the Department of Justice.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever it is to be determined necessary, the person making the request may be required to furnish additional information, or proof of factual allegations and other proceedings appropriate in the circumstances may be ordered.</P>
              <P>(d) The decision not to disclose a record under this part is considered to be a withholding for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In the event any document or record requested hereunder should contain material which is exempt from disclosure under this section, any reasonably segregable portion of the record will, notwithstanding that fact, and to the extent feasible, be provided to any person requesting it, after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this section. Documents or records determined to be exempt from disclosure hereunder may nonetheless be provided upon request in the event it is determined that the provision of the document would not violate the public interest or the right of any person to whom the information may pertain, and the disclosure is not prohibited by law or Executive Order. The following categories of records are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b):</P>
              <P>(a) Records which are specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order. This exception may apply to records in the custody of the Commission which have been transmitted to the Commission by another agency which has designated the record as nonpublic under Executive Order.</P>
              <P>(b) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.</P>
              <P>(d) Information given in confidence. This includes information obtained by or given to the Commission which constitutes confidential commercial or financial information, privileged information, or other information which was given to the Commission in confidence or would not customarily be released by the person from whom it was obtained.</P>
              <P>(e) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the Commission. Such communications include inter-agency memoranda, drafts, staff memoranda transmitted to the Commission, written communications between the Commission and its staff regarding the preparation of Commission decisions, other documents received or generated in the process of issuing a decision or regulation, and reports and other work papers of staff attorneys, accountants, and investigators.</P>
              <P>(f) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
              <P>(g) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
              <P>(1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>

              <P>(2) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;<PRTPAGE P="16"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
              <P>(4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a state, local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
              <P>(5) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
              <P>(6) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fees for services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following provisions shall apply in the assessment and collection of fees for services rendered in processing requests for disclosure of Commission records under this part.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Fee for duplication of records:</E> $0.15 per page.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Search and review fees:</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Searches for records by clerical personnel—$3.00 per quarter hour, including time spent searching for and copying any record.</P>
              <P>(2) Search for and review of records by professional and supervisory personnel—$6.00 per quarter hour spent searching for any record or reviewing a record to determine whether it may be disclosed, including time spent in copying any record.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification and validation fee:</E> $1.00 for each certification, validation or authentication of a copy of any record.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Imposition of fees:</E>
              </P>

              <P>(1) Commercial use requests—Where a request appears to seek disclosure of records for a commercial use, the requester shall be charged for the time spent by Commission personnel in searching for the requested record and in reviewing the record to determine whether it should be disclosed, and for the cost of each page of duplication. <E T="03">Commercial use</E> is defined as a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. The request also must reasonably identify the records sought.</P>

              <P>(2) Requests from representatives of news media—Where a request seeks disclosure of records to a representative of the news media, the requester shall be charged only for the actual duplication cost of the records and only to the extent that the number of duplications exceeds 100 pages; provided, however, that the request must reasonably describe the records sought, and it must appear that the records are for use by the requester in such person's capacity as a news media representative. “Representative of the news media” refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. A “freelance” journalist not actually employed by a news organization shall be eligible for inclusion under this category if the person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a news organization.</P>

              <P>(3) Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific institutions—Where a request seeks disclosure of records to an educational or non-commercial scientific institution, the requester shall be charged only for the actual duplication cost of the records and only to the extent that the number of duplications exceeds 100 pages; provided, however, that the request must reasonably describe the records sought and it must appear that the records are to be used by the requester in furtherance of its educational or non-commercial scientific research programs. “Educational institution” refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, or an institution of undergraduate, graduate, professional or vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. “Non-commercial scientific institution” refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section <PRTPAGE P="17"/>and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
              <P>(4) All other requests—Where a request seeks disclosure of records to a person or entity other than one coming within paragraphs (d) (1), (2) and (3) of this section, the requester shall be charged the full cost of search and duplication. However, the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication shall be furnished without charge.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Aggregating of requests.</E> If there exists a solid basis for concluding that a requester or group of requesters has submitted a series of partial requests for disclosure of records in an attempt to evade assessment of fees, the requests may be aggregated so as to constitute a single request, with fees charged accordingly.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Unsuccessful searches.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the cost of searching for a requested record shall be charged even if the search fails to locate the record or it is determined that the record is exempt from disclosure.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Interest.</E> In the event a requester fails to remit payment of fees charged for processing a request under this part within 30 days from the date those fees were billed, interest on the fees may be assessed beginning on the 31st day after the billing date, to be calculated at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (1) If, but only if, it is estimated or determined that processing of a request for disclosure of records will result in a charge of fees of more than $250.00, the requester may be required to pay the fees in advance in order to obtain completion of the processing.</P>
              <P>(2) If a requester has previously failed to make timely payment (i.e., within 30 days of billing date) of fees charged under this part, the requester may be required to pay those fees and interest accrued thereon, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of estimated fees chargeable in connection with any pending or new request, in order to obtain processing of the pending or new request.</P>
              <P>(3) With regard to any request coming within paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section, the administrative time limits set forth in §§ 502.11 and 502.12 of this part will begin to run only after the requisite fee payments have been received.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Non-payment.</E> In the event of non-payment of billed charges for disclosure of records, the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer credit reporting agencies and referral to collection agencies, may be utilized to obtain payment.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of charges.</E> Fees otherwise chargeable in connection with a request for disclosure of a record shall be waived or reduced where—</P>
              <P>(1) It is determined that disclosure is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; or</P>
              <P>(2) It is determined that the cost of collection would be equal to or exceed the amount of those fees. No charges shall be assessed if the fees amount to $8.00 or less.</P>

                <P>(a) The closing of a meeting will occur when:</P>
                <P>(1) A majority of the membership of the Commission votes to take that action.

              <SUBJECT>Claim defined.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subchapter is included solely in order to provide for the adjudication of any additional claims that may arise on behalf of survivors of deceased civilians and military veterans who had been listed as missing during the Vietnam conflict but were subsequently determined to have been interned, in hiding, or captured by a hostile force in Southeast Asia (see § 504.2(a)(3) and (b)(3)). The Commission no longer has authority to receive or consider any other types of claims based on the internment of civilians or the maltreatment of military servicemen held as prisoners of war by forces hostile to the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) A properly completed and executed application made on an official form provided by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission for such purpose constitutes a claim and will be processed under the laws administered by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) Any communication, letter, note, or memorandum from a claimant, or the claimant's duly authorized representative, or a person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not legally competent, setting forth sufficient facts to apprise the Commission of an interest to apply under the provisions of sections 5(i) and 6(f) of the Act, will be deemed to be an informal claim. Where an informal claim is received and an official form is forwarded for completion and execution by the applicant, that official form will be considered as evidence necessary to complete the initial claim, and unless that official form is received within thirty (30) days from the date it was transmitted for execution, if the claimant resides in the continental United States, or forty-five (45) days if outside the continental United States, the claim may be disallowed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedure for determination of claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commission may on its own motion order a hearing upon any claim, specifying the questions to which the hearing shall be limited.</P>

              <P>(b) Without previous hearing, the Commission or a designated member of the staff may issue a Proposed Decision in determination of a claim. This Proposed Decision will set forth findings of <PRTPAGE P="34"/>fact and conclusions of law on the relevant elements of the claim, to the extent that evidence and information relevant to such elements is before the Commission. The claimant will have the burden of proof in submitting evidence and information sufficient to establish the elements necessary for a determination of the validity and amount of his or her claim.</P>
              <P>(c) The Proposed Decision will be delivered to the claimant or the claimant's attorney of record in person or by mail. Delivery by mail will be deemed completed 5 days after the mailing of the Proposed Decision addressed to the last known address of the claimant or the claimant's attorney of record. A copy of the Proposed Decision will be available for public inspection at the offices of the Commission, except in cases where public disclosure of the names of claimants is barred by statute.</P>

              <P>(d) It will be the policy of the Commission to post on a bulletin board and on its World Wide Web site (<E T="03">http://www.usdoj.gov/fcsc</E>), any information of general interest to claimants before the Commission.</P>
              <P>(e) When the Proposed Decision denies a claim in whole or in part, the claimant may file notice of objection to the denial within 15 days of delivery of the decision. If the claimant wishes to appear at an oral hearing before the Commission to present his or her objection, the claimant must request the oral hearing at the time of submission of his or her objection, stating the reasons for objection, and may request a hearing on the claim, specifying whether for the taking of evidence or for oral argument on the legal issues which are the subject of the objection.</P>
              <P>(f) Copies of objections to or requests for hearings on Proposed Decisions will be available for public inspection at the Commission's offices.</P>
              <P>(g) Upon the expiration of 30 days after delivery to the claimant or claimant's attorney, if no objection under this section has in the meantime been filed, a staff Proposed Decision, upon approval by the Commission, will become the Commission's final determination and decision on the claim. A Proposed Decision issued by the Commission will become final 30 days after delivery to the claimant or the claimant's attorney without further order or decision by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(h) If an objection has in the meantime been filed, but no hearing requested, the Commission may, after due consideration thereof:</P>
              <P>(1) Issue a Final Decision affirming or modifying its Proposed Decision,</P>
              <P>(2) Issue an Amended Proposed Decision, or</P>
              <P>(3) On its own motion order hearing thereon, indicating whether for the taking of evidence on specified questions or for the hearing of oral arguments.</P>
              <P>(i) After the conclusion of a hearing, upon the expiration of any time allowed by the Commission for further submissions, the Commission may proceed to issue a Final Decision in determination of the claim.</P>
              <P>(j)(1) In case an individual claimant dies prior to the issuance of the Final Decision, that person's legal representative will be substituted as party claimant. However, upon failure of a representative to qualify for substitution, the Commission may issue its decision in the name of the estate of the deceased and, in case of an award, certify the award in the same manner to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment, if the payment of the award is provided for by statute.</P>
              <P>(2) Notice of the Commission's action under this paragraph will be forwarded to the claimant's attorney of record, or if the claimant is not represented by an attorney, the notice will be addressed to the estate of the claimant at the last known place of residence.</P>
              <P>(3) The term <E T="03">legal representative</E> as applied in this paragraph means, in general, the administrator or executor, heir(s), next of kin, or descendant(s).</P>
              <P>(k) After the date of filing with the Commission no claim may be amended to reflect the assignment thereof by the claimant to any other person or entity except as otherwise provided by statute.</P>

              <P>(l) At any time after a final Decision has been issued on a claim, or a Proposed Decision has been entered as the Final Decision on a claim, but not later than 60 days before the completion date of the Commission's affairs in connection with the program under <PRTPAGE P="35"/>which such claim is filed, a petition to reopen on the ground of newly discovered evidence may be filed. No such petition will be entertained unless it appears therein that the newly discovered evidence came to the knowledge of the party filing the petition subsequent to the date of issuance of the Final Decision or the date on which the Proposed Decision was entered as the Final Decision; that it was not for want of due diligence that the evidence did not come sooner to the claimant's knowledge; and that the evidence is material, and not merely cumulative, and that reconsideration of the matter on the basis of that evidence would produce a different decision. The petition must include a statement of the facts which the petitioner expects to prove, the name and address of each witness, the identity of documents, and the reasons for failure to make earlier submission of the evidence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Hearings, whether upon the Commission's own motion or upon request of claimant, will be held upon not less than fifteen days' notice of the time and place thereof.</P>
              <P>(b) The hearings will be open to the public unless otherwise requested by claimant and ordered by the Commission, or when required by law.</P>
              <P>(c) The hearings will be conducted by the Commission, its designee or designees. Oral testimony and documentary evidence, including depositions that may have been taken as provided by statute and the rules of practices, may be offered in evidence on the claimant's behalf or by counsel for the Commission designated by it to represent the public interest opposed to the allowance of any unjust or unfounded claim or portion thereof; and either may cross-examine as to evidence offered through witnesses on behalf of the other. Objections to the admission of any such evidence will be ruled upon by the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(d) The hearings will be conducted as non-adversarial proceedings. However, the claimant will be the moving party, and will have the burden of proof on all issues involved in the determination of his or her claim.</P>
              <P>(e) Hearings may be stenographically reported or electronically recorded, either at the request of the claimant or upon the discretion of the Commission. A claimant making such a request must notify the Commission at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing date. When a stenographic record or transcript of a hearing is ordered at the claimant's request, the cost of the reporting and transcription will be charged to the claimant.</P>
              <P>(f) The following rules of procedure will apply in the conduct of hearings held by the Commission for presentation of objections to Proposed Decisions:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Presentation of objections to Proposed Decisions.</E> (i) Objections should focus either on the presentation of new evidence, or on the presentation of arguments demonstrating that, in the claimant's view, the Commission erred in considering the evidence previously submitted.

            <P>The Security Officer (Information) chairs the Foundation's Classification Review Committee which has authority to act on all suggestions and complaints with respect to the Foundation's administration of the regulations. The Assistant Directors and the Heads of other offices reporting to the Director serve as members of the Committee. All suggestions and complaints including those regarding overclassification, failure to classify, or delay in declassifying not otherwise resolved, shall be referred to the Committee for resolution. The Committee shall establish procedures to review and act within 30 days upon all appeals regarding requests for declassification. The Committee is authorized to overrule previous determinations in whole or in part when in its judgment, continued protection is no longer required. If the Committee determines that continued classification is required under the criteria of the Executive Order, it shall promptly so notify the requester and advise him that he may file an application for review with the Foundation. In addition, the Committee shall review all appeals of requests for records <PRTPAGE P="42"/>under section 552 of title 5 U.S.C. (Freedom of Information Act) when the proposed denial is based on their continued classification under Executive Order 12958.</P>

            <P>Distinct from “original” classification is the determination that information is in substance the same as information currently classified, because of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating or generating in new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material consistent with the marking of the source information. Persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original classification authority.</P>
            <P>(a) If a person who applies derivative classification markings believes that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of classified information has changed the level of or removed the basis for classification, that person must consult for a determination an appropriate official of the originating agency or office of origin who has the authority to upgrade, downgrade, or declassify the information.</P>
            <P>(b) The person who applies derivative classification markings shall observe and respect original classification decisions; and carry forward to any newly created documents any assigned authorized markings. The declassification date or event that provides the longest period of classification shall be used for documents classified on the basis of multiple sources.</P>

            <P>Executive Order 12958 prescribes a uniform system for classifying, declassifying, and safeguarding national security information.</P>
            <P>(a) Information shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. The National Science Foundation shall coordinate their review of classified information with other agencies that have a direct interests in the subject matter. Information that continues to meet the classification requirements prescribed by Section 1.3 despite the passage of time will continue to be protected in accordance with Executive Order 12958.</P>
            <P>(b) Foundation documents may be declassified or downgraded by the official who authorized the original classification, if that official is still serving in the same position; the originator's successor; a supervisory official of either; or officials delegated such authority in writing by the Director.</P>
            <P>(c) The Director shall conduct internal systematic review programs for classified information originated by the Foundation contained in records determined by the Archivist to be permanently valuable but that have not been accessioned into the National Archives of the United States.</P>
            <P>(d) The Archivist of the United States shall, in accordance with procedures and timeframes prescribed in the Information Security Oversight Office's directives implementing Executive Order 12958, systematically review for declassification or downgrading, classified records accessioned into the National Archives of the United States. Such information shall be reviewed by the Archivist for declassification or downgrading in accordance with systematic review guidelines that shall be provided by the head of the agency that originated the information, or in the case of foreign government information, by the Director of Information Security Oversight Office in consultation with interested agency heads.</P>

            <P>(a) The Division of Administrative Services is hereby designated as the office to which members of the public or Departments may direct requests for mandatory review for declassification under this provision. In the case of documents originally classified by the Foundation, this office shall, in turn, assign the request to the appropriate office for action within 60 days. In each instance, receipt of the request will be acknowledged in writing immediately <PRTPAGE P="43"/>by the office that has been assigned action. A request for classification review must reasonably describe the document.</P>
            <P>(b) Whenever a request is deficient in its description of the record sought, the requester should be asked to provide additional identifying information to the extent possible. Whenever a request does not reasonably describe the information sought, the requester shall be notified that unless additional information is provided or the scope of the request is narrowed, no further action will be undertaken. Upon a determination that the requested material no longer warrants classification, it shall be declassified and made promptly available to the requester, if not otherwise exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (Freedom of Information Act) or other provision of law. If the information may not be released in whole or in part the requester shall be given a brief statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination of the Classification Review Committee, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed with the Foundation within 60 days in order to be considered.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 604.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

              <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of <PRTPAGE P="48"/>his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
              <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>
              <P>(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.</P>

Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>

              <P>(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.<PRTPAGE P="49"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.</P>
              <P>(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.</P>

              <P>(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.</P>
              <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>
              <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
              <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
              <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

Paragraph (c) of § 605.5 has been removed, and “qualified handicapped persons” has been substituted for “handicapped persons” wherever that phrase appears in § 605.4(b)(5) and in subpart C (§§ 605.21 through 605.23). The date for compliance with § 605.33(d) has been changed.</P>

              <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That: (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap, and (2) the results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Accessibility.</E> A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to qualified handicapped persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) <PRTPAGE P="63"/>of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 605.23, or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to qualified handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Small health, welfare, or other social service providers.</E> If a recipient with fewer than fifteen employees that provides health, welfare, or other social services finds, after consultation with a qualified handicapped person seeking its services, that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant alteration in its existing facilities, the recipient may, as an alternative, refer the qualified handicapped person to other providers of those services that are accessible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time period.</E> A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including qualified handicapped persons or organizations representing qualified handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to qualified handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under paragraph (a) of this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify the steps of that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
              <P>(4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usuable by qualified handicapped persons.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program shall provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's handicap.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appropriate education.</E> (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of §§ 605.34, 605.35 and 605.36.</P>
              <P>(2) Implementation of an Individualized Education Program developed in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) A recipient may place a handicapped person or refer such person for aid, benefits, or services other than those that it operates or provides as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subpart are met with respect to any handicapped person so placed or referred.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Free education</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> For the purpose of this section, the provision of a free education is the provision of educational and related services without cost to the handicapped person or to his or her parents or guardian, except for those fees that are imposed on non-handicapped persons or their parents or guardian. It may consist either of the provision of free services or, if a recipient places a handicapped person or refers such person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, of <PRTPAGE P="65"/>payment for the costs of the aid, benefits, or services. Funds available from any public or private agency may be used to meet the requirements of this subpart. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or pay for services provided to a handicapped person.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Transportation.</E> If a recipient places a handicapped person or refers such person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from the aid, benefits, or services is provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the person or his or her parents or guardian if the person were placed in the program operated by the recipient.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Residential placement.</E> If a public or private residential placement is necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person because of his or her handicap, the placement, including non-medical care and room and board, shall be provided at no cost to the person or his or her parents or guardian.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Placement of handicapped persons by parents.</E> If a recipient has made available, in conformance with the requirements of this section and § 605.34, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person and the person's parents or guardian chooses to place the person in a private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made a free appropriate public education available or otherwise regarding the question of financial responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of § 605.36.</P>

              <P>(1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their producer;</P>
              <P>(2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and</P>
              <P>(3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Placement procedures.</E> In interpreting evaluation data and in making placement decisions, a recipient shall (1) draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, teacher recommendations, physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to ensure that information obtained from all such sources is documented and carefully considered, (3) ensure that the placement decision is made by a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, and (4) ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with § 605.34.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reevaluation.</E> A recipient to which this section applies shall establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this requirement.</P>

              <P>(1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of handicapped persons who may be admitted;</P>

              <P>(2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons unless (i) the test or criterion, as used by the recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity in question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Director to be available.<PRTPAGE P="68"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a handicapped person but, after admission, may make inquiries on a confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Preadmission inquiry exception.</E> When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 605.6(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 605.6(6), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action efforts; and</P>
              <P>(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Validity studies.</E> For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of overall success in the education program or activity in question in order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other rules.</E> A recipient to which this subpart applies may not impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibition of tape recorders in classrooms or of dog guides in campus buildings, that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in the recipient's education program or activity.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Course examinations.</E> In its course examinations or other procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement, a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results of the evaluation represents the student's achievement in the course, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Auxiliary aids.</E> (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the education program or activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.</P>
              <P>(2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. Recipients need not provide attendents, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature.</P>

The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities.

            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Foundation shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the Foundation to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or</P>
            <P>(2) Require the Foundation to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Foundation personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Foundation has the initial burden of establishing that compliance with § 606.51(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Foundation Director or his or her designee after considering all Foundation resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or burdens, the Foundation shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The Foundation may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The Foundation is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Foundation, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Foundation shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The Foundation shall comply with the obligations established under this section within 60 days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Foundation shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The Foundation shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Foundation's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>

            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;<PRTPAGE P="76"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>

            <P>(1) The Foundation shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the Foundation.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Foundation shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Foundation need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the Foundation communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) The Foundation shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
            <P>(c) The Foundation shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the Foundation to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Foundation personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Foundation has the initial burden of establishing that compliance with § 606.60 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Foundation Director or his or her designee after considering all Foundation resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Foundation shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(b) The Foundation shall process complaints alleging violations of section 504 with respect to employment <PRTPAGE P="77"/>according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).</P>

In accordance with the procedures outlined below, the Foundation will accept all complete complaints and will either undertake to investigate them if they are within the jurisdiction of the Foundation and submitted within 180 days of the alleged acts of discrimination or in the case of complaints not within the jurisdiction of the Foundation, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity. Complete complaints submitted after the 180 day time limit may also be acted upon at the discretion of the Foundation if good cause for the delay in submission is found.</P>
            <P>(e) The Foundation shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or a facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(f) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint, the Director, Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (OEOP), or his or her designee or delegate, will investigate the complaint and shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—</P>

            <SUBJECT>Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When the NSF is the creditor agency and the Chief Financial Officer determines that an employee of another agency (i.e., the paying agency) owes a debt to the NSF, the Chief Financial Officer shall, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) Certify in writing to the paying agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment was due, and the date the Government's right to collect the debt accrued, and that this part 607 has been approved by the Office of Personnel Management.</P>
            <P>(2) Unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures, and the written consent is sent to the paying agency, the Chief Financial Officer must advise the paying agency of the action(s) taken under this part 607, and the date(s) they were taken.</P>
            <P>(3) Request the paying agency to collect the debt by salary offset. If deductions must be made in installments, the Chief Financial Officer may recommend to the paying agency the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment;</P>
            <P>(4) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the employee.</P>
            <P>(b) When the NSF is the creditor agency and the employee is in the process of separating from the Federal service, the NSF must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify the total amount collected, give a copy of the certification to the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the NSF. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments, it must certify to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt, including the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1108 have been followed.</P>
            <P>(c) When the NSF is the creditor agency and the employee has already separated from Federal service and all payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the Chief Financial Officer may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset.</P>
            <P>(d) When the NSF is the paying agency, upon receipt of a properly certified debt claim from another agency, deductions will be scheduled to begin at the next established pay interval. The employee must receive written notice that NSF has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt, the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). NSF shall not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity or the amount of the certified claim. If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor agency has submitted its debt claim to NSF and before the debt is collected completely, NSF must certify the amount collected. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee. A copy must be furnished to the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer.</P>

Debts will be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, collection must be made in installments.</P>
            <P>(b) Debts will be collected by deduction at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account unless alternative arrangements for repayment are made.</P>
            <P>(c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction for the pay intervals for any period must not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.</P>
            <P>(d) Unliquidated debts may be offset against any financial payment due to a separated employee including but not limited to final salary or leave payment in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716.</P>

            <P>(b) Another creditor agency will promptly return to NSF any amounts deducted by NSF to satisfy debts owed to the creditor agency when the debt is waived, found not owed, or when directed by an administrative or judicial order.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part sets forth policies and procedures for the collection and compromise claims and the administrative offset of claims by the National Science Foundation (NSF) pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3716, 3718 and 3720A. It is not intended to limit or govern the rights of the NSF or the United States to collect, compromise, or administratively offset debts or claims under other authority and procedures that may be legally available to it.</P>
            <P>(b) Matters not addressed in this part should be reviewed and handled in accordance with applicable statutory provisions and the Federal Claims Collection Standards issued jointly by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General (4 CFR parts 101 through 105).</P>

            <P>(c) Any action other than the issuance of regulations specifically required to be done by the head of the agency by any of the statutes or regulations referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be done on behalf of NSF by its Chief Financial <PRTPAGE P="82"/>Officer or by those to whom the Chief Financial Officer delegates authority. This is not intended to prevent the Chief Financial Officer from issuing additional internal procedures and guidance consistent with this part.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 608.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Collection, compromise, and use of consumer reporting agencies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Subject to the specific limitations and procedures of 31 U.S.C. 3711 and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, NSF, acting through its Chief Financial Officer or those to whom he or she delegates authority or assigns responsibilities, shall try to collect claims of the United States Government for money or property arising out of the activities of NSF or that are referred to NSF and may compromise or suspend or end collection action of certain claims. In making demands for payment, NSF will follow the guidance set forth at 4 CFR 102.2. In appropriate cases, as authorized by and subject to 31 U.S.C. 3718 and 4 CFR 102.6, NSF may contract for collection services. Before compromising or suspending or ending the collection of a claim in excess of $5,000, the matter shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review.</P>

            <P>(b) When trying to collect a claim of the Government (except for claims under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), NSF may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information from a system of records that an individual is responsible for a claim if (1) a notice published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(3)(4) indicates that information in the system of records may be disclosed to a consumer reporting agency that an individual is responsible for a claim and (2) if the Chief Financial Officer of NSF decides that the claim is valid and overdue. Such disclosures to a consumer reporting agency will be done only under the conditions and procedures specified in 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) and in the Federal Claims Collections Standards. Specifically, before NSF provides the information to the consumer reporting agency, the individual will be given the notice required by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f)(1)(C); and in accordance with 4 CFR 102.5(c), the right of administrative review to be provided to the individual shall be consistent with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.3(c). If NSF does not have a current address for the individual in its files, it will take reasonable action to locate the individual, but if unsuccessful will mail the notice to the individual's last known address. NSF will disclose information only to a consumer reporting agency that gives satisfactory assurances that it is complying with all laws of the United States relating to providing consumer credit information. The information provided by NSF shall be limited to the type of information described in 31 U.S.C. 3711(f)(1)(F). Moreover, NSF will not provide such information until it has established internal procedures to disclose promptly to a consumer reporting agency to which disclosure is made of any substantial changes in the condition or amount of the claim and to verify or correct promptly information about the claim on request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of information disclosed.</P>
            <P>(c) If in response to the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the individual repays or agrees in writing with NSF to a repayment plan, the information will not be disclosed to a consumer reporting agency. If in response to the notice referred to in paragraph (b) the individual requests a review or reconsideration of the claim, information shall not be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency until such a review is provided.</P>
            <P>(d) The review referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall be based only on the written documentation in the file, including any additional written information provided by the individual in response to the notice referred to in paragraph (b). A written summary briefly describing the nature of the review performed and the conclusion reached shall be made. The written summary and conclusion shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review. After legal review, a copy of the written summary shall be sent to the individual.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative offset.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If NSF is unable to collect a claim from a person after trying to do so in <PRTPAGE P="83"/>accordance with § 608.2, NSF may collect the claim by administrative offset subject to the procedures and limitations of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards. Determinations to pursue administrative offset shall be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the considerations specified at 31 U.S.C. 3716(b) and 4 CFR 102.3(a). Before employing administrative offset, NSF will comply with the notice, hearing, review, or other procedural requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and 4 CFR 102.3(b) and (c). Furthermore, before an administrative offset is taken by NSF pursuant to the authority of this part 608, the matter shall be referred to the Office of General Counsel for legal review to ensure that the required procedures have been followed.</P>
            <P>(b) When another agency requests NSF to administratively offset a claim owing to that agency, NSF will normally comply with such request if the requesting agency has provided the certification required by 4 CFR 102.3(f) and offset would not be contrary to law. Before imposing administrative offsets at the request of another agency under this part 608, the matter shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) In appropriate cases, NSF may request another agency to administratively setoff a claim owed to NSF. Before making the certification to the other agency required by 4 CFR 102.3(f), the matter shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review.</P>
            <P>(2) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, NSF may request that moneys that are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Foreign Service Retirement Fund or any other Federal retirement fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments debts owed the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the respective fund servicing agency in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by that agency. The requests for administrative offset will certify in writing that (i) the debtor owes the United States a debt and the amount of the debt; (ii) NSF has complied with applicable regulations and procedures; and (iii) NSF has followed the requirements of the Federal Claims Collection Standards as made applicable by this section. Once NSF decides to request offset from a Federal retirement fund, it will make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that the fund servicing agency may identify and flag the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the fund and to ensure that offset will be initiated prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.</P>
            <P>(3) If NSF collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to this paragraph (c), NSF shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset.</P>
            <P>(4) This paragraph (c) does not require or authorize the fund servicing agency to review the merits of (i) NSF's determination with respect to the amount and validity of the debt, (ii) NSF's determination as to waiver under an applicable statute, or (iii) NSF's determination to provide or not provide an oral hearing.</P>
            <P>(d) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than ten years unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering the debt.</P>
            <P>(e) Administrative offset under this section will not be initiated against:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reductions of tax refunds.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In accordance with regulations and guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 and the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A, NSF will participate in the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program for offset against income tax refunds of persons owing past due legally enforceable debts to NSF.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the United States and:</P>
            <P>(1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months but has not been delinquent for more than ten years at the time the offset is made;</P>
            <P>(2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);</P>
            <P>(3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by NSF against amounts payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of NSF;</P>
            <P>(4) With respect to which NSF has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax;</P>
            <P>(5) With respect to which NSF has given the taxpayer at least 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, has considered the evidence presented by such taxpayer, and has determined that an amount of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable;</P>
            <P>(6) Has been disclosed by NSF to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00;</P>
            <P>(7) Is at least $25.00;</P>
            <P>(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Internal Revenue Service regulations at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.</P>
            <P>(c) NSF will make a request for reduction of an IRS tax refund only after the NSF determines that an amount is owed and past-due and provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. NSF's notice of intention to collect by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of the NSF's Notice of Intent, NSF intends to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges;</P>
            <P>(3) That the debtor has a right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable; and</P>
            <P>(4) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and a contact name and phone number for any questions.</P>
            <P>(d) A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent has the right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor must:</P>
            <P>(1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the address provided in the notice.</P>
            <P>(2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally enforceable.</P>
            <P>(3) Include with the request any documents which the debtor wishes to be considered or state that additional information will be submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period.</P>

            <P>(e) The failure of a debtor to respond as provided in paragraph (d) of this section will result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without further action by NSF. If the debtor responds, NSF will consider all available evidence related to the debt and issue a written determination, including supporting rationale, whether its prior determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable is sustained, amended, or canceled. Before this determination is made the matter shall be referred to the NSF Office of General Counsel for legal review. NSF will <PRTPAGE P="85"/>give prompt notification of this determination to the debtor.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the “Act”) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the National Science Foundation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application of part.</SUBJECT>

            <P>This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Foundation, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A of this part. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this part, (c) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary, or (d) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 611.3. The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in the appendix shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person in the United States, shall, on grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient to which this part applies may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:</P>
            <P>(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;</P>
            <P>(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
            <P>(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>

            <P>(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other <PRTPAGE P="86"/>requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
            <P>(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program of an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.</P>
            <P>(4) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (i) to assist such individuals through employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training or (ii) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of such individuals.</P>

            <P>(2) Types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A as respects employment opportunities provided thereunder, or in facilities provided thereunder, which are limited, or for which preference is given, to students, <PRTPAGE P="87"/>fellows, or other persons, including research associates, where in training for the same or related employments, have one of the above purposes as a primary purpose.</P>
            <P>(3) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.</P>
            <P>(4) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Medical emergencies.</E> Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health, and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assurances required.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal Financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible Foundation official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>

            <P>(2) In the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interest therein, from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property or interest therein from the Federal Government is involved, but property is acquired or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. When the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the <PRTPAGE P="88"/>Foundation to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Foundation official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Foundation official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to subordinate such right of reversion to the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance.</P>
            <P>(3) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. (41 CFR 101-6.2.)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Elementary and secondary schools.</E> The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible Official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan. In any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the responsible Official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Assurances from institutions.</E> (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research for a special training project, or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.</P>
            <P>(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.</P>

            <P>The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the programs aided by the Foundation. (In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this part, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance.)

              <HD SOURCE="HED">1.</HD>
              <P>For support to elementary or secondary schools such as for the acquisition of equipment discrimination by the recipient school district in any of its elementary or secondary schools, or by the recipient private institution, in the admission of students, or in the treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In this and the following illustration the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">2.</HD>

              <P>In a research, training, or other grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the <PRTPAGE P="89"/>graduate school is prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">3.</HD>
              <P>In a training grant to a hospital or other nonacademic institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an institution, discrimination is prohibited with respect to any educational activity, any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">4.</HD>
              <P>In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for research or for the provision of educational services, assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be prohibited as a condition of Federal operating grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research, or other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of students. In other construction grants the assurances required will similarly be adapted to the nature of the activities to be conducted in the facilities for construction of which the grants have been authorized by Congress.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">5.</HD>
              <P>Upon transfers of real or personal property for research or educational uses, discrimination is prohibited to the same extent as in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision of equipment for like purposes.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">6.</HD>
              <P>In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 611.6(d) to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served but not the establishment of discriminatory qualifications for participation in any program.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">7.</HD>
              <P>Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.</P>

            <P>(1) The responsible Foundation official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,</P>
            <P>(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearings, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part,</P>

            <P>(4) The expiration of thirty days after the Director has filed with the Committee of the House and the Committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.</P>
            <FP>Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</FP>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Foundation official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least ten days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person.

The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 611.8(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Foundation in Arlington, VA, at a time fixed by the responsible Foundation official unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Foundation requires that another place be selected.

            <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Director may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 611.10.</P>

Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible Foundation official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Foundation official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision.

Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Foundation official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</P>
            <P>(3) If the responsible Foundation official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Foundation official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This part contains the rules that the National Science Foundation (NSF) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. Information routinely made available to the public as part of a regular Foundation activity (for example, program announcements and solicitations, summary of awarded proposals, statistical reports on U.S. science, press releases issued by the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs) may be provided to the public without reliance on this part. As a matter of policy, the Foundation also makes discretionary disclosures of <PRTPAGE P="96"/>records or information otherwise exempt under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. This policy, however, does not create any right enforceable in court. When individuals seek records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, NSF processes those requests under both NSF's Privacy regulations at part 613 of this chapter, and this part.</P>
            <P>(b) As used in this part, NSF includes one component, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Public reading room.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Foundation maintains a public reading room located in the NSF Library at 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 225, Arlington, Virginia, open during regular working hours Monday through Friday. It contains the records that the FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public inspection and copying and has computers and printers available for public use in accessing records. Also available for public inspection and copying are current subject matter indexes of reading room records.</P>

            <P>(b) Information about FOIA and Privacy at NSF and copies of frequently requested FOIA releases are available online at <E T="03">www.nsf.gov/policies/foia/jsp.</E> Most NSF policy documents, staff instructions, manuals, and other publications that affect a member of the public, are available in electronic form through the “Publications” option on the tool bar on NSF's Home Page on the World Wide Web at <E T="03">www.nsf.gov.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for making requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Where to send a request.</E> You may make a FOIA request for records of the National Science Foundation by writing directly to the NSF FOIA Officer, Office of the General Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1265, Arlington, VA 22230. Requests may also be sent by facsimile to (703) 292-9041 or by email to <E T="03">foia@nsf.gov.</E> The National Science Foundation includes one agency component, the NSF Office of the Inspector General (OIG). For records maintained by the NSF OIG, you may write directly to the Office of Inspector General, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1135, Arlington, VA 22230. Requests may also be sent to the OIG by facsimile to (703) 292-9158. The NSF FOIA Officer and the OIG component will also forward requests as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of request.</E> A FOIA request need not be in any particular format, but it must be in writing, include the requester's name and mailing address, and be clearly identified both on the envelope and in the letter, or in a facsimile or electronic mail message as a Freedom of Information Act or “FOIA” request. It must describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to permit identification, and include agreement to pay applicable fees as described in § 612.10. NSF and its OIG component are not obligated to act upon a request until it meets these procedural requirements.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Personal records.</E> (1) If you are making a request for records about yourself and the records are not contained in a Privacy Act system of records, your request will be processed only under the FOIA, since the Privacy Act does not apply. If the records about you are contained in a Privacy Act system of records, NSF will respond with information on how to make a Privacy Act request (see NSF Privacy Act regulations at 45 CFR 613.2).</P>
            <P>(2) If you are making a request for personal information about another individual, either a written authorization signed by that individual in accordance with § 613.2(f) of this chapter permitting disclosure of those records to you, or proof that that individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or a published obituary) will help the agency process your request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> Your request must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable NSF personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. A record must have been created or obtained by NSF and be under the control of NSF at the time of the request to be subject to the FOIA. NSF has no obligation under the FOIA to create, compile, or obtain a record to satisfy a FOIA request. Whenever possible, your request <PRTPAGE P="97"/>should include specific descriptive information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the records or type of records that you want, the more likely the Foundation will be able to locate those records in response to your request, and the more likely fees will be reduced or eliminated. If NSF determines that your request does not reasonably describe records, you will be advised what additional information is needed to perfect your request or why your request is otherwise insufficient.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> Your request must state that you will promptly pay the total fees chargeable under this regulation or set a maximum amount you are willing to pay. NSF does not charge if fees total less than $25.00. If you seek a waiver of fees, please see § 612.10(k) for a discussion of the factors you must address. If you place an inadequate limit on the amount you will pay, or have failed to make payments for previous requests, NSF may require advance payment (see § 612.10(i)).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Receipt date.</E> A request that meets the requirements of this section will be considered received on the date it is properly received by the Office of the General Counsel or the Office of the Inspector General. In determining which records are responsive to a FOIA request, the NSF will include only records in its possession as of the date the NSF or OIG begins its search. If any other date is used, the NSF or OIG shall inform the requester of that date.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Publications excluded.</E> For the purpose of public requests for records the term “record” does not include publications which are available to the public in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> or by sale or free distribution. Such publications may be obtained from the Government Printing Office, the National Technical Information Service, or through NSF's Home Page on the World Wide Web at <E T="03">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/.</E> Requests for such publications will be referred to or the requester informed of the appropriate source.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 612.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Processing requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Monitoring of requests.</E> The NSF Office of the General Counsel (OGC), or such other office as may be designated by the Director, will serve as the central office for administering these regulations. For records maintained by the Office of Inspector General, that Office will control incoming requests made directly or referred to it, dispatch response letters, and maintain administrative records. For all other records maintained by NSF, OGC (or such other office as may be designated by the Director) will control incoming requests, assign them to appropriate action offices, monitor compliance, consult with action offices on disclosure, approve necessary extensions, dispatch denial and other letters, and maintain administrative records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals.</E> When the NSF receives a request for a record in its possession that originated with another agency or in which another agency has a substantial interest, it may decide that the other agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record should or should not be released under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(1) If the NSF determines that it is the agency best able to process the record in response to the request, then it will do so, after consultation with the other interested agencies where appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) If it determines that it is not the agency best able to process the record, then it will refer the request regarding that record (or portion of the record) to the agency that originated or has a substantial interest in the record in question (but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.</P>
            <P>(3) Whenever NSF refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily will notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred, unless such notification would disclose information otherwise exempt.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 612.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The NSF and its component, OIG, ordinarily will initiate processing of requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> (1) NSF and OIG may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, including through limits based on the number of pages involved. If NSF or OIG does so, it shall advise requesters in its slower track(s) of the limits of its faster track(s).</P>
            <P>(2) NSF or OIG using multitrack processing may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of the NSF's or OIG's faster track(s). The requester may be contacted by telephone, email, or letter, whichever is more efficient in each case.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> The NSF will seek to take appropriate action within 20 days of when a request is properly received or is perfected (excluding the date of receipt, weekends, and legal holidays), whichever is later. A request which otherwise meets the requirements of § 612.3 is perfected when you have reasonably described the records sought under § 612.3(d), and agreed to pay fees under § 612.3(e), or otherwise met the fee requirements under § 612.10.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> (1) Where the time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of unusual circumstances, as defined in the FOIA, the NSF FOIA Officer or the OIG component will notify the requester as soon as practicable in writing of the unusual circumstances and may extend the response period for up to ten working days.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the extension is for more than ten working days, the FOIA Officer or the OIG component will provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the ten day extension period or to arrange an agreed upon alternative time period with the FOIA Officer or the OIG component for processing the request or a modified request.</P>
            <P>(3) Where the NSF reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) If you want to receive expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Requests and appeals will be given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that a requester has demonstrated compelling need by presenting:</P>
            <P>(A) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(B) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>
            <P>(ii) For example, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that he or she is a person whose main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. Such requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally, and that the information sought has particular value that would be lost if not disseminated quickly.</P>

            <P>(3) Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the NSF FOIA Officer or OIG component will decide whether to grant it, and will notify the requester of the decision orally or in writing. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for <PRTPAGE P="99"/>expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 612.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of requests.</E> The NSF or OIG will ordinarily send an email acknowledgment of all FOIA requests with an assigned request number for further reference and an estimated response date.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> Once the NSF makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The NSF will inform the requester in the notice of any applicable fee and will disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of applicable fees. Records disclosed in part will be marked or annotated to show both the amount and the location of the information deleted where practicable.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Denials of requests.</E> (1) Denials of FOIA requests will be made by the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of the Inspector General, or such other office as may be designated by the Director. The response letter will briefly set forth the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied in denying the request. It will also provide the name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial, will inform the requester of the right to appeal, and will, where appropriate, include an estimate of the volume of any requested materials withheld. An estimate need not be provided when the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.</P>
            <P>(2) Requesters can appeal an agency determination to withhold all or part of any requested record; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the Act; a disapproval of a fee category claim by a requester; denial of a fee waiver or reduction; or a denial of a request for expedited treatment (see § 612.9).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 612.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemptions from disclosure.</E> The following types of records or information may be withholdable as exempt in full or in part from mandatory public disclosure:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemption 1-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1).</E> Records specifically authorized and properly classified pursuant to Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. NSF does not have classifying authority and normally does not deal with classified materials.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemption 2-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2).</E> Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of NSF. Examples of records normally exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to: Information relating to position management and manpower utilization, such as internal staffing plans, authorizations or controls, or involved in determination of the qualifications of candidates for employment, advancement, or promotion including examination questions and answers.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Exemption 3-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).</E> Records specifically exempted from disclosure by another statute that either requires that the information be withheld in a such way that the agency has no discretion in the matter; or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of information to be withheld; and, if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, October 28, 2009, specifically cites to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3). Examples of records exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Records that disclose any invention in which the Federal Government owns or may own a right, title, or interest (including a nonexclusive license), 35 U.S.C. 205;</P>
            <P>(ii) Contractor proposals not specifically set forth or incorporated by reference into a contract, 41 U.S.C. 253b(m);</P>
            <P>(iii) Information protected by the Procurement Integrity Act, 41 U.S.C. 423;</P>

            <P>(iv) Statistical information protected by section 14(i) of the NSF Act of 1950, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1873(i) and/or the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note.<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Exemption 4-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</E> Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person, and privileged or confidential. Information subject to this exemption is that customarily held in confidence by the originator(s), including nonprofit organizations and their employees. Release of such information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the originator or submitter, or impair the Foundation's ability to obtain such information in the future. NSF will process information potentially exempted from disclosure by Exemption 4 under § 612.8.</P>
            <P>Examples of records or information normally exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Information received in confidence, such as grant applications, fellowship applications, and research proposals prior to award;</P>
            <P>(ii) Confidential scientific and manufacturing processes or developments, and technical, scientific, statistical data or other information developed by a grantee;</P>
            <P>(iii) Technical, scientific, or statistical data, and commercial or financial information privileged or received in confidence from an existing or potential contractor or subcontractor, in connection with bids, proposals, or contracts, concerning contract performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures, as well as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other proprietary data. When the provisions of 41 U.S.C. 253b(m) or 41 U.S.C. 423 are met, certain proprietary and source selection information may also be withheld under Exemption 3;</P>
            <P>(iv) Confidential proprietary information submitted on a voluntary basis;</P>
            <P>(v) Statements or information collected in the course of inspections, investigations, or audits, when such statements are received in confidence from the individual and retained in confidence because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information normally considered confidential or privileged.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Exemption 5-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5).</E> Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with NSF. Factual material contained in such records will be considered for release if it can be reasonably segregated and is not otherwise exempt. Examples of records exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Those portions of reports, memoranda, correspondence, workpapers, minutes of meetings, and staff papers, containing evaluations, advice, opinions, suggestions, or other deliberative material that are prepared for use within NSF or within the Executive Branch of the Government by agency personnel and others acting in a consultant or advisory capacity;</P>
            <P>(ii) Advance information on proposed NSF plans to procure, lease, or otherwise acquire, or dispose of materials, real estate, facilities, services or functions, when such information would provide undue or unfair competitive advantage to private interests or impede legitimate government functions;</P>
            <P>(iii) Negotiating positions or limits at least until the execution of a contract (including a grant or cooperative agreement) or the completion of the action to which the negotiating positions were applicable. They may also be exempt pursuant to other provisions of this section;</P>
            <P>(iv) Trade secret or other confidential research development, or commercial information owned by the Government, where premature release is likely to affect the Government's negotiating position or other commercial interest;</P>
            <P>(iv) Records prepared for use in proceedings before any Federal or State court or administrative body;</P>
            <P>(vi) Evaluations of and comments on specific grant applications, research projects or proposals, fellowship applications or nominations or other individual awards, or potential contractors and their products, whether made by NSF personnel or by external reviewers acting either individually or in panels, committees or similar groups;</P>
            <P>(vii) Preliminary, draft or unapproved documents, such as opinions, recommendations, evaluations, decisions, or studies conducted or supported by NSF;</P>

            <P>(viii) Proposed budget requests, and supporting projections used or arising in the preparation and/or execution of <PRTPAGE P="101"/>a budget; proposed annual and multi-year policy, priorities, program and financial plan and supporting papers;</P>
            <P>(ix) Those portions of official reports of inspection, reports of the Inspector General, audits, investigations, or surveys pertaining to safety, security, or the internal management, administration, or operation of NSF, when these records have traditionally been treated by the courts as privileged against disclosure in litigation.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Exemption 6-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6).</E> Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The exemption may apply to protect the privacy of living persons and of living close survivors of a deceased person identified in a record. Information in such files which is not otherwise exempt from disclosure pursuant to other provisions of this section will be released to the subject or to his designated legal representative, and may be disclosed to others with the subject's written consent. Examples of records exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Reports, records, and other materials pertaining to individual cases in which disciplinary or other administrative action has been or may be taken. Opinions and orders resulting from those administrative or disciplinary proceedings shall be disclosed without identifying details if used, cited, or relied upon as precedent;</P>
            <P>(ii) Records compiled to evaluate or adjudicate the suitability of candidates for employment, and the eligibility of individuals (civilian or contractor employees) for security clearances, or for access to classified information;</P>
            <P>(iii) Reports and evaluations which reflect upon the qualifications or competence of individuals;</P>
            <P>(iv) Personal information such as home addresses and telephone and facsimile numbers, private email addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, marital status and the like;</P>
            <P>(v) The exemption also applies when the fact of the existence or nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal personal, private information, and the public interest in disclosure is not sufficient to outweigh the privacy interest.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Exemption 7-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7).</E> Records or information compiled for civil or criminal law enforcement purposes, including the implementation of Executive Orders or regulations issued pursuant to law. This exemption may exempt from mandatory disclosure records not originally created, but later gathered, for law enforcement purposes.</P>
            <P>(i) This exemption applies only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
            <P>(A) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
            <P>(B) Would deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
            <P>(C) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of a living person, or living close survivors of a deceased person identified in a record;</P>
            <P>(D) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a source within the Federal Government, or a State, local, or foreign agency or authority, or any private institution, that furnished information on a confidential basis; and information furnished by a confidential source and obtained by a criminal law enforcement authority in a criminal investigation;</P>
            <P>(E) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or</P>
            <P>(F) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</P>
            <P>(ii) Examples of records normally exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:</P>

            <P>(A) The identity and statements of complainants or witnesses, or other material developed during the course of an investigation and all materials prepared in connection with related government litigation or adjudicative proceedings;<PRTPAGE P="102"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) The identity of firms or individuals investigated for alleged irregularities involving NSF grants, contracts or other matters when no indictment has been obtained, no civil action has been filed against them by the United States, or no government-wide public suspension or debarment has occurred;</P>
            <P>(C) Information obtained in confidence, expressed or implied, in the course of a criminal investigation by the NSF Office of the Inspector General.</P>
            <P>(iii) The exclusions contained in 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1) and (2) may also apply to these records.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Exemption 8-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8).</E> Records contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of any agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Exemption 9-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9).</E> Records containing geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Deletion of exempt portions and identifying details.</E> Any reasonably segregable portion of a record will be provided to requesters after deletion of the portions which are exempt. Whenever any final opinion, order, or other materials required to be made available relates to a private party or parties and the release of the name(s) or other identifying details will constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the record shall be published or made available with such identifying details left blank, or shall be published or made available with obviously fictitious substitutes and with a notification such as the following: Names of parties and certain other identifying details have been removed (and fictitious names substituted) in order to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the individuals involved.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Business information obtained by the Foundation from a submitter of that information will be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section's procedures.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Business Information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by the Foundation from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA and § 612.7(a)(4).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity from whom the Foundation obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of business information.</E> A submitter of business information must use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> The Foundation will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its business information wherever required under this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information under paragraph (f) of this section. The notice shall either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Where notice is required.</E> Notice will be given to a submitter wherever:</P>
            <P>(1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
            <P>(2) The Foundation has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> NSF will allow a submitter a reasonable time, consistent with statutory requirements, to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it must submit a detailed written statement. The statement <PRTPAGE P="103"/>must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, must show why the information is a trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that a submitter fails to respond within the time specified in the notice, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be a record subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The Foundation will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever it decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, the Foundation will give the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</P>
            <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section will not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) The Foundation determines that the information should not be disclosed (the Foundation protects from disclosure to third parties information about specific unfunded applications, including pending, withdrawn, or declined proposals);</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 235); or</P>
            <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous, in which case the Foundation will, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the Foundation will promptly notify the submitter(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the Foundation will notify the requester(s).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appeals of denials.</E> You may appeal a denial of your request to the General Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1265, Arlington, VA 22230. You must make your appeal in writing and it must be received by the Office of the General Counsel within ten days of the receipt of the denial (weekends, legal holidays, and the date of receipt excluded). You must clearly mark your appeal letter and the envelope or your electronic submission as a “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” Your appeal letter must include a copy of your written request and the denial together with any written argument you wish to submit.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> A written decision on your appeal will be made by the General Counsel. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will contain a statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform you of the FOIA provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, you will be notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> If you wish to seek review by a court of any denial, you must first appeal it under this section.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 612.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fees</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> NSF will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (k) of this section. If fees are applicable, NSF will <PRTPAGE P="104"/>itemize the amounts charged. NSF may collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because NSF has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, NSF will provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenses that an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or compact disk) among others. NSF will honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible by NSF, with reasonable effort, in the requested form or format.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use or to promote any particular product or industry, but are sought to further scientific research.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Representative of the news media or news media requester</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. For “freelance” journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but NSF shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Review</E> means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether <PRTPAGE P="105"/>any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure, for example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under § 612.8, but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page by page or line by line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in paper or electronic form or format, or stored in Federal Records Centers. NSF will ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible. For example, NSF will not search line by line where duplicating an entire document would be quicker and less expensive.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, NSF will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search.</E> (i) Search fees will be charged for all requests, other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. NSF may charge for time spent searching even if responsive records are not located or are withheld entirely as exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Manual searches for records.</E> Whenever feasible, NSF will charge at the salary rate(s) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the search. Where a homogeneous class of personnel is used exclusively (e.g., all administrative/clerical or all professional/executive), NSF has established an average rate for the range of grades typically involved. Routine search for records by administrative personnel are charged at $5.50 for each quarter hour. When a non-routine, non-clerical search by professional personnel is conducted (for example, where the task of determining which records fall within a request requires professional time) the charge is $11.50 for each quarter hour.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Computer searches of records.</E> NSF will charge at the actual direct cost of conducting the search. This will include the cost of operating the computer system(s) for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a FOIA request and operator/programmer salary (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> basic pay plus 16 percent) apportionable to the search. When NSF can establish a reasonable agency-wide average rate for computer operating costs and operator/programmer salaries involved in FOIA searches, the Foundation will do so and charge accordingly.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Archived records.</E> For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by NSF at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs will be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee will be ten cents per page. For copies produced by computer, such as print outs, tapes, compact disks, or other electronic media, NSF will charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, NSF will charge the direct costs of that duplication.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> Review fees will be charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review, in other words, the review done when NSF determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion at the initial request level. NSF may charge for review even <PRTPAGE P="106"/>if a record ultimately is not disclosed. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records or record portions withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies; the costs of that review are chargeable where it is made necessary by a change of circumstances. Review fees will be charged at the salary rate (basic pay plus 16%) of the employee(s) performing the review.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations on charging fees.</E> (1) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media. (2) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, NSF will provide without charge:</P>
            <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).</P>
            <P>(3) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.</P>
            <P>(4) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section work together. This means that noncommercial requesters will be charged no fees unless the cost of search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages totals more than $25.00. Commercial requesters will not be charged unless the costs of search, review, and duplication total more than $25.00.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> When NSF determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section will exceed $25.00, it will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, NSF will advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees exceed $25.00, the request will not be considered perfected and further work will not be done until the requester agrees to pay the anticipated total fee. Any such agreement should be memorialized in writing. A notice under this paragraph will offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter with Foundation personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost, if possible. If a requester fails to respond within 60 days of notice of actual or estimated fees with an agreement to pay those fees, NSF may administratively close the request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> Apart from the other provisions of this section, when NSF chooses as a matter of administrative discretion to provide a requested special service such as certifying that records are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged to the requester.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> NSF may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by NSF. NSF may follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> Where NSF reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the agency may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. NSF may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, NSF will aggregate them only where there exists a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i) (2) and (3) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="107"/>NSF will not require the requester to make an advance payment, -in other words, a payment made before work is begun or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e<E T="03">.,</E> a prepayment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.</P>
            <P>(2) Where NSF determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester that has a history of prompt payment.</P>
            <P>(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged fee to any agency within 30 days of the date of billing, NSF may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before NSF begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester.</P>
            <P>(4) In cases in which NSF requires advance payment or payment due under paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section, the request will not be considered perfected and further work will not be done on it until the required payment is received.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. Where records responsive to requests are maintained for distribution by agencies operating such statutorily based fee schedule programs, NSF will inform requesters of the steps for obtaining records from those sources so that they may do so most economically.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section where NSF determines, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, NSF will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.” The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
            <P>(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of information already in the public domain, in either duplicative or substantially identical form, is unlikely to contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
            <P>(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. A representative of the news media as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section will normally be presumed to satisfy this consideration.</P>

            <P>(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by <PRTPAGE P="108"/>the disclosure to a significant extent as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure. NSF will make no value judgments about whether information that would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government is “important” enough to be made public.</P>
            <P>(3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, NSF will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. NSF will consider any commercial interest of the requester (with reference to the definition of “commercial use” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters will be given an opportunity in the administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
            <P>(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether any identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is satisfied and that public interest is greater in magnitude than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. NSF ordinarily will presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
            <P>(4) Where only some of the requested records satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.</P>
            <P>(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the factors listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as they apply to each request.</P>

            <P>This part sets forth the National Science Foundation procedures under the Privacy Act of 1974. The rules in this part apply to all records in systems of records maintained by NSF that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals, as defined in the Privacy Act, may request access to records about themselves and request amendment or correction of those records. All Privacy Act requests for access to records are also processed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (as provided in part 612 of this chapter), which gives requesters the benefit of both statutes. Notice of systems of records maintained by the National Science Foundation are published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Where to make a request.</E> You may make a request for access to NSF records about yourself by appearing in person at the National Science Foundation or by making a written request. If you choose to visit the Foundation, you must contact the NSF Security Desk and ask to speak with the Foundation's Privacy Act Officer of the General Counsel. Written requests should be sent to the NSF Privacy Act Officer, National Science Foundation, <PRTPAGE P="109"/>4201 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1265, Arlington, VA 22230. Written requests are recommended, since in many cases it may take several days to determine whether a record exists, and additional time may be required for record(s) retrieval and processing.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of requested records.</E> You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable NSF personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Providing information about the purpose for which the information was collected, applicable time periods, and name or identifying number of each system of records in which you think records about you may be kept, will help speed the processing of your request. NSF publishes notices in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that describe the systems of records maintained by the Foundation. The Office of the Federal Register publishes a biennial “Privacy Act compilation” that includes NSF system notices. This compilation is available in many large reference and university libraries, and can be accessed electronically at the Government Printing Office's Web site at <E T="03">www.access.gpo/su_docs/aces/PrivacyAct.shtml.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> When requesting access to records about yourself, NSF requires that you verify your identity in an appropriate fashion. Individuals appearing in person should be prepared to show reasonable picture identification such as driver's license, government or other employment identification card, or passport. Written requests must state your full name and current address. you must sign your request and your signature must either be notarized, or submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. While no specific form is required, you may obtain information about these required elements for requests from the NSF Privacy Act Officer, Suite 1265, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230, or from the NSF Home Page under “Public &amp; media Information—FOIA and Privacy Act” at <E T="03">http://www.nsf.gov/home/pubinfo/foia.htm.</E> In order to help agency personnel in locating and identifying requested records, you may also, at your option, include your social security number, and/or date and place of birth. An individual reviewing his or her record(s) in person may be accompanied by an individual of his or her choice after signing a written statement authorizing that individual's presence. Individuals requesting or authorizing the disclosure of records to a third party must verify their identity and specifically name the third party and identify the information to be disclosed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Verification of guardianship.</E> When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, you must establish:</P>
            <P>(1) The identity of the record subject, by stating individuals' name and current address and, at your option, the social security number and/or date and place of birth of the individual;</P>
            <P>(2) Your own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) That you are the parent or guardian of that individual, which you may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing your parentage or by providing a court order establishing your guardianship; and</P>
            <P>(4) That you are acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.</P>
            <P>(e) The procedures of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall also apply to requests made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responding to requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Timing of responses to requests.</E> The Foundation will make reasonable effort to act on a request for access to records within 20 days of its receipt by the Privacy Act Officer (excluding date of receipt, weekends, and legal holidays) or from the time any required identification is received by the Privacy Act Officer, whichever is later. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Foundation will include only records in its possession as of the date of receipt. When the agency cannot complete processing of a request within 20 working days, the foundation will send a letter explaining the delay and notifying the requester <PRTPAGE P="110"/>of the date by which processing is expected to be completed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The Privacy Act Officer, or his or her designee in the office with responsibility for the requested records, is authorized to grant or deny access to a Foundation record.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Granting access to records.</E> When a determination is made to grant a request for access in whole or part, the requester will be notified as soon as possible of the Foundation's decision. Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged fee to any agency within 30 days of the date of billing, NSF may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before NSF begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Requests made in person.</E> When a request is made in person, if the records can be found, and reviewed for access without unreasonable disruption of agency operations, the Foundation may disclose the records to the requester directly upon payment of any applicable fee. A written record should be made documenting the granting of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another person, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests made in writing.</E> The Foundation will send the records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Denying access to records.</E> The requester will be notified in writing of any determination to deny a request for access to records. The notification letter will be signed by the Privacy Act Officer, or his or designee, as the individual responsible for the denial and will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied in denying the request.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Fees.</E> The Foundation will charge for duplication of records requested under the Privacy Act in the same way it charges for duplication under the Freedom of Information Act (see CFR 612.10). No search or review fee may be charged for the record unless the record has been exempted from access under Exemptions (j)(2) or (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Amendment of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Where to make a request.</E> An individual may request amendment of records pertaining to him or her that are maintained in an NSF Privacy Act system of records, except that certain records described in paragraph (h) of this section are exempt from amendment. Request for amendment of records must be made in writing to the NSF Privacy Act Officer, National Science Foundation, Suite 1265, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">How to make a request.</E> Your request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment you want to take place and specify why you believe that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. You may submit any documentation that you think would be helpful. Providing an edited copy of the record(s) showing the desired change will assist the agency in making a determination about your request. If you believe that the same information is maintained in more than one NSF system of records you should include that information in your request. You must sign your request and provide verification of your identity as specified in 613.2(c).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing of responses to requests.</E> The Privacy Act Officer, or his or her designee, will acknowledge receipt of request for amendment within 10 working days of receipt. Upon receipt of a proper request the Privacy Act Officer will promptly confer with the NSF Directorate or Office with responsibility for the record to determine if the request should be granted in whole or part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Granting request for amendment.</E> When a determination is made to grant a request for amendment in whole or part, notification to the requester will be made as soon as possible, normally within 30 wording days of the Privacy Act Officer receiving the request, describing the amendment made and including a copy of the amended record, in disclosable form.<PRTPAGE P="111"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Denying request for amendment.</E> When a determination is made that amendment, in whole or part, is unwarranted, the matter shall be brought to the attention of the Inspector General, if it pertains to records maintained by the Office of the Inspector General, or to the attention of the General Counsel, if it pertains to other NSF records. If the General Counsel or Inspector General or their designee agrees with the determination that amendment is not warranted, the Privacy Act Officer will notify the requester in writing, normally within 30 working days of the Privacy Act Officer receiving the request. The notification letter will be signed by the Privacy Act Officer or his or her designee, and will include a statement of the reason(s) for the denial and how to appeal the decision.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Appealing a denial.</E> You may appeal a denial of a request to amend records to the General Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1265, Arlington, VA 22230. You must make your appeal in writing and it must be received by the Office of the General Counsel within ten days of the receipt of the denial (weekends, legal holidays, and the date of receipt excluded). Clearly mark your appeal letter and envelope “Privacy Act Appeal.” Your appeal letter must include a copy of your original request for amendment and the denial letter, along with any additional documentation or argument you wish to submit in favor of amending the records. It must be signed by you or your officially designated representative.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> The General Counsel, or his or her designee, will normally render a decision on the appeal within thirty working days after proper receipt of the written appeal by the General Counsel. If additional time to make a determination is necessary you will be advised in writing of the need for an extension.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Amendment appeal granted.</E> If on appeal the General Counsel, or his or her designee, determines that amendment of the record should take place, you will be notified as soon as possible of the Foundation's decision. The notification will describe the amendment made and include a copy of the amended record, in disclosable form.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Amendment appeal denied—Statement of disagreement.</E> If on appeal the General Counsel, or his or her designee, upholds a denial of a request for amendment of records, you will be notified in writing of the reasons why the appeal was denied and advised of your right to seek judicial review of the decision. The letter will also notify you of your right to file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for your disagreement with the refusal of the Foundation to amend the record. The statement should be sent to the Privacy Act Officer, who will ensure that a copy of the statement is placed with the disputed record. A copy of the statement will be included with any subsequent disclosure of the record.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Records not subject to amendment.</E> The following records are not subject to amendment:</P>
            <P>(1) Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements made under oath;</P>

            <P>(a) The National Science Board may by record vote close any portion of any meeting if it properly determines that an open meeting:</P>
            <P>(1) Is likely to disclose matters that (i) are specifically authorized under criteria established by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) are in fact properly classified pursuant to the Executive Order;</P>
            <P>(2) Is likely to relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the National Science Foundation;</P>

            <P>(3) Is likely to disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by <PRTPAGE P="113"/>statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the statute (i) requires in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue that the matters be withheld from the public, or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
            <P>(4) Is likely to disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(5) Is likely to involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;</P>
            <P>(6) Is likely to disclose personal information where the disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(7) Is likely to disclose investigatory law-enforcement records, or information which, if written, would be contained in such records, but only to the extent provided in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(7);</P>
            <P>(8) Is likely to disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;</P>
            <P>(9) Is likely to disclose information, the premature disclosure of which would:</P>
            <P>(i) In the case of information received from an agency which regulates currencies, securities, commodities, or financial institutions, be likely to (A) lead to significant financial speculation in currencies, securities, or commodities, or (B) significantly endanger the stability of any financial institution; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed Foundation action, unless the Foundation has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action or is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative before taking final action; or</P>
            <P>(10) Is likely to specifically concern the Foundation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration.</P>
            <P>(b) Anyone who believes his interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting may request that the Board close it to the public for any reason referred to in paragraph (a) (5), (6), or (7) of this section. The request should be addressed to the Executive Officer, National Science Board, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230. It will be circulated to Members of the Board if received at least three full days before the meeting, and on motion of any Member the Board will determine by record vote whether to close the affected portion of the meeting.</P>

However, the results of any such review shall not constitute a basis for NSF refusal to grant financial assistance to the applicant under that program or activity unless the procedural requirements of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6104) and §§ 617.12 and 617.13 of this part have been followed.</P>

If an insufficient complaint is amended within 10 working days after notice by NSF to the complainant of the deficiency, NSF will consider the amended complaint as filed on the date the original insufficient complaint was filed for purposes <PRTPAGE P="119"/>of determining if it was timely filed. However, all other time requirements established by the Act and this part shall run from the date the amended complaint was filed.</P>
            <P>(c) On receipt of any complaint NSF shall promptly send written acknowledgement to the complainant, and a copy of the complaint to the recipient. In addition, NSF shall send either copies of this part or other pertinent information describing the rights and obligations of the parties.</P>
            <P>(d) NSF will return to the complainant any complaint outside the coverage of this part, and will state why it is outside the coverage of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) NSF will refer to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service all complaints that fall within the jurisdiction of this part and contain all information necessary for further processing.</P>
            <P>(b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or for a mediator to make an informed judgement that an agreement is not possible.

            <P>(c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and recipient sign it.

            <P>(2) As part of the initial investigation, NSF will use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and recipient, to establish the facts, and, if possible, will settle the complaint on terms that are agreeable to the parties. NSF may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.</P>
            <P>(3) NSF will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official of NSF.</P>
            <P>(4) A settlement shall not affect other enforcement efforts of NSF, including compliance reviews, or individual complaints that involve the recipient.</P>
            <P>(5) A settlement is not a finding of discrimination against the recipient.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Formal investigation.</E> If NSF cannot resolve the complaint through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of the Act, NSF will try to obtain voluntary compliance. If NSF cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin enforcement as described in § 617.12. If the investigation does not indicate a violation of the Act, NSF will issue a written determination in favor of the recipient.</P>

            <P>(a) NSF may enforce this part by either termination of a recipient's financial asistance from NSF for the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or this part or refusal to grant further financial assistance under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or this part. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. Therefore, cases settled in the mediation process or before a hearing will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from NSF.</P>
            <P>(b) NSF may also enforce this part by any other means authorized by law, including but not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations by this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this part.</P>
            <P>(c) NSF will limit any termination or refusal to grant further financial assistance to the particular recipient and the particular program or activity found to be in violation of the Act. NSF will not base any part of a termination or refusal on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance for NSF.</P>
            <P>(d) NSF will not begin any hearing under paragraph (a) until the Director has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with this part and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.</P>
            <P>(e) NSF will not terminate or refuse to grant financial assistance until thirty days have elapsed after the Director has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Director will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) Subject to § 618.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Separate teams.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Equal opportunity.</E> (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;</P>
              <P>(ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;</P>
              <P>(iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;</P>

              <P>(v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;</P>
              <P>(vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;</P>
              <P>(vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive facilities;</P>

              <P>(x) Publicity.</P>

              <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but <PRTPAGE P="135"/>the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustment period.</E> A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.</P>

              <P>There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:</P>
              <P>(a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 630.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—</P>
              <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
              <P>(2) Include the employee's position title;</P>

              <P>(5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.</P>
              <P>(b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either—</P>
              <P>(1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or</P>
              <P>(2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>

              <P>(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each National Science Foundation award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—</P>
              <P>(1) To the National Science Foundation official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or</P>
              <P>(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by National Science Foundation officials or their designated representatives.</P>

              <P>(b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Actions requiring an environmental assessment and categorical exclusions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The types of actions to be classified as “major Federal actions” subject to NEPA procedures are discussed generally in the CEQ regulations. Paragraph (b) of this section describes various classes of NSF actions that normally require the preparation of an environmental assessment or an EIS, and those classes that are categorically excluded. (Categorical exclusion is defined at 40 CFR 1508.4.) The word “normally” is stressed; there may be individual cases in which specific factors require contrary action. NSF directorates and offices are responsible for identifying situations in which an environmental assessment or an EIS should be prepared even if not normally required by paragraph (b) of this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(b) Most NSF awards support individual scientific research projects and are not “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” except in the sense that the long term effect of the accumulation of human knowledge is likely to affect the quality of the human environment. However, such long term effects are basically speculative and unknowable in advance; thus they normally do not provide a sufficient basis for classifying research as subject to NEPA (See 40 CFR 1508.8) and are categorically excluded from an environmental assessment. Nevertheless, in some cases the actual procedures used in carrying out the research may have potential environmental effects, particularly where the project requires construction of facilities or major disturbance of the local environment brought about by blasting, drilling, excavating, or other means. Accordingly, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following types of activities require at least an environmental assessment:</P>
            <P>(1) Cases where developmental efforts are supported, if the project supports the transition of a particular technology from the development stage to large-scale commercial utilization.</P>
            <P>(2) Any project supporting construction, other than interior remodelling.</P>
            <P>(3) Cases where field work affecting the natural environment will be conducted.</P>
            <P>(4) Any project that will involve drilling of the earth, excavation, explosives, weather modification, or other techniques that may alter a local environment.</P>
            <P>(5) Any project that provides for the testing and release of biological-control agents for purposes of ecosystem manipulation and assessment of short- and long-term effects of major ecosystem perturbation.</P>

            <P>(c) Directorates having divisions or programs with a substantial number of projects that fall within categories (3), (4), and (5) in (b) of this section, are authorized to issue supplemental guidelines to Division Directors and Program Officers establishing subcategories of research methodologies or techniques for which environmental assessments need not be prepared. For example, if a program regularly supports research that involves noninvasive techniques or nonharmful invasive techniques (such as taking water or soil samples, or collecting non-protected species of flora and fauna) the directorate may determine that field projects otherwise coming under paragraph (b)(3) of this section <PRTPAGE P="145"/>which involve only the use of such techniques do not require an environmental assessment. However, any such guidelines must be submitted to the Chairman for approval.</P>
            <P>(d) In some cases within the categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section, it will be evident at the outset or after the assessment process is begun that an EIS should be prepared. In such cases an assessment need not be completed, but the process of preparing an EIS (See § 640.5, of this part) should be started.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibilities and procedures for preparation of an environmental assessment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Program Officers, as the first point of decision in the review process, shall determine into which category incoming proposals fall, according to the criteria set forth in § 640.3 of this part. Notwithstanding this responsibility of the Program Officer, the appropriate Division Director, Assistant Director, and other reviewing policy officials must assure that adequate analysis is being made.</P>
            <P>(b) Where appropriate, programs, divisions, or directorates will advise prospective applicants in program announcements, requests for proposals, and other NSF-prepared brochures of the requirement to furnish information regarding any environmental impact that the applicant's proposed study may have.</P>
            <P>(c) Should an environmental assessment be required, the directorate supporting the activity shall be responsible for its preparation. The grant or contract applicant may be asked to submit additional information in order that a reasonable and accurate assessment may be made. Though no specific format for an environmental assessment is prescribed, it shall be a separate document suitable for public review and shall serve the purpose described in 40 CFR 1508.9, which is quoted in full as follows:</P>

              <P>“Environmental Assessment”:</P>
              <P>(a) Means a concise public document for which a Federal agency is responsible that serves to:</P>
              <P>(1) Briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.</P>
              <P>(2) Aid an agency's compliance with the Act when no environmental impact statement is necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) Facilitate preparation of a statement when one is necessary.</P>
              <P>(b) Shall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E), of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.</P>

            <P>(e) If, on the basis of an environmental assessment, it is determined that an EIS is not required, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) as described in 40 CFR 1508.13 will be prepared. The FNSI shall include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and be available to the public from the Committee. If the proposed action is one that normally requires an EIS, is closely similar to an action normally requiring an EIS, or is without precedent, the FNSI shall be made available for a 30 day public review period before any action is taken.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibilities and procedures for preparation of an environmental impact statement.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If initially or after an environmental assessment has been completed, it is determined that an environmental impact statement should be prepared, it and other related documentation will be prepared by the directorate responsible for the action in accordance with section 102(2)(c) of the Act, this part, and the CEQ regulations. The responsible directorate will be in close communication with the grant or contract applicant and may have to rely extensively on his or her input in preparing the EIS. However, once a document is prepared it shall be submitted to the Chairman who, after such review <PRTPAGE P="146"/>by the Committee as is deemed necessary by the Chairman, shall transmit the document as required by CEQ regulations and this part. If the Chairman considers a document unsatisfactory, he or she shall return it to the responsible directorate for revision prior to an award decision.</P>
            <P>Specifically, the following steps, as discussed in the CEQ regulations, will be followed in preparing an EIS:</P>
            <P>(1) A notice of intent to prepare a draft EIS will be published as described in 40 CFR 1501.7.</P>
            <P>(2) Scoping, as described in 40 CFR 1501.7, will be conducted.</P>
            <P>(3) The format and contents of the draft and final EIS shall be as discussed in 40 CFR part 1502.</P>
            <P>(4) Comments on the draft EIS shall be invited as set forth in 40 CFR 1503.1. The minimum period to be afforded for comments on a draft EIS shall be 45 days, unless a lesser period is necessary to comply with other specific statutory requirements or in case of emergency circumstances, as described in 40 CFR 1506.11.</P>
            <P>(5) The requirements of 40 CFR 1506.9 for filing of documents with the Environmental Protection Agency shall be followed.</P>
            <P>(6) The responsible directorate shall examine carefully the basis on which supportive studies have been conducted to assure that such studies are objective and comprehensive in scope and in depth.</P>
            <P>(7) The Act requires that the decisionmaking involved “utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that will insure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts.” If such disciplines are not present on the NSF staff, appropriate use should be made of personnel of Federal, State, and local agencies, universities, non-profit organizations, or private industry.</P>
            <P>(8) A copy of the draft EIS or the final EIS (or a summary, if the size of the EIS does not make this practical) shall be included in and accompany the appropriate proposal throughout the NSF internal review and approval process.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) 40 CFR 1506.1 describes the types of actions that should not be taken during the NEPA process. Such actions shall be avoided by NSF personnel during the process of preparation of an EIS and for a period of thirty days after the final EIS is filed with EPA, unless such actions are necessary to comply with other specific statutory requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) 40 CFR 1506.10 also places certain limitations on the timing of agency decisions on taking “major Federal actions”. In some cases the actual “decision point” may be more clear-cut than others. If the “action” that necessitated the preparation of an EIS is one that would be carried out under grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, then the award shall not be made before the times set forth in 40 CFR 1506.10, unless such action is necessary to comply with other specific statutory requirements, or as exceptions are needed as provided in 40 CFR 1506.10, 1506.11, or 1507.3. However, an award for preliminary planning proposals may be made before such times if it is so structured as to require further NSF approvals for funding the actual actions that might adversely affect the quality of the human environment. In such cases, the subsequent approvals for funding these actions will be considered the “decision”. This is consistent with the requirement that environmental considerations undergo concurrent review with all other project planning considerations.</P>
            <P>(c) In appropriate cases, if the action involves other agencies, the Chairman may agree to designate another agency as “lead agency” and to cooperate as discussed in 40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6. In such cases, the Chairman has authority to alter the procedures described in (a) to the extent they are inconsistent with functions assigned to NSF under the “cooperating agency” arrangements.</P>

            <P>(d) A public record of decision stating what the decision was; identifying alternatives that were considered, including the environmentally preferable one(s); discussing any national policy considerations that entered into the decision; and summarizing a monitoring and enforcement program if applicable for mitigation, will be prepared. This record of decision will be prepared at the time the decision is <PRTPAGE P="147"/>made, or if appropriate, when the agency makes its recommendation for action to Congress. (See 40 CFR 1505.2.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preliminary environmental review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The responsible official shall be notified early in the general planning process of actions proposed by USAP components that may have impacts on the Antarctic environment, so that environmental review may be integrated into the planning and decisionmaking processes. The responsible official shall conduct a preliminary environmental review of each action, including consideration of the potential direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect effects of a proposed action on the Antarctic environment.</P>
            <P>(b) If, on the basis of the preliminary environmental review, the responsible official determines that an action will have less than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, he will prepare an Environmental Action Memorandum briefly summarizing the environmental issues considered and conclusions drawn from the review.

            <SUBJECT>Preparation of environmental documents, generally.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Preparation of an environmental document.</E> If the responsible official determines, either initially or on the basis of a preliminary environmental review, that a proposed action may have at least a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, he will prepare an environmental document in accordance with the provisions of this part. In making this determination, the responsible official should consider whether and to what degree the proposed action:</P>
            <P>(1) Has the potential to adversely affect the Antarctic environment;</P>
            <P>(2) May adversely affect climate and weather patterns;</P>
            <P>(3) May adversely affect air or water quality;</P>
            <P>(4) May affect atmospheric, terrestrial (including aquatic), glacial or marine environments;</P>
            <P>(5) May detrimentally affect the distribution, abundance or productivity or species, or populations of species of fauna and flora;</P>

            <P>(6) May further jeopardize endangered or threatened species or populations of such species;<PRTPAGE P="149"/>
            </P>
            <P>(7) May degrade, or pose substantial risk to, areas of biological, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness significance;</P>
            <P>(8) Has highly uncertain environmental effects, or involves unique or unknown environmental risks; or</P>
            <P>(9) Together with other actions, the effects of any one of which is individually insignificant, may have at least minor or transitory cumulative environmental effects.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Prior assessments.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions of § 641.16(a), if (1) An environmental document (including a generic or programmatic CEE) or its equivalent has been prepared for a particular type of action; (2) That document includes an analysis of potential environmental effects that are directly relevant to the potential effects of the proposed action, taking in account factors such as the similarity of the actions and of the locations within which they take place; and (3) There are no potential site specific or other impacts that would require further evaluation, then a new environmental document need not be prepared. Instead, the responsible official shall prepare an Environmental Action Memorandum for the proposed action, cross-referencing the previously prepared environmental document.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> NSF has determined that the following actions will have less than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, and are not subject to the procedures set forth in this part, except to the extent provided herein:</P>
            <P>(1) Scientific research activities involving:</P>
            <P>(i) Low volume collection of biological or geologic specimens, provided no more mammals or birds are taken than can normally be replaced by natural reproduction in the following season;</P>
            <P>(ii) Small-scale detonation of explosives in connection with seismic research conducted in the continental interior or Antarctica where there will be no potential for impact on native flora and fauna;</P>
            <P>(iii) Use of weather/research balloons, research rockets, and automatic weather stations that are to be retrieved; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Use of radioisotopes, provided such use complies with applicable laws and regulations, and with NSF procedures for handling and disposing of radioisotopes.</P>
            <P>(2) Interior remodelling and renovation of existing facilities.</P>
            <FP>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if information developed during the planning of any of the actions described in this paragraph (c) indicates the possibility that the action may have at least a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, the environmental effects of the action shall be reviewed to determine the need for the preparation of an environmental document.</FP>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordination with other committees, offices and federal agencies.</E> The responsible official shall notify NSF's Committee of Environmental Matters when he intends to prepare an environmental document, and will coordinate preparation of the document with those entities. Responsibility for preparation of the environmental document rests primarily with the responsible official, but, as soon as is feasible, he should consult with and encourage the participation of other knowledgeable individuals within NSF, and, where appropriate, with other individuals, government agencies and entities with relevant knowledge and expertise.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Type of environmental document.</E> The type of environmental document required under this part depends on the nature of the proposed action under consideration. An IEE must be prepared for proposed actions which the responsible official concludes may have at least a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment and for which a CEE is not prepared. A CEE must be prepared if an IEE indicates, or if it is otherwise determined, that a proposed action is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Obligation of funds.</E> Because of logistic constraints (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> constraints due to transportation difficulties, inaccessibility of Antarctic bases for much of the year, and the need to obtain items or materials requiring long lead times), it may not be possible to complete the environmental review of a proposed action before funds must be committed <PRTPAGE P="150"/>and/or disbursed. In such cases, funds for the proposed action may be committed and/or disbursed, provided:</P>
            <P>(1) The appropriate environmental review is completed before implementation of the proposed action in Antarctica, and</P>
            <P>(2) Implementation plans for the proposed action will be modified or canceled, if appropriate, in light of the completed environmental review (including public comments, if applicable).</P>

            <SUBJECT>National Science Foundation patent policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>As authorized by the National Science Board at its 230th meeting, October 15-16, 1981, the Director of the National Science Foundation has adopted the following statement of NSF patent policy.</P>
            <P>(a) In accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act and the Presidential Memorandum entitled “Government Patent Policy” issued February 18, 1983, the Foundation will use the Patent Rights clause prescribed by the Department of Commerce in all its funding agreements for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work, including awards made to foreign entities, unless the Foundation determines that some other provision would better serve the purposes of that Act or the interests of the United States and the general public.</P>
            <P>(b) In funding agreements covered by a treaty or agreement that provides that an international organization or foreign government, research institute, or inventor will own or share patent rights, the Foundation will acquire such patent rights as are necessary to comply with the applicable treaty or agreement.</P>
            <P>(c) If an awardee elects not to retain rights to an invention, the Foundation will allow the inventor to retain the principal patent rights unless the awardee, or the inventor's employer if other than the awardee, shows that it would be harmed by that action.</P>

            <P>(d) The Foundation will normally allow any patent rights not wanted by the awardee or inventor to be dedicated to the public through publication in scientific journals or as a statutory invention registration. However, if another Federal agency is known to be interested in the relevant technology, the Foundation may give it an opportunity to review and patent the invention so long as that does not inhibit <PRTPAGE P="153"/>the dissemination of the research results to the scientific community.</P>

            <P>(a) 35 U.S.C. 200-212, commonly called the Bayh-Dole Act, as amended by title V of Public Law 98-620 (98 stat. 3335, 3364). That law controls the allocation of rights to inventions made by employees of small business firms and domestic nonprofit organizations, including universities, during federally-supported experimentation, research, or development. Government-wide implementing regulations are contained in part 401 of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) Section 11(e) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 1870(e)) provides that the Foundation shall have the authority to do all things necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, including, but without being limited thereto, the authority—to acquire by purchase, lease, loan, gift, or condemnation, and to hold and dispose of by grant, sale, lease, or loan, real and personal property of all kinds necessary for, or resulting from, the exercise of authority granted by this Act.</P>
            <P>(c) Section 12 of the NSF Act (42 U.S.C. 1871) provides that each contract or other arrangement executed pursuant to this Act which relates to scientific research shall contain provisions governing the disposition of inventions produced thereunder in a manner calculated to protect the public interest and the equities of the individual or organization with which the contract or other arrangement is executed.</P>
            <P>(d) The Presidential Memorandum entitled “Government Patent Policy” issued February 18, 1983, directs Federal agencies, to the extent permitted by law, to apply to all research performers the policies of the Bayh-Dole Act. Under the provisions of the National Science Foundation Act quoted above, the Foundation is permitted to apply the Bayh-Dole policies without restriction.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Patent Rights (August, 2005)</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Invention</E> means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States Code, to any novel variety of plant which is or may be protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Subject invention</E> means any invention of the grantee conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under this grant, provided that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of grant performance.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Practical application</E> means to manufacture in the case of a composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method, or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations available to the public on reasonable terms.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Made</E> when used in relation to any invention means the conception or first actual reduction to practice of such invention.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Small business firm</E> means a domestic small business concern as defined at section 2 of Public Law 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the purpose of this Patents Rights clause, the size standard for small business concerns involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Nonprofit organization</E> means a domestic university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any domestic nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a State nonprofit organization statute.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Allocation of Principal Rights.</E> The grantee may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this Patents Rights clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the grantee retains title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world. If the award indicates it is <PRTPAGE P="154"/>subject to an identified international agreement or treaty, the National Science Foundation (NSF) also has the right to direct the grantee to convey to any foreign participant such patent rights to subject inventions as are required to comply with that agreement or treaty.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent Applications by Grantee.</E> (1) The grantee will disclose each subject invention to NSF within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to grantee personnel responsible for the administration of patent matters. The disclosure to NSF will be submitted via the iEdison Invention Information Management System maintained by the National Institutes of Health and shall identify the grant under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the nature, purpose, operation, and, to the extent known, the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to NSF, the grantee will promptly notify NSF of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the grantee.</P>
              <P>(2) The grantee will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying NSF within two years of disclosure to NSF. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the one year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by NSF to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.</P>
              <P>(3) The grantee will file its initial patent application on an invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The grantee will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent application, or six months from the date when permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications when such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.</P>
              <P>(4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to NSF, election, and filing under subparagraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of NSF, be granted.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title.</E> The grantee will convey to NSF, upon written request, title to any subject invention:</P>
              <P>(1) If the grantee fails to disclose or elect the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) above, or elects not to retain title; provided that NSF may only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the grantee to disclose or elect within the specified times.</P>
              <P>(2) In those countries in which the grantee fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) above; provided, however, that if the grantee has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) above, but prior to its receipt of the written request of NSF, the grantee shall continue to retain title in that country.</P>
              <P>(3) In any country in which the grantee decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Minimum Rights to Grantee.</E> (1) The grantee will retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the grantee fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) above. The grantee's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the grantee is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the grantee was legally obligated to do so at the time the grant was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of NSF except when transferred to the successor of that part of the grantee's business to which the invention pertains.</P>
              <P>(2) The grantee's domestic license may be revoked or modified by NSF to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the grantee has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of NSF to the extent the grantee, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.</P>

              <P>(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, NSF will furnish the grantee a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the grantee will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may <PRTPAGE P="155"/>be authorized by NSF for good cause shown by the grantee) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The grantee has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Grantee Action to Protect Government's Interest.</E> (1) The grantee agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to NSF all instruments necessary to:</P>
              <P>(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions for which the grantee retains title, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Convey title to NSF when requested under paragraph (d) above, and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.</P>
              <P>(2) The grantee agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and non-technical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the grantee each subject invention made under this grant in order that the grantee can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) above, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, at a minimum, the information requested by paragraph (c)(1) above. The grantee shall instruct such employees through the employee agreements or other suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</P>
              <P>(3) The grantee will notify NSF of any decision not to continue prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than thirty days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.</P>
              <P>(4) The grantee agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement: “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the grant) awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this invention.”</P>
              <P>(5) The grantee or its representative will complete, execute, and submit electronically to NSF via the iEdison Invention Information Management System maintained by the National Institutes of Health a confirmation of a License to the United States Government and the page of a United States patent application that contains the Federal support clause within two months of filing any domestic or foreign patent application.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> (1) The grantee will include this Patents Rights clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the grantee in this Patents Rights clause, and the grantee will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, when the prime award by the Foundation was a contract (but not a grant or cooperative agreement), NSF, subcontractor, and contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this Patents Rights clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Foundation with respect to those matters covered by this Patents Rights clause.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions.</E> The grantee agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the grantee or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the grantee, and such other data and information as NSF may reasonably specify. The grantee also agrees to provide additional reports in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by NSF in accordance with paragraph (j) of this Patents Rights clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), NSF agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without the permission of the grantee.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Preference for United States Industry.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Patents Rights clause, the grantee agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by NSF upon a showing by the grantee or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">March-in Rights.</E> The grantee agrees that with respect to any subject invention in <PRTPAGE P="156"/>which it has acquired title, NSF has the right in accordance with procedures at 37 CFR 401.6 and NSF regulations at 45 CFR 650.13 to require the grantee, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the grantee, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, NSF has the right to grant such a license itself if NSF determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) Such action is necessary because the grantee or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;</P>
              <P>(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the grantee, assignee, or their licensees;</P>
              <P>(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the grantee, assignee, or licensee; or</P>
              <P>(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this Patents Rights clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Special Provisions for Grants with Nonprofit Organizations.</E> If the grantee is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:</P>
              <P>(1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of NSF, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the grantee;</P>
              <P>(2) The grantee will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when NSF deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</P>
              <P>(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the grantee with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and</P>
              <P>(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms and that it will give preference to a small business firm if the grantee determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided that the grantee is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out it plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the grantee. However, the grantee agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the grantee's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the grantee will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary when the Secretary's review discloses that the grantee could take reasonable steps to implement more effectively the requirements of this paragraph (k)(4).</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Communications.</E> All communications required by this Patents Rights clause must be submitted through the iEdison Invention Information Management System maintained by the National Institutes of Health unless prior permission for another form of submission is obtained from the Patent Assistant at <E T="03">patents@nsf.gov</E> or at Office of the General Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230.</P>

            <P>At the request of the prospective awardee or on recommendation from NSF staff, a Grants or Contracts Officer, with the concurrence of the cognizant Program Manager, may negotiate special patent provisions when he or she determines that exceptional circumstances require restriction or elimination of the right of a prospective awardee to retain title to any subject invention in order to better promote the policy and objectives of chapter 18 of title 35 of the United States Code or the National Science Foundation Act. The Grants or Contracts Officer will prepare the written determination required by § 401.3(e) of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations and assure that appropriate reports are made to the Secretary of Commerce <PRTPAGE P="157"/>and Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration as required in § 401.3(f). Unless doing so would be inconsistent with an obligation imposed on the Foundation by statute, international agreement, or pact with other participants in or supporters of the research, every special patent provision will allow the awardee, after an invention has been made, to request that it be allowed to retain principal rights to that invention under § 650.12(e) of this regulation.</P>

              <P>The National Science Foundation claims no rights to any inventions or writings that might result from its fellowship or traineeship awards. However, fellows and trainees should be aware that the NSF, another Federal agency, or some private party may acquire such rights through other support for particular research.

            <P>(a) Some NSF awards are made as part of international cooperative research programs. The agreements or treaties underlying many of these programs require an allocation of patent rights different from that provided by the Patent Rights clause in § 650.4(a). Therefore, as permitted by § 401.5(d) of the implementing regulations for the Bayh-Dole Act (37 CFR 401.5(d)), paragraph (b) of the standard Patent Rights clause in § 650.4(a) has been modified to provide that the Foundation may require the grantee to transfer to a foreign government or research performer such rights in any subject invention as are contemplated in the international agreement. The award instrument will identify the applicable agreement or treaty.</P>
            <P>(b) After an invention is disclosed to the Patent Assistant, the recipient of an award subject to an international agreement will be informed as to what rights, if any, it must transfer to foreign participants. Recipients may also ask the Program Manager to provide them with copies of the identified international agreements before or after accepting an award.</P>

            <P>If an awardee elects not to retain rights to an invention, the inventor may request the NSF Patent Assistant for permission to retain principal patent rights. Such requests should be made as soon as possible after the awardee notifies the Patent Assistant that it does not want to patent the invention. Such requests will normally be granted unless either the awardee or the employer of the inventor shows that it would be harmed by that action. As required by § 401.9 of the implementing regulations for the Bayh-Dole Act (37 CFR 401.9), the inventor will be subject to the same conditions that the awardee would have been, except that the special restrictions imposed on nonprofit organizations will not apply to the inventor.</P>

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the NSF Patent Assistant will acknowledge a negative election by encouraging the awardee and inventor to promptly make all research results available to the scientific and engineering community.</P>

            <P>(b) If the NSF Patent Assistant believes that another Federal agency is <PRTPAGE P="158"/>interested in the relevant technology, he or she may, after receiving the awardee's election not to patent and ascertaining that the inventor also does not want to patent, send a copy of the invention disclosure to that agency to give it an opportunity to review and patent the invention. Unless the agency expresses an interest in the invention within thirty days, the Patent Assistant will acknowledge the awardee's negative election by encouraging prompt publication of all research results. If the agency does express an interest in patenting the invention, the Patent Assistant will transfer to it all rights to the invention.</P>

Whenever the NSF Patent Assistant finds that another agency also supported an NSF subject invention, he or she will consult with the grantee or contractor and appropriate personnel in the other agency to determine if a single agency should be designated to administer the Government's rights in the invention.

            <P>(c) Approval of long-term exclusive licensing of NSF-assisted inventions by nonprofit organizations (restricted by earlier versions of the NSF Patents Rights clause and by pre-Bayh-Dole Institutional Patent Agreements and waiver conditions) will be given by the Patent Assistant unless he or she determines that the interests of the United States Government will be adversely affected by such waiver.</P>
            <P>(d) The preference for United States industry imposed by paragraph (i) of the Patent Rights clause in § 650.4(a) may be waived by the NSF Patent Assistant as provided in that paragraph.</P>
            <P>(e) Special restrictions on or limitation of the right of an awardee to retain title to subject inventions imposed under § 650.5 of this regulation may be waived by the Grants or Contracting Officer whenever he or she determines, after consultation with the cognizant Program Manager, that the reasons for imposing the restrictions or limitations do not require their application to a particular invention.</P>

            <P>(f) Requests for approvals and waiver under this section should be addressed to the NSF Patent Assistant as provided in paragraph (1) of the Patent Rights clause in § 650.4(a). Requests under paragraph (a) of this section for extensions of time to disclose, elect, or <PRTPAGE P="159"/>file may be made by telephone or electronic mail as well as in writing. A written request for extension of time to disclose, elect, or file can be assumed to have been approved unless the Patent Assistant replies negatively within ten business days of the date such request was mailed, telecopied, or otherwise dispatched. Requests for approvals or waivers under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section must be in writing and should explain why an approval or waiver is justified under the stated criteria. The requester will be given a written explanation of the reasons for denial of a request covered by this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exercise of march-in rights.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The procedures established by this section supplement those prescribed by § 401.6 of the implementing regulation for the Bayh-Dole Act (37 CFR § 401.6) and apply to all march-in rights held by NSF including those resulting from funding agreements not covered by the Bayh-Dole Act.</P>
            <P>(b) Petitions requesting that the NSF exercise a march-in right should be addressed to the NSF Patent Assistant. Such petitions should:</P>
            <P>(1) Identify the patent or patent application involved and the relevant fields of use of the invention;</P>
            <P>(2) State the grounds for the proposed march-in;</P>
            <P>(3) Supply evidence that one or more of the four conditions creating a march-in right (lack of practical application, unsatisfied health or safety needs, unmet requirements for public use, or failure to prefer United States industry) is present; and</P>
            <P>(4) Explain what action by the Foundation is necessary to correct that condition.</P>
            <P>(c) If evidence received from a petitioner or from the Foundation's administration of the Patent Rights clause indicates that one or more of the four conditions creating a march-in right might exist, the NSF Patent Assistant will informally review the matter as provided in § 401.6(b) of the implementing regulation. If that informal review indicates that one or more of the four conditions creating a march-in right probably exists, the Patent Assistant will initiate a formal march-in proceeding by issuing a written notice to the patent holder. That notice will provide all the information required by § 401.6(c) of the implementing regulation. The patent holder may submit information and argument in opposition to the proposed march-in in person, in writing, or through a representative.</P>
            <P>(d) If the NSF Patent Assistant determines that a genuine dispute over material facts exists, he or she will identify the disputed facts and notify the NSF General Counsel. The General Counsel will create a cross-directorate fact-finding panel, which will establish its own fact-finding procedures within the requirements of § 401.6(e) of the implementing regulation based on the dimensions of the particular dispute. The Patent Assistant will serve as secretary to the panel, but will not take part in its deliberations. Written findings of facts will be submitted to the General Counsel, sent by certified mail to the patent holder, and made available to all other interested parties.</P>
            <P>(e) The NSF General Counsel will determine whether and how the Foundation should exercise a march-in right as provided in § 401.6(g) of the implementing regulation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for conveyance of title to NSF.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The procedures established by this section apply to the exercise of the Foundation's right under paragraph (d) of the Patent Rights clause in § 650.4(a) to request conveyance of title to a subject invention if certain conditions exist.</P>
            <P>(b) The NSF Patent Assistant may request the recipient of an NSF award to convey to the Foundation or a designee title in one or more countries to any invention to which the awardee has elected not to retain title. The NSF Patent Assistant may request immediate conveyance of title to a subject invention if the awardee fails (1) to submit a timely invention disclosure, (2) to make a timely election to retain patent rights, or (3) to file a timely patent application; but only if he or she determines that such action is required to preserve patent rights.</P>

            <P>(c) The NSF Patent Assistant will informally review any apparent failure <PRTPAGE P="160"/>by an awardee to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of the Patent Rights clause in § 650.4(a). The interested institution, the inventor, the patent holder, and any other interested party will be given an opportunity to explain why a particular invention was not disclosed, why an election was not made, or why a patent application was not filed. If the Patent Assistant determines that a genuine dispute over material facts exists, a cross-directorate fact-finding panel will be appointed by the General Counsel. The panel will establish its own fact-finding procedures based on the dimensions of the particular dispute. Written findings of facts will be submitted to the General Counsel, sent by certified mail to the patent holder, and made available to all other interested parties.</P>
            <P>(d) The NSF General Counsel will determine whether the Foundation should request conveyance of title or if it should retain title obtained under § 650.14(b).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 650.15</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All actions by the NSF Patent Assistant under § 650.8 denying an inventor's request to retain rights to a subject invention, under § 650.12 denying a request for waiver, or under § 650.14(d) denying the existence of a material dispute may be appealed to the Director of the NSF Division of Grants and Contracts by an affected party within thirty days. A request under § 650.14(b) to immediately convey title to the Foundation may be appealed to the DGC Director by the title holder within five days.</P>
            <P>(b) All actions by a Grants and Agreements Officer or Contracting Officer refusing to eliminate restrictions on or limitation of the right of an awardee to retain title to subject inventions imposed under § 650.5 of this regulation may be appealed to the Director of the NSF Division of Contracts, Policy, and Oversight (CPO) by an affected party within thirty days.</P>
            <P>(c) A decision by the General Counsel to exercise a march-in right or to request conveyance of title may be appealed by the patent holder or any affected licensee to the NSF Deputy Director within thirty days. When a march-in was initiated in response to a petition, the General Counsel's decision not to exercise a march-in right or to exercise it in a manner different from that requested in the petition may be appealed by the petitioner to the NSF Deputy Director within thirty days.</P>
            <P>(d) In reviewing the actions of the NSF Patent Assistant, a Grants and Agreements Officer, a Contracting Officer, or the General Counsel, the CPO Director or NSF Deputy Director will consider both the factual and legal basis for the action or determination and its consistency with the policies and objectives of the Foundation and, if applicable, the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. 200-212) and implementing regulations at part 401 of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

            <P>The Foundation will acquire rights to a research performer's pre-existing technology only in exceptional circumstances where, due to the nature of the research being supported, the Foundation requires greater control over resulting inventions. The NSF Grants or Contracts Officer, with concurrence of the cognizant Program Manager, will negotiate a background rights provision. If the affected awardee is a small business firm or nonprofit organization, the provision will conform to the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. 202(f)) as implemented by 37 CFR 401.12).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Waste disposal.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The following wastes shall be removed from Antarctica:</P>
              <P>(i) Radioactive materials;</P>
              <P>(ii) Electrical batteries;</P>
              <P>(iii) Fuel (both liquid and solid);</P>
              <P>(iv) Waste containing harmful levels of heavy metals or acutely toxic or harmful persistent compounds;</P>
              <P>(v) Poly-vinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane foam, polystyrene foam, rubber and lubricating oils, treated timbers and other products containing additives which can produce harmful emissions or releases;</P>
              <P>(vi) All other plastic wastes except low density polyethylene containers (such as bags for storing wastes) provided such containers are incinerated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;</P>
              <P>(vii) Solid, non-combustible wastes; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Fuel, oil and chemical drums that constitute waste.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the obligations set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) (vii) and (viii) of this section shall not apply if the Director determines that the removal of such wastes by any practicable option would cause greater adverse environmental impacts than would be caused by leaving them in their existing locations.</P>
              <P>(b) All liquid wastes other than sewage and domestic liquid wastes and wastes referred in paragraph (a) of this section shall be removed from Antarctica to the maximum extent practicable.</P>
              <P>(c) Sewage and domestic liquid wastes may be discharged directly into the sea, taking into account the assimilative capacity of the receiving marine environment, and provided that such discharge occurs, wherever practicable, where conditions exist for initial dilution and rapid dispersal, and further provided that large quantities of such wastes (generated in a station where the average weekly occupancy over the austral summer is approximately 30 individuals or more) shall be treated at least by maceration. If biological treatment processes are used, the by-product of such treatment may be disposed of into the sea provided disposal does not adversely affect the local environment.</P>
              <P>(d) Residues of introduced animal carcasses, laboratory culture of micro-organisms and plant pathogens, and introduced avian products must be removed from Antarctica unless incinerated, autoclaved or otherwise sterilized.</P>
              <P>(e) Combustible wastes not removed from Antarctica other than wastes referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be burnt in incinerators which reduce harmful emissions or discharges to the maximum extent practicable and the solid residue of such incineration shall be removed from Antarctica; provided, however, that USAP may continue to bury such combustible wastes in snow pits at South Pole Station, but must phase out such practices before March 1, 1995. Any emission or discharge standards and equipment guidelines which may be recommended by the Committee for Environmental Protection constituted or to be constituted pursuant to the Protocol or by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research shall be taken into account.</P>

              <P>(f) Sewage and domestic liquid wastes and other liquid wastes not removed from Antarctica in accordance with other provisions of this section, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, not be disposed of onto sea ice, ice shelves or grounded ice-sheet unless such wastes were generated by stations located inland on ice shelves or on the grounded ice-sheet. In such event, the wastes may be disposed of in deep ice pits if that is the only practicable option, provided the ice pits are not located on known ice-flow lines which <PRTPAGE P="183"/>terminate at ice-free land areas or in blue ice areas of high ablation.</P>
              <P>(g) No wastes may be disposed of onto ice-free areas or into any fresh water system.</P>
              <P>(h) Open burning of wastes is prohibited at all permanent stations, and shall be phased out at all other locations by March 1, 1994. If it is necessary to dispose of waste by open burning prior to March 1, 1994, allowance shall be made for the wind direction and speed and the type of waste to be burnt to limit particulate deposition and to avoid such deposition over areas of special biological, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness significance.</P>
              <P>(i) Each unauthorized release of waste in Antarctic shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, promptly cleaned up by the person responsible for such release.</P>

              <P>(4) Programs for cleaning up existing waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites.</P>
              <P>(c) USAP shall designate one or more waste management officials to develop and monitor waste management plans and ensure that members of expeditions receive training so as to limit the impact of their activities on the Antarctic environment, and to inform them of the requirements of the Protocol and of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) USAP shall, to the extent practicable, prepare an inventory of locations of past activities (i.e., traverses, fuel depots, field bases, crashed aircraft) so that such locations can be taken into account in planning future scientific, logistic and waste management programs.</P>
              <P>(e) USAP shall clean up its past and present waste disposal sites on land and abandoned work sites, except that it shall not be required to:</P>
              <P>(1) Remove any structure designated as a historic site or monument; or</P>
              <P>(2) Remove any structure or waste in circumstances where the removal would result in greater adverse environmental impact than leaving the structure or waste in its existing location.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Intervention.</E> A motion for leave to intervene in any proceeding conducted under these rules must set forth the grounds for the proposed intervention, the position and interest of the movant, and whether the intervention will <PRTPAGE P="189"/>cause delay. Any person already a party to the proceeding may file an answer to a motion to intervene, making specific reference to the factors set forth in the foregoing sentence and paragraph (c) of this section, within ten (10) days after service of the motion for leave to intervene.</P>
            <P>(c) A motion for leave to intervene in a proceeding must ordinarily be filed before the first prehearing conference, or if there is no such conference, prior to the setting of a time and place for a hearing.

            <P>(2) A request for an order to either revoke or suspend the permit and a statement of the terms and conditions of any proposed partial suspension or revocation; and</P>
            <P>(3) A statement indicating the basis for recommending the revocation, rather than the suspension, of the permit, or vice versa.</P>

            <P>(h) <E T="03">Withdrawal of the complaint.</E> The complainant may withdraw the complaint, or any part thereof, without prejudice one time before the answer has been filed.

            <P>(i) Complainant, in cooperation with the Office of General Counsel, may refer cases to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution if there is reason to believe that respondent willfully violated the Antarctic Conservation Act or its attendant regulations. Such referral does not automatically preclude NSF from proceeding administratively under the Act and these rules against the same respondent.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Default.</E> The Presiding Officer may find a party in default (1) after motion, upon failure to file a timely answer to the complaint; (2) after motion or sua sponte, upon failure to comply with a prehearing or hearing order of the Presiding Officer; or (3) after motion or sua sponte, upon failure to appear at a conference or hearing without good cause being shown. No finding of default on the basis of a failure to appear at a hearing shall be made against the respondent unless the complainant presents sufficient evidence to the Presiding Officer to establish a prima facie case against the respondent. Any motion for a default order shall include a proposed default order and shall be served upon all parties. The alleged defaulting party shall have twenty (20) days from service to reply to the motion. Default by respondent constitutes, for purposes of the pending action only, an admission of all facts alleged in the complaint and a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing on such factual allegations.

If the complaint is for the revocation or suspension of a permit, the conditions of revocation or suspension proposed in the complaint shall become effective without further proceedings on the date designated by the Presiding Officer in his final order issued upon default. Default by the complainant shall result in the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Settlement policy.</E> The Agency encourages settlement of a proceeding at any time if the settlement is consistent with the provisions and objectives of the Act and applicable regulations. The respondent may confer with complainant concerning settlement whether or not the respondent requests a hearing. Settlement conferences shall not affect the respondent's obligation to file a timely answer.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Consent agreement.</E> The parties shall forward a written consent agreement and a proposed consent order to the Presiding Officer whenever settlement or compromise is proposed.

Documents and exhibits shall be marked for identification as ordered by the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer may exclude from evidence any document or testimony not disclosed at the prehearing conference. If the Presiding Officer permits the submittal of new evidence, he will grant parties a reasonable opportunity to respond.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Record of the prehearing conference.</E> No transcript of a prehearing conference relating to settlement shall be made. With respect to other prehearing conferences, no transcript of any prehearing conferences shall be made unless ordered by the Presiding Officer upon motion of a party or sua sponte.

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Other discovery.</E> (1) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, further discovery shall be permitted only upon determination by the Presiding Officer that (i) such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the proceeding; (ii) the information to be obtained is not otherwise obtainable; and (iii) such information has significant probative value.</P>
            <P>(2) The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that (i) the information sought cannot be obtained by alternative methods; or (ii) there is substantial reason to believe that relevant and probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a witness at the hearing.</P>

            <P>(3) Any party may request further discovery by motion. Such a motion shall set forth (i) the circumstances <PRTPAGE P="193"/>warranting the taking of the discovery; (ii) the nature of the information expected to be discovered; and (iii) the proposed time and place where it will be taken. If the Presiding Officer determines that the motion should be granted, he shall issue an order granting discovery, with any qualifying conditions and terms.</P>
            <P>(4) When the information sought to be obtained is within the control of one of the parties, failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to this paragraph may lead to (i) the inference that the information to be discovered would be adverse to the party from whom the information was sought; or (ii) the issuance of a default.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Presiding Officer, upon motion of any party or sua sponte, may at any time render an accelerated decision in favor of the complainant or the respondent as to all or any part of the proceeding, without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence, such as affidavits, as he may require, if no genuine issue of material fact exists and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law regarding all or any part of the proceeding. In addition, the Presiding Officer, upon motion of the respondent, may at any time dismiss an action without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence as he requires, if complainant fails to establish a prima facie case, or if other grounds show complainant has no right to relief.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect.</E> (1) If an accelerated decision or a decision to dismiss is issued as to all the issues and claims in the proceeding, the decision constitutes an initial decision of the Presiding Officer, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.</P>
            <P>(2) If an accelerated decision or a decision to dismiss is rendered on less than all issues or claims in the proceeding, the Presiding Officer shall determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts remain controverted in good faith. He shall then issue an interlocutory order specifying the facts which appear substantially uncontroverted, and the issues and claims upon which the hearing will proceed.</P>

            <P>(a) When an answer is filed, the Hearing Clerk shall forward the complaint, the answer, and any other documents filed thus far in the proceeding to the Presiding Officer, who will notify the parties of his assignment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of hearing.</E> If the respondent requests a hearing in his answer, or one is ordered by the Presiding Officer, the Presiding Officer shall serve upon the parties a notice setting forth a time and place for the hearing. The Presiding Officer may issue the notice of hearing at any appropriate time, but not later than twenty (20) days prior to the date set for the hearing.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Postponement of hearing.</E> The Presiding Officer will not grant a request for postponement of a hearing except upon motion and for good cause shown.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Evidence.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Presiding Officer shall admit all evidence which is not irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or otherwise unreliable or of little probative value. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, evidence relating to settlement which would be excluded in the federal courts under Ru1e 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is inadmissible. In the presentation, admission, disposition, and use of evidence, the Presiding Officer shall preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets and other commercial and financial information. The confidential or trade secret status of any information shall not, however, preclude its introduction into evidence. The Presiding Officer may review such evidence in camera, and issue appropriate protective orders.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Examination of witnesses.</E> Parties shall examine witnesses orally, under oath or affirmation, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by the Presiding Officer. Parties shall have the right to cross-examine a witness who appears at the hearing.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Verified statements.</E> The Presiding Officer may admit into the record as evidence, in lieu of oral testimony, statements of fact or opinion prepared <PRTPAGE P="194"/>by a witness. The admissibility of the evidence contained in the statement shall be subject to the same rules as if the testimony were produced under oral examination. Before any such statement is read or admitted into evidence, the witness shall deliver a copy of the statement to the Presiding Officer, the reporter, and opposing counsel. The witness presenting the statement shall swear to or affirm the statement and shall be subject to appropriate oral cross-examination.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Admission of affidavits where the witness is unavailable.</E> The Presiding Officer may admit into evidence affidavits of witnesses who are “unavailable,” within the meaning of that term under Rule 804(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> Where practicable, an original and one copy of each exhibit shall be filed with the Presiding Officer for the record and a copy shall be furnished to each party. A true copy of any exhibit may be substituted for the original.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice may be taken of any matter judicially noticeable in the Federal courts and of other facts within the specialized knowledge and experience of the Agency. Opposing parties shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Objection.</E> Any objection concerning the conduct of the hearing may be made orally or in writing during the hearing. The party raising the objection must supply a short statement of its grounds. The ruling by the Presiding Officer on any objection and the reasons given for it shall be part of the record. An exception to each objection overruled shall be automatic and is not waived by further participation in the hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering the evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the record. The offer of proof for excluded oral testimony shall consist of a brief statement describing the nature of the evidence excluded. The offer of proof for excluded documents or exhibits shall consist of the insertion in the record of the documents or exhibits excluded.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing and contents.</E> The Presiding Officer shall issue and file with the Hearing Clerk an initial decision as soon as practicable after the period for filing reply briefs, if any, has expired. The initial decision shall contain findings of fact, conclusions regarding all material issues of law or discretion, the reasons for the findings and conclusions, a recommended civil penalty assessment or other sanction, if appropriate, and a proposed final order. Upon receipt of an initial decision, the Hearing Clerk shall forward a copy to all parties, and shall send the original, along with the record of the proceeding, to the Director.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of civil penalty.</E> If the Presiding Officer determines that a violation has occurred, he shall set the dollar amount of the recommended civil penalty in the initial decision in accordance with any criteria set forth in the Act, and must consider any civil penalty guidelines issued by NSF. If the Presiding Officer decides to assess a penalty different in amount from the penalty recommended in the complaint, he shall set forth in the initial decision the specific reasons for the increase or decrease. The Presiding Officer shall not raise a penalty from that recommended in the complaint if the respondent has defaulted.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of initial decision.</E> The initial decision of the Presiding Officer shall become the final order of the Agency within forty-five (45) days after its service upon the parties and without further proceedings unless (1) an appeal to the Director is filed by a party to the proceedings; or (2) the Director elects, sua sponte, to review the initial decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Motion to reopen a hearing.</E> A motion to reopen a hearing to take further evidence must be made no later than twenty (20) days after service of the initial decision on the parties and shall (1) state the specific grounds upon which relief is sought; (2) state briefly the nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced; (3) show that such evidence is not cumulative; and (4) show good cause why such evidence was not adduced at the hearing. The motion shall be made to the Presiding Officer and filed with the Hearing Clerk. Parties shall have ten (10) days following service to respond. The Presiding Officer shall grant or deny such motion as soon as practicable. The conduct of any proceeding which may be required as a result of the granting of any motion to reopen shall be governed by the provisions of the applicable sections of these rules. The filing of a motion to reopen a hearing shall automatically stay the running of all time periods specified under these Rules until such time as the motion is denied or the reopened hearing is concluded.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeal from or review of interlocutory orders or rulings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for interlocutory orders or rulings.</E> Except as provided in this section, appeals to the Director or, upon delegation, to the General Counsel, shall obtain as a matter of right only from a default order, an accelerated decision or decision to dismiss, or an initial decision rendered after an evidentiary hearing. Appeals from other orders or rulings shall lie only if the Presiding Officer, upon motion of a party, certifies such orders or rulings to the Director on appeal. Requests for such certification shall be filed in writing within six (6) days of notice of the ruling or service of the order, and shall state briefly the grounds to be relied upon on appeal.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Availability of interlocutory appeal.</E> The Presiding Officer may certify any ruling for appeal to the Director when (1) the order or ruling involves an important question of law or policy and there is substantial grounds for difference of opinion; and (2) either (i) an immediate appeal from the order or ruling will materially advance the ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or (ii) review after the final order is issued will be inadequate or ineffective.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Decision.</E> If the Director or the General Counsel takes no action within thirty (30) days of the certification, the appeal is dismissed. If the Director or the General Counsel decides to hear the interlocutory appeal, he shall make and transmit his findings and conclusions to the Presiding Officer. When the Presiding Officer declines to certify an order or ruling to the Director on <PRTPAGE P="196"/>interlocutory appeal, it may be reviewed by the Director only upon appeal from the initial decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Stay of proceedings.</E> The Presiding Officer may stay the proceedings for an interlocutory appeal. Proceedings will not be stayed except in extraordinary circumstances. Where the Presiding Officer grants a stay of more than thirty (30) days, such stay must be separately approved by the Director.</P>

The notice of appeal shall set forth alternative findings of fact, alternative conclusions regarding issues of law or discretion, and a proposed order together with relevant references to the record and the initial decision. The appellant's brief shall contain a statement of the issues presented for review, argument on the issues presented, and a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought, together with appropriate references to the record. Within twenty (20) days of the service of notices of appeal and briefs, any other party or amicus curiae may file with the Hearing Clerk a reply brief responding to argument raised by the appellant, together with references to the relevant portions of the record, initial decision, or opposing brief. Reply briefs shall be limited to the scope of the appeal brief.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Sua sponte review by the Director.</E> Whenever the Director determines sua sponte to review an initial decision, the Hearing Clerk shall serve notice of such intention on the parties within forty-five (45) days after the initial decision is served upon the parties. The notice shall include a statement of issues to be briefed by the parties and a time schedule for the service and filing of briefs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope of appeal or review.</E> The appeal of the initial decision shall be limited to those issues raised by the parties during the course of the proceeding. If the Director determines that issues raised, but not appealed by the parties, should be argued, he shall give the parties or their representatives written notice of such determination to permit preparation of adequate argument. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Director from remanding the case to the Presiding Officer for further proceedings.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Argument.</E> The Director may, upon request of a party or sua sponte, assign a time and place for oral argument.</P>

The Director shall adopt, modify or set aside the findings and conclusions contained in the decision or order being reviewed and shall set forth in the final order the reasons for his actions. The Director may, in his discretion, increase or decrease the assessed penalty from the amount recommended in the decision or order being reviewed, except that if the order being reviewed is a default order, the Director may not increase the amount of the penalty.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment of a civil penalty.</E> The respondent shall pay the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the final order within sixty (60) days after receipt of the final order unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for collection, handling, documentation, and curation of Antarctic meteorites.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any person organizing an expedition to or within Antarctica, where one of the purposes of the expedition is to collect meteorites in Antarctica, shall ensure that the meteorites will be properly collected, documented, handled, and curated to preserve their scientific value. Curation includes making specimens available to bona fide scientific researchers on a timely basis, in accordance with specified procedures.</P>
            <P>(b) Expedition organizers described in paragraph (a) of this section shall develop and implement written procedures for the collection, documentation, and curation of specimens which include the following components:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Handling requirements.</E> Handling procedures shall ensure that the specimens are properly labeled and handled to minimize the potential for contamination from the point of collection to the point of curation. At a minimum, handling procedures shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) Handling the samples with clean Teflon or polyethylene coated implements or stainless steel implements (or equivalent);</P>
            <P>(ii) Double bagging of samples in Teflon or polyethylene (or equivalent) bags;</P>
            <P>(iii) A unique sample identifier included with the sample;</P>
            <P>(iv) Keeping the samples frozen at or below −15 °C until opened and thawed in a clean laboratory setting at the curation facility; and</P>
            <P>(v) Thawing in a clean, dry, non-reactive gas environment, such as nitrogen or argon.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Sample documentation.</E> Documentation for each specimen, that includes, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(i) A unique identifier for the sample;</P>
            <P>(ii) The date of find;</P>
            <P>(iii) The date of collection (if different from date of find);</P>
            <P>(iv) The latitude and longitude to within 500 meters of the location of the find and the name of the nearest named geographical feature;</P>
            <P>(v) The name, organizational affiliation, and address of the finder or the expedition organizer;</P>
            <P>(vi) A physical description of the specimen and of the location of the find; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Any observations of the collection activity, such as potential contamination of the specimen.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Curation.</E> Make prior arrangements to ensure that any specimens collected in Antarctica will be maintained in a curatorial facility that will:</P>
            <P>(i) Preserve the specimens in a manner that precludes chemical or physical degradation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Produce an authoritative classification for meteorites that can be shown to belong to a well-established chemical and petrological group, and provide appropriate descriptions for those meteorites that cannot be shown to belong to an established chemical and petrological group;</P>
            <P>(iii) Develop and maintain curatorial records associated with the meteorites including collection information, authoritative classification, total known mass, information about handling and sample preparation activities that have been performed on the meteorite, and sub-sample information;</P>
            <P>(iv) Submit an appropriate summary of information about the meteorites to the Antarctic Master Directory via the National Antarctic Data Coordination Center as soon as possible, but no later than two years after receipt of samples at the curatorial facility;</P>
            <P>(v) Submit information on classification of the meteorite to an internationally recognized meteorite research catalog, such as the “Catalogue of Meteorites” published by the Natural History Museum of London or the “Meteoritical Bulletin” published by the Meteoritical Society;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Medical examinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any individual seeking to travel to Antarctica under sponsorship of the United States Antarctic Program must undergo a medical and dental examination to determine whether the individual is physically qualified for deployment to Antarctica.</P>
            <P>(b) The medical and dental examinations may be conducted by a qualified licensed physician or dentist of the candidate's choosing, or designated by the employing organization, following instructions provided by the USAP. The medical examinations shall include a medical history, physical examination and appropriate clinical tests which address major organ systems for medical conditions inconsistent with safe deployment to Antarctica.</P>

            <P>(c) The candidate's physician/dentist will submit the required medical information on the appropriate USAP-provided forms to a USAP-designated physician who will determine whether the individual is qualified for deployment to Antarctica based upon Medical Clearance Criteria established by the <PRTPAGE P="201"/>USAP. All information requested on the forms shall be provided.</P>
            <P>(d) Candidates who anticipate spending the austral winter in Antarctica (when evacuation may be impossible) are subject to additional evaluation, including a determination of psychological adaptability for such an isolated assignment. Psychological evaluations of “winter-over” candidates shall be performed by a qualified team of USAP-designated physicians/clinical psychologists.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Staff involvement with NSF proposals and awards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Many scientists, engineers, and educators interrupt active research and teaching careers to spend a year or two at NSF and then return to research and teaching, usually at the same institution from which they came. Many such visiting scientists, engineers, and educators (and a few permanent employees) who have been principal investigators under NSF awards before coming to NSF, retain some interest or association with the work. If an individual is a principal investigator under an NSF award, the individual is not precluded from retaining ties to the work after becoming an NSF employee. The employee may stay in contact with those who are continuing the work in the employee's laboratory or on his or her project. The employee may continue to supervise graduate students. And the employee may visit and work in the laboratory on his or her own time for these and related purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) Before a prospective employee comes to NSF, the prospective employee and the grantee institution must designate, subject to NSF approval, a “substitute principal investigator”—i.e., another scientist who will be responsible for the work and equipment and will represent the institution in any dealings with NSF officials while the prospective employee is at NSF.</P>
              <P>(3) Appointment of a substitute principal investigator is unnecessary if all work under an award is to be completely suspended while the employee is at NSF. If the work is to be suspended, the employee and the grantee institution must inform the NSF in writing before the employee's employment begins. Work under the award may be resumed when the employee completes his or her NSF employment, and its term may be extended to account for the time lost during the employee's NSF employment.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) NSF will entertain no proposal on which a current NSF employee would be a senior investigator or equivalent, unless it is a proposal for continuation or extension of support for work on which the employee served in that capacity before coming to NSF. Any proposal for continuation of NSF support at essentially the same level (with reasonable allowance for inflation) will normally be considered a proposal for continuation or extension if it would support the work of the same investigator and his or her laboratory or group (if any) in the same general field of science, engineering, or education, notwithstanding that the focus of the work may change in response to research opportunities or educational needs.</P>
              <P>(2) Someone other than the current NSF employee must submit any such proposal for continuation or extension of work NSF previously supported and handle all negotiations with NSF, but the capacity in which the current NSF employee will serve should be clearly spelled out in the proposal.</P>

              <P>(c) In accordance with 5 CFR 5301.103(a)(1), an NSF employee may not receive, directly or indirectly, any <PRTPAGE P="203"/>salary, consulting fee, honorarium, or other form of compensation for services, or reimbursement of expenses, from an NSF award.</P>

              <SUBJECT>One-year NSF post-employment restrictions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For one year after leaving NSF employment, a former NSF employee, including a special Government employee who has performed work for NSF on more than 60 days in the previous twelve months, shall not represent himself, herself, or any other person in dealings with any NSF official on any proposal, project, or other particular matter.</P>
              <P>(b) The one-year restriction contained in paragraph (a) of this section is in addition to any post-employment restriction imposed by statute, including 18 U.S.C. 207 and 41 U.S.C. 423. To the extent that any disqualification required by paragraph (a) of this section is not also required by statute, written exceptions may be granted by the NSF's General Counsel, whose decisions shall be final. Exceptions will be rare and will be granted only where strict application of the rules would result in undue hardship for former short-term employees or for other former employees, and when granting an exception would not result in an unfair advantage to the former employee.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to particular matters involving specific parties, such as grants, contracts, or other agreements; applications for permits, licenses, or the like; requests for rulings or similar official determinations; claims; investigations or audits; charges or accusations against individuals or firms; adjudicatory hearings; and court cases.</P>
              <P>(2) For former employees, other than special Government employees, paragraph (a) of this section also applies to particular matters that do not involve specific parties, such as:</P>
              <P>(i) Determinations to establish or dis-establish a particular program or set its budget level for a particular fiscal year;</P>
              <P>(ii) Decisions to undertake or terminate a particular project;</P>
              <P>(iii) Decisions to open or not open a contract to competitive bidding;</P>
              <P>(iv) General policy or rulemaking—including, for example, decisions on particular NSF rules or formal policy, such as adoption or amendment of a resolution by the National Science Board, promulgation or amendment of an NSF regulation or circular, amendment of standard grant or contract terms, or changes to NSF manuals or policy documents; and</P>
              <P>(v) Agency positions on particular legislative or regulatory proposals.</P>
              <P>(d) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to:</P>
              <P>(1) Any expression of a former employee's views on policy issues where the circumstances make it obvious that the former employee is only speaking as an informed and interested citizen, not representing any financial or other interests of his or her own or of any other person or institution with which he or she is associated;</P>
              <P>(2) Any appearance or communication concerning matters of a personal or individual nature, such as the former employee's taxes, salary, benefits, possible Federal employment, rights as a former employee, or the application of conflict-of-interest rules to something the former employee proposes to do;</P>
              <P>(3) Any appearance on the former employee's own behalf in any litigation or administrative proceeding; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any presentation of scientific or technical information (at a site visit, for example) or any other communication of scientific or technical information on work being proposed or conducted.</P>

              <P>(e) As soon as his or her NSF employment ceases, a former NSF employee (including any former special Government employee described in paragraph (a) of this section) may again be listed as principal investigator on an NSF award, may be listed as principal investigator in any proposal or award, and may sign a proposal as principal investigator. However, the former employee and the grantee institution shall formally designate, subject to NSF approval, a “substitute negotiator” who, though not principally responsible for the work, will represent the former employee and the institution in dealings with NSF officials on any proposal or <PRTPAGE P="204"/>project for as long as the former employee would be barred from representational contacts with NSF by paragraph (a) of this section or by statute.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purposes for “substitute” requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Appointment of a “substitute principal investigator” or “substitute negotiator” ensures against unthinking violation of the restrictions on dealings with NSF officials. It serves this purpose by flagging proposals or awards affected by the restrictions and by identifying someone else with whom NSF officials can properly discuss them or negotiate over them. Designation of a substitute principal investigator while an employee is at NSF has two additional functions: it identifies another person to be responsible for the work and equipment, and it reminds all concerned that during an employee's NSF service his or her attentions should focus on NSF duties.</P>

              <P>(g) Notice of the maximum penalty, which may be assessed under part 681 of this title for calendar years after 2016, will be published by NSF in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on an annual basis on or before January 15 of each calendar year.</P>

              <P>(a) If the investigating official concludes that an action under this part is warranted, the investigating official submits a report containing the findings and conclusions of the investigation to the reviewing official. If the reviewing official determines that the report provides adequate evidence that a person made a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim or statement, the reviewing official shall transmit to the Attorney General written notice of an intention to refer the matter for adjudication, with a request for approval of such referral. This notice will include the reviewing official's statements concerning:</P>
              <P>(1) The reasons for the referral;</P>

              <P>(6) A statement that there is a reasonable prospect of collecting an appropriate amount of penalties and assessments.</P>
              <P>(b) If, at any time, the Attorney General or his or her designee requests in writing that this administrative process be stayed, the authority head, as identified in § 681.2(c) of this part, must stay the process immediately. The authority head may order the process resumed only upon receipt of the written authorization of the Attorney General.</P>

              <P>(a) A defendant may file an answer with the reviewing official within 30 days of service of the complaint. An answer will be considered a request for an oral hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) In the answer, a defendant—</P>
              <P>(1) Must admit or deny each of the allegations of liability contained in the complaint (a failure to deny an allegation is considered an admission);</P>
              <P>(2) Must state any defense on which the defendant intends to rely;</P>
              <P>(3) May state any reasons why he or she believes the penalties, assessments, or both should be less than the statutory maximum; and</P>
              <P>(4) Must state the name, address, and telephone number of the person authorized by the defendant to act as the defendant's representative, if any.</P>
              <P>(c) If the defendant is unable to file a timely answer which meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the defendant may file with the reviewing official a general answer denying liability, requesting a hearing, and requesting an extension of time in which to file a complete answer. A general answer must be filed within 30 days of service of the complaint.</P>
              <P>(d) If the defendant initially files a general answer requesting an extension of time, the reviewing official must promptly file with the ALJ the complaint, the general answer, and the request for an extension of time.</P>

              <P>(a) If a defendant does not file any answer within 30 days after service of the complaint, the reviewing official may refer the complaint to the ALJ.</P>
              <P>(b) Once the complaint is referred, the ALJ will promptly serve on the defendant a notice that an initial decision will be issued.</P>
              <P>(c) The ALJ will assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and, if such facts establish liability under the statute, the ALJ will issue an initial decision imposing the maximum amount of penalties and assessments allowed under PFCRA.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, when a defendant fails to file a timely answer, the defendant waives any right to further review of the penalties and assessments imposed in the initial decision.</P>
              <P>(e) The initial decision becomes final 30 days after it is issued.</P>
              <P>(f) At any time before an initial decision becomes final, a defendant may file a motion with the ALJ asking that the case be reopened. An ALJ may only reopen a case if, in this motion, he or she determines that the defendant set forth extraordinary circumstances that prevented the defendant from filing a timely answer. The initial decision will be stayed until the ALJ makes a decision on the motion. The reviewing official may respond to the motion.</P>
              <P>(g) If the ALJ determines that a defendant has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances excusing his failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will withdraw the initial decision, and grant the defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.</P>
              <P>(h) A decision by the ALJ to deny a defendant's motion to reopen a case is not subject to reconsideration under § 681.35.</P>
              <P>(i) The defendant may appeal to the authority head the decision denying a motion to reopen by filing a notice of appeal with the authority head within 15 days after the ALJ denies the motion. The timely filing of a notice of appeal shall stay the initial decision until the authority head decides the issue.</P>

              <P>(j) If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the authority head, <PRTPAGE P="209"/>the ALJ shall forward the record of the proceeding to the authority head.</P>
              <P>(k) The authority head shall decide expeditiously, based solely on the record before the ALJ, whether extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer.</P>
              <P>(l) If the authority head decides that extraordinary circumstances excused the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the authority head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the defendant an opportunity to answer.</P>
              <P>(m) If the authority head decides that the defendant's failure to file a timely answer is not excused, the authority head shall reinstate the initial decision of the ALJ, which shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after the authority head issues such a decision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General policies and responsibilities.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) NSF will take appropriate action against individuals or institutions upon a finding that research misconduct has occurred. Possible actions are described in § 689.3. NSF may also take interim action during an investigation, as described in § 689.8.<PRTPAGE P="218"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) NSF will find research misconduct only after careful inquiry and investigation by an awardee institution, by another Federal agency, or by NSF. An “inquiry” consists of preliminary information-gathering and preliminary fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct has substance and if an investigation is warranted. An investigation must be undertaken if the inquiry determines the allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct has substance. An “investigation” is a formal development, examination and evaluation of a factual record to determine whether research misconduct has taken place, to assess its extent and consequences, and to evaluate appropriate action.</P>
            <P>(c) A finding of research misconduct requires that—</P>
            <P>(1) There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community; and</P>
            <P>(2) The research misconduct be committed intentionally, or knowingly, or recklessly; and</P>
            <P>(3) The allegation be proven by a preponderance of evidence.</P>
            <P>(d) Before NSF makes any final finding of research misconduct or takes any final action on such a finding, NSF will normally afford the accused individual or institution notice, a chance to provide comments and rebuttal, and a chance to appeal. In structuring procedures in individual cases, NSF may take into account procedures already followed by other entities investigating or adjudicating the same allegation of research misconduct.</P>
            <P>(e) Debarment or suspension for research misconduct will be imposed only after further procedures described in applicable debarment and suspension regulations, as described in §§ 689.8 and 689.9, respectively. Severe research misconduct, as established under the regulations in this part, is an independent cause for debarment or suspension under the procedures established by the debarment and suspension regulations.</P>
            <P>(f) The Office of Inspector General (OIG) oversees investigations of research misconduct and conducts any NSF inquiries and investigations into suspected or alleged research misconduct.</P>
            <P>(g) The Deputy Director adjudicates research misconduct proceedings and the Director decides appeals.</P>
            <P>(h) Investigative and adjudicative research misconduct records maintained by the agency are exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) to the extent permitted by law and regulation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Possible final actions listed in this paragraph (a) for guidance range from minimal restrictions (Group I) to the most severe and restrictive (Group III). They are not exhaustive and do not include possible criminal sanctions.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Group I actions.</E> (i) Send a letter of reprimand to the individual or institution.</P>
            <P>(ii) Require as a condition of an award that for a specified period an individual or institution obtain special prior approval of particular activities from NSF.</P>
            <P>(iii) Require for a specified period that an institutional official other than those guilty of misconduct certify the accuracy of reports generated under an award or provide assurance of compliance with particular policies, regulations, guidelines, or special terms and conditions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Group II actions.</E> (i) Totally or partially suspend an active award, or restrict for a specified period designated activities or expenditures under an active award.</P>
            <P>(ii) Require for a specified period special reviews of all requests for funding from an affected individual or institution to ensure that steps have been taken to prevent repetition of the misconduct.</P>
            <P>(iii) Require a correction to the research record.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Group III actions.</E> (i) Terminate an active award.</P>
            <P>(ii) Prohibit participation of an individual as an NSF reviewer, advisor, or consultant for a specified period.</P>

            <P>(iii) Debar or suspend an individual or institution from participation in Federal programs for a specified period <PRTPAGE P="219"/>after further proceedings under applicable regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) In deciding what final actions are appropriate when misconduct is found, NSF officials should consider:</P>
            <P>(1) How serious the misconduct was;</P>
            <P>(2) The degree to which the misconduct was knowing, intentional, or reckless;</P>
            <P>(3) Whether it was an isolated event or part of a pattern;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether it had a significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions or the public welfare; and</P>
            <P>(5) Other relevant circumstances.</P>
            <P>(c) Interim actions may include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Totally or partially suspending an existing award;</P>
            <P>(2) Suspending eligibility for Federal awards in accordance with debarment-and-suspension regulations;</P>
            <P>(3) Proscribing or restricting particular research activities, as, for example, to protect human or animal subjects;</P>
            <P>(4) Requiring special certifications, assurances, or other, administrative arrangements to ensure compliance with applicable regulations or terms of the award;</P>
            <P>(5) Requiring more prior approvals by NSF;</P>
            <P>(6) Deferring funding action on continuing grant increments;</P>
            <P>(7) Deferring a pending award;</P>
            <P>(8) Restricting or suspending participation as an NSF reviewer, advisor, or consultant.</P>
            <P>(d) For those cases governed by the debarment and suspension regulations, the standards of proof contained in the debarment and suspension regulations shall control. Otherwise, NSF will take no final action under this section without a finding of misconduct supported by a preponderance of the relevant evidence.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 689.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Role of awardee institutions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Awardee institutions bear primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of alleged research misconduct. In most instances, NSF will rely on awardee institutions to promptly:</P>
            <P>(1) Initiate an inquiry into any suspected or alleged research misconduct;</P>
            <P>(2) Conduct a subsequent investigation, if warranted;</P>
            <P>(3) Take action necessary to ensure the integrity of research, the rights and interests of research subjects and the public, and the observance of legal requirements or responsibilities; and</P>
            <P>(4) Provide appropriate safeguards for subjects of allegations as well as informants.</P>
            <P>(b) If an institution wishes NSF to defer independent inquiry or investigation, it should:</P>
            <P>(1) Complete any inquiry and decide whether an investigation is warranted within 90 days. If completion of an inquiry is delayed, but the institution wishes NSF deferral to continue, NSF may require submission of periodic status reports.</P>
            <P>(2) Inform OIG immediately if an initial inquiry supports a formal investigation.</P>
            <P>(3) Keep OIG informed during such an investigation.</P>
            <P>(4) Complete any investigation and reach a disposition within 180 days. If completion of an investigation is delayed, but the institution wishes NSF deferral to continue, NSF may require submission of periodic status reports.</P>
            <P>(5) Provide OIG with the final report from any investigation.</P>
            <P>(c) NSF expects institutions to promptly notify OIG should the institution become aware during an inquiry or investigation that:</P>
            <P>(1) Public health or safety is at risk;</P>
            <P>(2) NSF's resources, reputation, or other interests need protecting;</P>
            <P>(3) There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law;</P>
            <P>(4) Research activities should be suspended;</P>
            <P>(5) Federal action may be needed to protect the interests of a subject of the investigation or of others potentially affected; or</P>
            <P>(6) The scientific community or the public should be informed.</P>
            <P>(d) Awardee institutions should maintain and effectively communicate to their staffs appropriate policies and procedures relating to research misconduct, which should indicate when NSF should be notified.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Initial NSF handling of misconduct matters.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NSF staff who learn of alleged misconduct will promptly and discreetly inform OIG or refer informants to OIG.</P>
            <P>(b) The identity of informants who wish to remain anonymous will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law or regulation.</P>
            <P>(c) If OIG determines that alleged research misconduct involves potential civil or criminal violations, OIG may refer the matter to the Department of Justice.</P>
            <P>(d) Otherwise OIG may:</P>
            <P>(1) Inform the awardee institution of the alleged research misconduct and encourage it to undertake an inquiry;</P>
            <P>(2) Defer to inquiries or investigations of the awardee institution or of another Federal agency; or</P>
            <P>(3) At any time proceed with its own inquiry.</P>
            <P>(e) If OIG proceeds with its own inquiry it will normally complete the inquiry no more than 90 days after initiating it.</P>
            <P>(f) On the basis of what it learns from an inquiry and in consultation as appropriate with other NSF offices, OIG will decide whether a formal NSF investigation is warranted.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 689.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Investigations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When an awardee institution or another Federal agency has promptly initiated its own investigation, OIG may defer an NSF inquiry or investigation until it receives the results of that external investigation. If it does not receive the results within 180 days, OIG may proceed with its own investigation.</P>
            <P>(b) If OIG decides to initiate an NSF investigation, it must give prompt written notice to the individual or institutions to be investigated, unless notice would prejudice the investigation or unless a criminal investigation is underway or under active consideration. If notice is delayed, it must be given as soon as it will no longer prejudice the investigation or contravene requirements of law or Federal law-enforcement policies.</P>
            <P>(c) If a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or another Federal agency is underway or under active consideration by these agencies or the NSF, OIG will determine what information, if any, may be disclosed to the subject of the investigation or to other NSF employees.</P>
            <P>(d) An NSF investigation may include:</P>
            <P>(1) Review of award files, reports, and other documents already readily available at NSF or in the public domain;</P>
            <P>(2) Review of procedures or methods and inspection of laboratory materials, specimens, and records at awardee institutions;</P>
            <P>(3) Interviews with subjects or witnesses;</P>
            <P>(4) Review of any documents or other evidence provided by or properly obtainable from parties, witnesses, or other sources;</P>
            <P>(5) Cooperation with other Federal agencies; and</P>
            <P>(6) Opportunity for the subject of the investigation to be heard.</P>
            <P>(e) OIG may invite outside consultants or experts to participate in an NSF investigation. They should be appointed in a manner that ensures the official nature of their involvement and provides them with legal protections available to federal employees.</P>
            <P>(f) OIG will make every reasonable effort to complete an NSF investigation and to report its recommendations, if any, to the Deputy Director within 180 days after initiating it.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 689.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Pending proposals and awards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Upon learning of alleged research misconduct OIG will identify potentially implicated awards or proposals and when appropriate, will ensure that program, grant, and contracting officers handling them are informed (subject to § 689.6(c)).</P>

            <P>(b) Neither a suspicion or allegation of research misconduct nor a pending inquiry or investigation will normally delay review of proposals. To avoid influencing reviews, reviewers or panelists will not be informed of allegations or of ongoing inquiries or investigations. However, if allegations, inquiries, or investigations have been rumored or publicized, the responsible Program Director may consult with OIG and, after further consultation <PRTPAGE P="221"/>with the Office of General Counsel, either defer review, inform reviewers to disregard the matter, or inform reviewers of the status of the matter.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 689.8</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Interim administrative actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) After an inquiry or during an external or NSF investigation the Deputy Director may order that interim actions (as described in § 689.3(c)) be taken to protect Federal resources or to guard against continuation of any suspected or alleged research misconduct. Such an order will normally be issued on recommendation from OIG and in consultation with the Division of Contracts, Policy, and Oversight or Division of Grants and Agreements, the Office of the General Counsel, the responsible Directorate, and other parts of the Foundation as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(b) When suspension is determined to be appropriate, the case will be referred to the suspending official pursuant to 2 CFR part 180, and the suspension procedures of 2 CFR part 180 will be followed, but the suspending official will be either the Deputy Director or an official designated by the Deputy Director.</P>
            <P>(c) Such interim actions may be taken whenever information developed during an investigation indicates a need to do so. Any interim action will be reviewed periodically during an investigation by NSF and modified as warranted. An interested party may request a review or modification by the Deputy Director of any interim action.</P>
            <P>(d) The Deputy Director will make and OIG will retain a record of interim actions taken and the reasons for taking them.</P>
            <P>(e) Interim administrative actions are not final agency actions subject to appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Dispositions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) After receiving a report from an external investigation by an awardee institution or another Federal agency, OIG will assess the accuracy and completeness of the report and whether the investigating entity followed reasonable procedures. It will either recommend adoption of the findings in whole or in part or, normally within 30 days, initiate a new investigation.</P>
            <P>(b) When any satisfactory external investigation or an NSF investigation fails to confirm alleged misconduct—</P>
            <P>(1) OIG will notify the subject of the investigation and, if appropriate, those who reported the suspected or alleged misconduct. This notification may include the investigation report.</P>
            <P>(2) Any interim administrative restrictions that were imposed will be lifted.</P>
            <P>(c) When any satisfactory investigation confirms misconduct. (1) In cases in which debarment is considered by OIG to be an appropriate disposition, the case will be referred to the debarring official pursuant to 2 CFR part 180 and the procedures of 2 CFR part 180 will be followed, but:</P>
            <P>(i) The debarring official will be either the Deputy Director, or an official designated by the Deputy Director.</P>
            <P>(ii) Except in unusual circumstances, the investigation report and recommended disposition will be included among the materials provided to the subject of the investigation as part of the notice of proposed debarment.</P>
            <P>(iii) The notice of the debarring official's decision will include instructions on how to pursue an appeal to the Director.</P>
            <P>(2) In all other cases—</P>
            <P>(i) Except in unusual circumstances, the investigation report will be provided by OIG to the subject of the investigation, who will be invited to submit comments or rebuttal. Comments or rebuttal submitted within the period allowed, normally 30 days, will receive full consideration and may lead to revision of the report or of a recommended disposition.</P>

            <P>(ii) Normally within 45 days after completing an NSF investigation or receiving the report from a satisfactory external investigation, OIG will submit to the Deputy Director the investigation report, any comments or rebuttal from the subject of the investigation, and a recommended disposition. The recommended disposition will propose any final actions to be taken by NSF. Section 689.3 lists possible final actions and considerations to be used in determining them.<PRTPAGE P="222"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) The Deputy Director will review the investigation report and OIG's recommended disposition. Before issuing a disposition the Deputy Director may initiate further hearings or investigation. Normally within 120 days after receiving OIG's recommendations or after completion of any further proceedings, the Deputy Director will send the affected individual or institution a written disposition, specifying actions to be taken. The decision will include instructions on how to pursue an appeal to the Director.</P>
            <CITA>[67 FR 11937, Mar. 18, 2002, as amended at 72 FR 4944, Feb. 2, 2007]</CITA>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An affected individual or institution may appeal to the Director in writing within 30 days after receiving the Deputy Director's written decision. The Deputy Director's decision becomes a final administrative action if it is not appealed within the 30 day period.</P>
            <P>(b) The Director may appoint an uninvolved NSF officer or employee to review an appeal and make recommendations.</P>
            <P>(c) The Director will normally inform the appellant of a final decision within 60 days after receiving the appeal. That decision will be the final administrative action of the Foundation</P>

            <P>(a) Except as detailed in § 690.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.</P>
            <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>62</SU>

            <P>(d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.</P>
            <P>(e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
            <P>(f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
            <P>(g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.</P>

            <P>(h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.</P>
            <P>(i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>63</SU>

              <FTREF/> Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 690.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided <PRTPAGE P="227"/>in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 690.103(d)).</P>
            <P>(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.</P>
            <P>(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.</P>
            <P>(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 690.101(i) or exempted under § 690.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.</P>

            <P>(e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this policy (or exempt research for which limited IRB review takes place pursuant to § 690.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8)) that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in a written agreement between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research protocol).</P>

Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.</P>
            <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:</P>

            <P>(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment <PRTPAGE P="228"/>of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</P>
            <P>(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
            <P>(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 690.111(a)(7).</P>
            <P>(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
            <P>(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
            <P>(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
            <P>(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 690.111(a)(7).</P>
            <P>(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.</P>
            <P>(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
            <P>(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;</P>

            <P>(ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;<PRTPAGE P="229"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and <PRTPAGE P="232"/>amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;</P>
            <P>(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 690.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).</P>
            <P>(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 690.108(b).</P>
            <P>(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.</P>
            <P>(d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria for IRB approval of research.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
            <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:</P>
            <P>(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>

            <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>
            <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</P>
            <P>(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 690.116.</P>
            <P>(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 690.117.</P>
            <P>(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</P>
            <P>(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>

            <P>(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to <PRTPAGE P="233"/>protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
            <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 690.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:</P>
            <P>(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 690.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);</P>
            <P>(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 690.117; and</P>
            <P>(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
            <P>(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.</P>

Waiver or alteration of consent in research involving public benefit and service programs conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local officials is described in paragraph (e) of this section. General waiver or alteration of informed consent is described in paragraph (f) of this section. Except as provided elsewhere in this policy:</P>
            <P>(1) Before involving a human subject in research covered by this policy, an investigator shall obtain the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>
            <P>(2) An investigator shall seek informed consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the legally authorized representative sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.</P>
            <P>(3) The information that is given to the subject or the legally authorized representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the legally authorized representative.</P>
            <P>(4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.</P>
            <P>(5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:</P>

            <P>(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed <PRTPAGE P="235"/>consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.</P>
            <P>(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.</P>
            <P>(6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic elements of informed consent.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, in seeking informed consent the following information shall be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:</P>

            <P>(5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;</P>
            <P>(6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained;</P>
            <P>(7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Documentation of informed consent.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 690.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>
            <P>(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 690.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 690.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:</P>

            <P>(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the <PRTPAGE P="239"/>informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;</P>
            <P>(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or</P>
            <P>(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.</P>
            <P>(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.</P>

            <P>Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are submitted to Federal departments or agencies with the knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. Except for research waived under § 690.101(i) or exempted under § 690.104, no human subjects may be involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification submitted, by the institution, to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research.</P>

The predecessor agency to the present Commission was established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 71 Stat. 634. This Act was amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1960, 74 Stat. 86; the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241; by 81 Stat. 582 (1967); by 84 Stat. 1356 (1970); by 86 Stat. 813 (1972); and by the Civil Rights Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 1067. The present Commission was established by the United States Commission on Civil Rights Act of 1983, 97 Stat. 1301, as amended by the Civil Rights Commission Amendments Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4339. The statutes are codified in 42 U.S.C. 1975 through 1975d. (Hereinafter, the 1994 Act will be referred to as “the Act.”)</P>

            <P>(A) Shall clearly and prominently be identified as a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act (if submitted by mail or otherwise submitted in an envelope or other cover, be clearly and prominently identified as such on the envelope or other cover—<E T="03">e.g.,</E> FOIA); and</P>
            <P>(B) Shall contain a sufficiently specific description of the record requested with respect to names, dates, and subject matter to permit such record to be identified and located; and</P>
            <P>(C) Shall contain a statement that whatever costs involved pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section will be paid, that such costs will be paid up to a specified amount, or that waiver or reduction of fees is requested pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section is insufficient to enable identification and location of the records, the General Counsel shall as soon as possible notify the requester in writing indicating the additional information needed. Every reasonable effort shall be made to assist in the identification and location of the record sought. Time requirements under the regulations in this part are tolled from the date notification under this section is sent to the requester until an answer in writing to such notification is received from requester.</P>
            <P>(iii) A request for records that is not in writing or does not comply with paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section is not a request under the Freedom of Information Act and the 10 day time limit for agency response under the Act will not be deemed applicable.</P>
            <P>(iv) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the General Counsel shall immediately notify the requester of noncompliance with paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(C) and (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Agency determinations.</E> (i) Responses to all requests pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) shall be made by the General Counsel in writing to the requester within 10 working days after receipt by the General Counsel of such request except as specifically exempted under paragraphs (d)(1) (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section, and shall state:</P>
            <P>(A) Whether and to what extent the Commission will comply with the request;</P>
            <P>(B) The probable availability of the records or that the records may be furnished with deletions or that records will be denied as exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) through (9);</P>
            <P>(C) The estimated costs, determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, including waiver or reduction of fee as appropriate and any deposit or prepayment requirement; and</P>
            <P>(D) When records are to be provided, the time and place at which records or copies will be available determined in accordance with the terms of the request and with paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Such response shall be termed a determination notice.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of denial of requests in whole or part the determination notice shall state:</P>
            <P>(A) Specifically what records are being denied;</P>
            <P>(B) The reasons for such denials;</P>
            <P>(C) The specific statutory exemption(s) upon which such denial is based;</P>
            <P>(D) The names and titles or positions of every person responsible for the denial of such request; and</P>
            <P>(E) The right of appeal to the Staff Director of the Commission and procedures for such appeal as provided under paragraph (g) of this section.</P>

            <P>(iii) Each request received by the Office of the General Counsel for records pursuant to the regulations in this part <PRTPAGE P="260"/>shall be recorded immediately. The record of each request shall be kept current, stating the date and time the request is received, the name and address of the person making the request, any amendments to such request, the nature of the records requested, the action taken regarding the request, including waiver of fees, extensions of time pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), and appeals. The date and subject of any letters pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section or agency determinations pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the date(s) any records are subsequently furnished, and the payment requested and received.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time limitations.</E> (i) Time limitations for agency response to a request for records established by the regulations in this part shall begin when the request is recorded pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. A written request pursuant to FOIA but sent to an office of the Commission other than the Office of the General Counsel shall be date stamped, initialed, and redirected immediately to the Office of the General Counsel. The required period for agency determination shall begin when it is received by the Office of the General Counsel in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) In unusual circumstances, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), the General Counsel may, in the case of initial determinations under the regulations in this part, extend the 10 working day time limit in which the agency is required to make its determination notification. Such extension shall be communicated in writing to the requesting party setting forth with particularity the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be transmitted. Such extensions may not exceed 10 working days for any request and may only be used to the extent necessary to properly process a particular request. Such extension is permissible only where there is a demonstrated need:</P>
            <P>(A) To search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the Office of the General Counsel;</P>
            <P>(B) To search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; or</P>
            <P>(C) For consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the same agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to the terms when used in this section:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures that the Commission actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a request made under paragraph (d) of this section. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee(s) performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee(s) plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Search</E> means all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification within documents. However, an entire document will be duplicated if this would prove to be a more efficient and less expensive method of complying with a request than a more detailed manner of searching. Search is distinguished from review of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a request for disclosure of records. Such copies can take the form of paper or machine readable documentation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> magnetic tape or disk), among others.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining documents located in response to an information request to determine whether any portion of any document is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> doing all that is necessary to prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues <PRTPAGE P="261"/>regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(v) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In deciding whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the General Counsel will determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. When the General Counsel has reasonable cause to doubt such intended use, or where such use is not clear from the request itself, the General Counsel will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a school, an institution of higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(viii) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. News media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. Freelance journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Costs to be included in fees.</E> The direct costs included in fees will vary according to the following categories of requests:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Commercial use requests.</E> Fees will include the Commission's direct costs for searching for, reviewing, and duplicating the requested records.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requests.</E> The Commission will provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a noncommercial scientific institution) research.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requests from representatives of the news media.</E> The Commission will provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category a requester must meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(1)(viii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">All other requests.</E> The Commission will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section fees that cover the direct costs of searching for and duplicating records that are responsive to the requests, except for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages duplicated. However, requests from persons for records about themselves will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and § 705.10 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Fee calculation.</E> Fees will be calculated as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Manual search.</E> At the salary rate (basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Computer search.</E> At the actual direct cost of providing the search, including computer search time directly attributable to search for records responsive to the request, runs, and operator salary apportionable to the search.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Review</E> (commercial use requests only). At the salary rate (basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review. Only the review necessary at the initial administrative <PRTPAGE P="262"/>level to determine the applicability of any exemption, and not review at the administrative appeal level, will be included in the fee.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> At 20 cents per page for paper copy. For copies of records prepared by computer (such as tapes or printouts), the actual cost of production, including operator time, will be charged.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Additional services; certification.</E> Express mail and other additional services that may be arranged by the requester will be charged at actual cost. The fee for certification or authentication of copies shall be $3.00 per document.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Assessment of interest.</E> The Commission may begin assessing interest charges on the 31st day following the day the fee bill is sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of billing.</P>
            <P>(vii) No fee shall be charged if the total billable cost calculated under paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section is less than $10.00.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (i) Documents will be furnished without charge, or at a reduced charge, where disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(ii) Whenever a waiver or reduction of fees is granted, only one copy of the record will be furnished.</P>
            <P>(iii) The decision of the General Counsel on any fee waiver or reduction request shall be final and unappealable.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Payment procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">Fee payment.</E> Payment of fees shall be made by cash (if delivered in person), check, or money order payable to the United States Commission on Civil Rights.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Notification of fees.</E> No work shall be done that will result in fees in excess of $25.00 without written authorization from the requester. Where it is anticipated that fees will exceed $25.00, and the requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requester will be notified of the amount of the projected fees. The notification shall offer the requester an opportunity to confer with the General Counsel in an attempt to reformulate the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. The administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will not begin until after the requester agrees in writing to accept the prospective charges.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Advance payment of fees.</E> When fees are projected to exceed $250.00, the requester may be required to make an advance payment of all or part of the fee before the request is processed. If a requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> within 30 days of the billing date), the requester will be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before a new or pending request is processed from that requester. The administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will not begin until after the requester has complied with this provision.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Other provisions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful search.</E> Charges may be assessed for time spent searching for requested records, even if the search fails to locate responsive records or the records are determined, after review, to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Aggregating requests to avoid fees.</E> Multiple requests shall be aggregated when the General Counsel reasonably determines that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break down a request into a series of requests to evade fees.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.</E> The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, will be used to encourage payment where appropriate.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemptions</E> (5 U.S.C. 552(b))-(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Commission may exempt from disclosure matters that are:</P>
            <P>(i)(A) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and</P>

            <P>(B) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.<PRTPAGE P="263"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</P>
            <P>(iii) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;</P>
            <P>(iv) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(v) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;</P>
            <P>(vi) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(vii) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
            <P>(A) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
            <P>(B) Could deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
            <P>(C) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(D) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis;</P>
            <P>(E) Could disclose techniques and procedures for all enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or could disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
            <P>(F) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;</P>
            <P>(viii) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; and</P>

            <P>(2) Investigatory records or information. (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)).</P>
            <P>(i) Among the documents exempt from disclosure pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section shall be records or information reflecting investigations that either are conducted for the purpose of determining whether a violation(s) of legal right has taken place, or have disclosed that a violation(s) of legal right has taken place, but only to the extent that production of such records or information would fall within the classifications established in paragraphs (f)(1)(vii)(B) through (F) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Among the documents exempt from disclosure under paragraphs(f)(1)(vii)(D) and (f)(2)(i) of this section concerning confidential sources shall be documents that disclose the fact or the substance of a communication made to the Commission in confidence relating to an allegation or support of an allegation of wrongdoing by certain persons. It is sufficient under this section to indicate the confidentiality of the source if the substance of the communication or the circumstances of the communication indicate that investigative effectiveness could reasonably be expected to be inhibited by disclosure.</P>
            <P>(iii) Whenever a request is made that involves access to records described in paragraph (f)(1)(vii)(A) of this section and the investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law and there is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency and disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Commission may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 and this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions that are exempt under this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Administrative appeals.</E> (1) These procedures apply whenever a requester is denied records under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) Parties may appeal decisions under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section <PRTPAGE P="264"/>within 90 days of the date of such decision by filing a written request for review addressed to the Staff Director, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 624 9th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20425, by certified mail, including a copy of the written denial, and may include a statement of the circumstances, reasons or arguments advanced in support of disclosure. Review will be made by the Staff Director on the basis of the written record.</P>
            <P>(3) The decision on review of any appeal filed under this section shall be in writing over the signature of the Staff Director will be promptly communicated to the person requesting review and will constitute the final action of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(4) Determinations of appeals filed under this section shall be made within 20 working days after the receipt of such appeal. If, on appeal, denial of records is in whole or part upheld, the Staff Director shall notify the persons making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6).</P>
            <P>(5) An extension of time may be granted under this section pursuant to criteria established in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) (A) through (C) of this section, except that such extension together with any extension, which may have been granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, may not exceed a total of 10 working days.</P>

            <P>(a) An individual seeking notification of whether a system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her or an individual seeking access to information or records pertaining to him or her, that are available under the Privacy Act of 1974, shall present his or her request in person or in writing to the General Counsel of the Commission.</P>

If possible, that description should include the nature of the records sought, the approximate dates covered by the record, and, if known by the requester, the system in which the record is thought to be included. Requested information that is not identified by a reasonably specific description is not an identifiable record, and the request for that information cannot be treated as a formal request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Under the provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), it has been determined by the agency that the following exemptions are necessary and proper and may be asserted by the agency:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemption (k)(2) of the Act.</E> Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of the Privacy Act: Provided, however, That if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit that he or she would otherwise be eligible for, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such material shall be provided to such individual, except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to [the effective date of this section], under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemption (k)(4) of the Act.</E> Statistical personnel records that are used only to generate aggregate data or for other evaluative or analytical purposes and that are not used to make decisions on the rights, benefits, or entitlements of individuals.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Exemption (k)(5) of the Act.</E> Investigatory material maintained solely for the purposes of determining an individual's qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for employment in the Federal civilian service, Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the extent that disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of the source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Exemption (k)(6) of the Act.</E> Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for promotion or appointment in the Federal service the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process.</P>
            <P>(b) Following are Commission systems of records that are partially exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), (4), (5), and (6) and the reasons for such exemptions:</P>
            <P>(1) Appeals, Grievances, and Complaints (staff)—Commission Project, CRC-001. Exempt partially under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The reasons for possibly asserting the exemptions are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources.</P>

            <P>(2) Complaints, CRC-003—Exempt partially under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The reasons for possibly asserting the exemptions are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources.<PRTPAGE P="270"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Commission projects, CRC-004—Partially exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The reasons for asserting the exemptions are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources.</P>
            <P>(4) Other Employee Programs: EEO, Troubled Employee, and Upward Mobility, CRC-006—Partially exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4), (5), and (6). The reasons for asserting the exemptions are to maintain the ability to obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality of information, to avoid endangering these sources and, primarily, to facilitate proper selection or continuance of the best applicants or persons for a given position.</P>
            <P>(5) State Advisory Committees Projects, CRC-009—Partially exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The reasons for possibly asserting the exemptions are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Accounting of the disclosures of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All disclosures of records covered by this part, except for the exemptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, shall be accounted for by keeping a written record of the particular record disclosed, the name and address of the person or agency to whom or to which disclosed, and the date, nature, and purpose of the disclosure.</P>
            <P>(b) No accounting is required for disclosures of records to those officials and employees of the Commission who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties or if disclosure would be required under the Freedom of Information Act. 5 U.S.C. 552.</P>
            <P>(c) The accounting shall be maintained for 5 years or until the record is destroyed or transferred to the National Archives and Records Administrator for storage, in which event, the accounting pertaining to those records, unless maintained separately, shall be transferred with the records themselves.</P>
            <P>(d) The accounting of disclosures may be recorded in any system the Commission determines is sufficient for this purpose, however, the Commission must be able to construct from its system a listing of all disclosures. The system of accounting of disclosures is not a system of records under the definition in § 705.2(e) and no accounting need be maintained for disclosure of the accounting of disclosures.</P>
            <P>(e) Upon request of an individual to whom a record pertains, the accounting of the disclosures of that record shall be made available to the requester, provided that he or she has complied with § 705.3(a) and with § 705.4(c) or (d).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Physical access.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Discrimination prohibited.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the Agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Agency.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Existing facilities-program access</E>—(1) <E T="03">Existing facilities defined.</E> For the purpose of this section, existing facilities means those facilities owned, leased or used through some other arrangement by the Agency on March 28, 1990.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">General.</E> The Agency shall operate each program or activity conducted in an existing facility so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(i) Necessarily require the Agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities</P>
            <P>(ii) Require the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this paragraph would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director or his or her designee after considering all Agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Methods.</E> (i) The Agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to individuals with disabilities, delivery of services at alternative accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible vehicles, or any other methods that result in making its program or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The Agency, in making alterations to existing buildings to achieve program accessibility, shall meet accessibility requirements imposed by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157,</P>
            <P>(iii) In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The Agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section before April 17, 1990, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made before February 16, 1993, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Agency shall develop, before August 16, 1990, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The Agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with disabilities and organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made <PRTPAGE P="275"/>available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(i) Identify physical obstacles in the Agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with disabilities;</P>
            <P>(ii) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this paragraph and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Indicate the official response for implementation of the plan.</P>
            <P>(6) The Agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">New purchases, leases, or other arrangements.</E> (1) Any building or facility acquired after March 28, 1990, whether by purchase, lease (other than lease renewal), or any other arrangement, shall be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>(2) Nothing in this paragraph requires the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this paragraph would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director or his or her designee after considering all Agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(d) New construction and alterations. Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities in accordance with the requirements imposed by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Access to communications.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Discrimination prohibited. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the Agency's communications are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Agency.</P>
            <P>(b) The Agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
            <P>(c) Specific requirements regarding oral communications—(1) Telecommunications devices for deaf persons. (i) The Agency headquarters and each regional office shall maintain and reliably answer at least one telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD) or equally effective telecommunications device.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Agency shall ensure that all Agency letterhead, forms, and other documents listing any Agency telephone number list the appropriate TDD numbers.</P>
            <P>(2) Interpreter service. (i) The Agency shall establish a reliable system for the provision of qualified interpreters to individuals with disabilities for Agency programs or activities. This provision does not require the Agency to have an interpreter on staff, but does require the Agency to be able to provide a qualified interpreter on reasonable notice.</P>

            <P>(ii) Notice of the availability of interpreter service shall be included in <PRTPAGE P="276"/>all announcements notifying the public of Agency activities to which the public is invited or which it is permitted to attend, including but not limited to the Commission's meetings, consultations, hearings, press conferences, and State Advisory Committee conferences and meetings. This notice shall designate the Agency official(s) and the address, telephone and TDD number to call to request interpreter services.</P>
            <P>(d) Specific requirements for printed communications. (1) The Agency shall establish a system to provide to individuals with disabilities appropriate reader or taping service for all Agency publications that are available to the public. This provision does not require the Agency to have a reader or taper on staff, but does require the Agency to be able to provide appropriate reader or taping service within a reasonable time and on reasonable notice. The Agency shall effectively notify qualified individuals with disabilities of the availability of reader or taping services.</P>
            <P>(2) Notice of the availability of reader or taping service shall be included in all publications that are available to the public. This notice shall designate the Agency official(s) and the address, telephone, and TDD number to call to request interpreter services.</P>
            <P>(e) Nothing in this section or § 707.10 requires the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this section or § 707.10 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director or his or her designee after considering all Agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this paragraph would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(b) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with disabilities.</P>

            <P>The Agency shall not make use of any qualification standard, eligibility requirement, or selection criterion that excludes particular classes of individuals with disabilities from an Agency program or activity merely because the persons are disabled, without regard to an individual's actual ability to participate. An irrebuttable presumption of inability to participate based upon a disability shall be permissible only if the condition would, in all instances, prevent an individual from meeting the essential eligibility requirements for participating in, or receiving the benefits of, the particular program or activity.</P>

            <P>(d) The Agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The Agency may extend this time period for good cause.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity.</P>

            <P>(c) The Commission shall except from salary offset provisions any adjustments to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits programs requiring periodic payroll deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.</P>
            <P>(d) These procedures do not preclude an employee or former employee from requesting a waiver of a salary overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 10 U.S.C. 2774 or in any way questioning the amount or validity of the debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office (GAO) in accordance with procedures prescribed by the GAO. In addition, this procedure does not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions applicable to the particular debt being collected.</P>

The written consent or acknowledgement must be sent to the paying agency;</P>
            <P>(5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission will submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part.

            <P>(6) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the Assistant Staff Director for Management may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset. The Commission will provide the agency responsible for these payments with a properly certified claim.</P>

One copy of this certification must be furnished to the employee. The creditor agency will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed.</P>
            <P>(5) When the Commission, as a paying agency, receives an incomplete debt claim from a creditor agency, it must return the debt claim with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart must be provided and a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method and in the amount stated in the Assistant Staff Director for Management's written notice of intent to collect from the employee's current pay, unless alternative arrangements for repayment are made.</P>
            <P>(b) If the employee filed a petition for a hearing with the Assistant Staff Director for Management before the expiration of the period provided, then deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a hearing, and a final written decision has been rendered in favor of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(c) A debt will be collected in a lump-sum if possible.</P>

            <P>(d) If an employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection must be made in installments. The size of the installment deduction(s) will bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the deduction will be established for a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The deduction for the pay intervals for any period must not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in no more than three years.<PRTPAGE P="282"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) Installment payments may be less than 15 percent of disposable pay if the Assistant Staff Director for Management determines that the 15 percent deduction would create an extreme financial hardship.</P>
            <P>(f) Installment payments of less than $25.00 per pay period or $50.00 per month, will only be accepted in the most unusual circumstances.</P>
            <P>(g) Unliquidated debts may be offset by the paying agency under 31 U.S.C. 3716 against any financial payment due to a separating employee including but not limited to final salary payment, retired pay, or lump sum leave, etc. as of the date of separation to the extent necessary to liquidate the debt.</P>
            <P>(h) If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from any final payment due a separated employee it may be recovered by the offset in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716 from any later payments due the former employee from the United States.</P>

            <P>(b) Upon receipt of monies returned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will refund the amount to the current or former employee.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Causes for OPM compliance actions.</E> The following constitute cause for OPM to impose a compliance action described in paragraph (b) of this section against an MSP issuer:</P>
              <P>(1) Failure by the MSP issuer to meet the requirements set forth in § 800.401(a) and (b);</P>
              <P>(2) An MSP issuer's sustained failure to perform the MSP Program contract in accordance with prudent business practices, as described in § 800.401(c);</P>
              <P>(3) A pattern of poor conduct or evidence of poor business practices such as those described in § 800.401(d); or</P>
              <P>(4) Such other violations of law or regulation as OPM may determine, including pursuant to its authority under §§ 800.102 and 800.114.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance actions.</E> (1) OPM may impose a compliance action against an MSP issuer at any time during the contract term if it determines that the MSP issuer is not in compliance with applicable law, this part, or the terms of its contract with OPM.</P>
              <P>(2) Compliance actions may include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Establishment and implementation of a corrective action plan;</P>

              <P>(viii) Withdrawal of approval or termination of the MSP Program contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of compliance action.</E> (1) OPM must notify an MSP issuer in writing of a compliance action under this section. Such notice must indicate the specific compliance action undertaken and the reason for the compliance action.</P>

              <P>(2) For compliance actions listed in § 800.404(b)(2)(v) through (viii), such notice must include a statement that the <PRTPAGE P="299"/>MSP issuer is entitled to request a reconsideration of OPM's determination to impose a compliance action pursuant to § 800.405.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon imposition of a compliance action listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) through (vii) of this section, OPM must notify the State Insurance Commissioner(s) and Exchange officials in the State or States in which the compliance action is effective.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to enrollees.</E> If the contract is terminated, if OPM withdraws certification of an MSP option, or if a State-level issuer's participation in the MSP Program contract is not renewed, as described in §§ 800.306 and 800.404(b)(2), or in any situation in which an MSP option is no longer available to enrollees, the MSP issuer must comply with any State or Exchange requirements regarding discontinuing a particular type of coverage that are applicable to a QHP offered on the Exchange on which the MSP option was offered, including a requirement to provide advance written notice before the coverage will be discontinued. If a State or Exchange does not have requirements about advance notice to enrollees, the MSP issuer must inform current MSP enrollees in writing of the discontinuance of the MSP option no later than 90 days prior to discontinuing the MSP option, unless OPM determines that there is good cause for less than 90 days' notice.</P>
              <P>(e)<E T="03"> Definition.</E> As used in this subpart, “termination” means a decision by OPM to cancel an MSP Program contract prior to the end of its contract term. The term includes OPM's withdrawal of approval of an MSP Program contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reconsideration of compliance actions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Right to request reconsideration.</E> An MSP issuer may request that OPM reconsider a determination to impose one of the following compliance actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Withdrawal of the certification of the MSP option or options offered on one or more Exchanges;</P>
              <P>(2) Nonrenewal of participation</P>
              <P>(3) Nonrenewal of contract; or</P>
              <P>(4) Termination of the MSP Program contract.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for reconsideration and/or hearing.</E> (1) An MSP issuer with a right to request reconsideration specified in paragraph (a) of this section may request a hearing in which OPM will reconsider its determination to impose a compliance action.</P>
              <P>(2) A request under this section must be in writing and contain contact information, including the name, telephone number, email address, and mailing address of the person or persons whom OPM may contact regarding a request for a hearing with respect to the reconsideration. The request must be in such form, contain such information, and be submitted in such manner as OPM may prescribe.</P>
              <P>(3) The request must be received by OPM within 15 calendar days after the date of the MSP issuer's receipt of the notice of compliance action. The MSP issuer may request that OPM's reconsideration allow a representative of the MSP issuer to appear personally before OPM.</P>
              <P>(4) A request under this section must include a detailed statement of the reasons that the MSP issuer disagrees with OPM's imposition of the compliance action, and may include any additional information that will assist OPM in rendering a final decision under this section.</P>
              <P>(5) OPM may obtain additional information relevant to the request from any source as it may, in its judgment, deem necessary. OPM will provide the MSP issuer with a copy of any additional information it obtains and provide an opportunity for the MSP issuer to respond (including by submitting additional information or explanation).</P>
              <P>(6) OPM's reconsideration and hearing, if requested, may be conducted by the Director or a representative designated by the Director who did not participate in the initial decision that is the subject of the request for review.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of final decision.</E> OPM will notify the MSP issuer, in writing, of OPM's final decision on the MSP issuer's request for reconsideration and the specific reasons for that final decision. OPM's written decision will constitute final agency action that is subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act in the appropriate <PRTPAGE P="300"/>U.S. district court. Such review is limited to the record that was before OPM when it made its decision.</P>

              <P>The Denali Commission was created to deliver the services of the federal government in the most cost-effective manner practicable. In order to reduce administrative and overhead costs, the Commission partners with federal, state and local agencies and Alaska Native villages and commonly depends on these governmental agencies for project management. Consequently, the Commission generally relies on the expertise and processes already in use by partnering agencies to help prepare Commission NEPA analyses and documents.</P>
              <P>(a) With federal partners, the Commission will work as either a joint lead agency (40 CFR 1501.5 and 1508.16) or cooperating agency (40 CFR 1501.6 and 1508.5). The Commission may invite other Federal agencies to serve as the lead agency, a joint lead agency, or as a cooperating agency.</P>
              <P>(b) Consistent with 40 CFR 1508.5, the Commission will typically invite Alaska Native villages and state and local government partners to serve as cooperating agencies.</P>
              <P>(c) Requests for the Commission to serve as a lead agency (40 CFR 1501.5(d)), for CEQ to determine which Federal agency shall be the lead agency (40 CFR 1501.5(e)), or for the Commission to serve as a cooperating agency (40 CFR 1501.6(a)(1)) shall be mailed to the Commission office.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emergency actions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Emergency circumstances may require immediate actions that preclude following standard NEPA processes. The Council shall limit alternative arrangements to those actions that are necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency. In the event of emergency circumstances, the Approving Official should coordinate with the Federal Co-Chair as soon as practicable. Immediate emergency actions necessary to protect the lives and safety of the public or prevent adverse impacts to ecological resources and functions should never be delayed in order to comply with these NEPA procedures. Alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance are permitted for emergency actions pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Categorical exclusion (CATEX).</E> When emergency circumstances make it necessary to determine whether an extraordinary circumstance would preclude the use of a CATEX, the Approving Official shall make the determination as soon as practicable. If an extraordinary circumstance exists, the Approving Official shall comply with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Environmental assessment (EA).</E> When emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action that requires an EA before the EA can be completed, the Approving Official will consult with the Federal Co-Chair to develop alternative arrangements to meet the requirements of these NEPA implementing procedures and CEQ Regulations pertaining to EAs. Alternative arrangements should focus on minimizing adverse environmental impacts of the proposed action and the emergency. To the maximum extent practicable, these alternative arrangements should include the content, interagency coordination, and public notification and involvement that would normally be undertaken for an EA for the action at issue and cannot alter the requirements of the CEQ Regulations at 40 CFR 1508.9(a)(1) and (b). The Federal Co-Chair may grant an alternative arrangement. Any alternative arrangement shall be documented. The Federal Co-Chair will inform CEQ of the alternative arrangements at the earliest opportunity.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</E> Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take actions with significant environmental impacts without observing other provisions of these NEPA implementing procedures and the CEQ Regulations (see 40 CFR 1506.11) the Federal Co-Chair may consult with CEQ about alternative arrangements for implementation of NEPA. In these situations, the Commission may reduce processing times or, if the emergency situation warrants, abbreviate its preparation and processing of EISs. Any request for alternative arrangements must be submitted by the Federal Co-Chair to CEQ and notice of a potential request should be provided to CEQ at the earliest opportunity. For projects undertaken by an applicant, the Approving Official will inform the Federal Co-Chair about the emergency. The Federal Co-Chair will consult CEQ requesting the alternative arrangements for complying with NEPA.</P>

              <P>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Commission may prepare a NEPA document to assist <PRTPAGE P="309"/>any Commission action at any time in order to further the purposes of NEPA. This NEPA document may be done to analyze the consequences of ongoing Commission activities, to support Commission planning, to assess the need for mitigation, to disclose fully the potential environmental consequences of Commission actions, or for any other reason.

              <SUBJECT>Categorical exclusions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A categorical exclusion (CATEX) is defined in 40 CFR 1508.4 as a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and, for which in the absence of extraordinary circumstances or sensitive resources, neither an EA nor an EIS is required. Actions that meet the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section and are listed in section A of appendix A of this part can be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EA or EIS. Actions that meet the screening conditions in paragraph (b) of this section and are listed in section B of appendix A require satisfactory completion of a Denali Commission CATEX checklist in order to be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EA or EIS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Conditions.</E> The following three conditions must be met for an action to be categorically excluded from further analysis in an EA or EIS.</P>
              <P>(1) The action has not been segmented (too narrowly defined or broken down into small parts in order minimize its potential effects and avoid a higher level of NEPA review) and its scope includes the consideration of connected actions and, when evaluating extraordinary circumstances, cumulative impacts.</P>
              <P>(2) No extraordinary circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section exist, unless resolved through other regulatory means.</P>
              <P>(3) One categorical exclusion described in either section of appendix A of this part encompasses the proposed action.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Extraordinary circumstances.</E> Any action that normally would be classified as a CATEX but could involve extraordinary circumstances will require appropriate environmental review documented in a Denali Commission CATEX checklist to determine if the CATEX classification is proper or if an EA or EIS should be prepared. Extraordinary circumstances to be considered include those likely to:</P>
              <P>(1) Have a reasonable likelihood of significant impacts on public health, public safety, or the environment;</P>
              <P>(2) Have effects on the environment that are likely to be highly controversial or involve unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources;</P>
              <P>(3) Have possible effects on the human environment that are highly uncertain, involve unique or unknown risks, or are scientifically controversial;</P>
              <P>(4) Establish a precedent for future action or represent a decision in principle about future actions with potentially significant environmental effects;</P>
              <P>(5) Relate to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant environmental effects;</P>
              <P>(6) Have a greater scope or size than is normal for the category of action;</P>
              <P>(7) Have the potential to degrade already existing poor environmental conditions or to initiate a degrading influence, activity, or effect in areas not already significantly modified from their natural condition;</P>
              <P>(8) Have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations (see Executive Order 12898);</P>
              <P>(9) Limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on federal lands by Indian religious practitioners or adversely affect the physical integrity of such sacred sites (see Executive Order 13007);</P>
              <P>(10) Threaten a violation of a federal, tribal, state or local law or requirement imposed for the protection of the environment;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(12) Have a reasonable likelihood of significant impacts on environmentally sensitive resources, such as:</P>

If there will be a lengthy period of time between the Commission's decision to prepare an EIS and its actual preparation, the Commission may defer publication of the NOI until a reasonable time before preparing the EIS, provided that the Commission allows a reasonable opportunity for interested parties to participate in the EIS process. Consistent with § 900.201(b), the Commission and the applicant will coordinate during the time period prior to the publication of the NOI to identify: the scope of the action, potential modifications to the proposal, potential alternatives, environmental constraints, potential timeframes for the environmental review, and federal, state, or tribal entities that could be interested in the project, including those with the potential to become cooperating agencies. Through the NOI, the Commission shall invite comments and suggestions on the scope of the EIS.</P>
              <P>(b) Publication of the NOI in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> shall begin the public scoping process. The public scoping process for a Commission EIS shall allow a minimum of 30 days for the receipt of public comments.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Format.</E> The EIS format recommended by 40 CFR 1502.10 shall be used unless a determination is made on a particular project that there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. In such a case, the EIS format must meet the minimum requirements prescribed in 40 CFR 1502.10, as further described in 40 CFR 1502.11 through 1502.18.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Filing.</E> After a draft or final EIS has been prepared, the Commission shall file the EIS with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA will publish a notice of availability in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.9 and 1506.10.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Draft to final EIS.</E> When a final EIS does not require substantial changes from the draft EIS, the Commission may document required changes in errata sheets, insertion <PRTPAGE P="313"/>pages, and revised sections. The Commission will then circulate such changes together with comments on the draft EIS, responses to comments, and other appropriate information as its final EIS. The Commission will not circulate the draft EIS again; however, the Commission will post the EIS on its Web site and provide the draft EIS if requested.</P>

              <P>(b) Where Commission action remains to be taken and the EIS is more than three years old, the Commission will review the EIS to determine whether it is adequate or requires supplementation.</P>
              <P>(c) The Commission shall prepare, circulate and file a supplement to an EIS in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and final EIS.

              <P>(c) Where the Commission is a cooperating agency, it may adopt the EIS of the lead agency without recirculating it when, after an independent review of the EIS, the Commission concludes that its comments and suggestions have been satisfied.</P>
              <P>(d) When the Commission adopts an EIS which is not final within the agency that prepared it, or when the action it assesses is the subject of a referral under 40 CFR part 1504, or when the EIS's adequacy is the subject of a judicial action which is not final, the Commission shall so specify.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What conditions apply to the Charitable Choice provisions of the CSBG Act?</SUBJECT>

            <P>These Charitable Choice provisions apply whenever the Federal government, or a State or local government, uses funds under the CSBG Act to provide awards, contracts, or other assistance under any program authorized in the Community Services Block Grant, 42 U.S.C. 9901, <E T="03">et seq.</E> Additionally, these provisions apply whenever an intermediate organization acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with a Federal, State, or local government entity selects nongovernmental organizations to provide assistance under any of the programs authorized under the Community Services Block Grant Act.</P>
            <P>(a)(1) Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in the applicable programs as long as they use program funds consistent with the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</P>
            <P>(2) Neither the Federal government nor a State or local government receiving funds under an applicable program shall discriminate against an organization that applies to provide, or provides, services or benefits on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation.</P>
            <P>(b) No program participant that receives direct funding under an applicable program may expend the program funds for inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. If an organization conducts such activities, it must offer them separately, in time or location, from the programs or services directly funded under any applicable program, and participation must be voluntary for program beneficiaries.</P>

            <P>(c) A religious organization that participates in an applicable program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and local governments and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not expend any direct funding under the applicable program to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, religious organizations may use space in their facilities to provide services funded under an applicable program without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols. In addition, such a religious organization retains the authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's <PRTPAGE P="319"/>mission statements and other governing documents.</P>
            <P>(d) The participation of a religious organization in, or its receipt of funds from, an applicable program does not affect that organization's exemption provided under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1 regarding employment practices.</P>
            <P>(e) A religious organization that receives funds under an applicable program, shall not, in providing program services or benefits, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion or a religious belief.</P>
            <P>(f) Religious organizations that receive funds under an applicable program are subject to the same regulations as other nongovernmental organizations to account, in accordance with generally accepted auditing and accounting principles, for the use of such funds. In addition, religious organizations are required to keep any Federal funds they receive for services segregated in a separate account from non-Federal funds. Only the segregated government funds are subject to audit by the government under the applicable program.</P>
            <P>(g) If a State or local government contributes its own funds to supplement CSBG Act funded activities, the State or local government has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, the Charitable Choice provisions apply to all of the commingled funds.</P>
            <P>(h) If a nongovernmental pass-through entity, acting under a grant, contract, or other agreement with the Federal, State or local government, is given the authority to select nongovernmental organizations to provide services under an applicable program, then the intermediate organization must ensure that the service provider complies with these Charitable Choice provisions and 45 CFR 87.1 and 87.3(i) through (l). The pass-through entity retains all other rights of a nongovernmental organization under the Charitable Choice provisions.</P>

Acceptance of the Community Services Block Grant application by the Office of Community Services will constitute approval of an award of funds under this section.</P>

            <P>(c) Funds allocated under this section shall be allotted to an Indian tribe in an amount that bears the same ratio to all the funds allocated under this section as the tribe's poverty population bears to the total poverty population of all tribes funded under this section, except that no tribe shall receive an amount of less than:<PRTPAGE P="322"/>

            <P>(d) For purposes of this section, an Indian tribe's poverty population shall be calculated by multiplying the tribe's overall population by the Indian rural poverty rate for the State in which it is located, using the population and rural poverty rate figures established for the purposes of making direct grants under section 674(c) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9903(c)).</P>

            <P>(b) Such annual report shall provide information on the use of funds to defray State administrative costs, including the types of activities which specifically address services to the homeless and also those activities that are related to the administrative costs associated with the coordination and integration of services to the homeless.</P>
            <P>(c) States shall also provide information in the annual report which details programs, progress, and activities that are specifically related to expenditures for renovation, including the effects of such activities on historic properties, and the provision of, or referral to, services for domestic violence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Agency procedures for handling requests for documents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon receiving a request for documents in accordance with the rules of this part, the General Counsel or respective Assistant General Counsel serving as the Freedom of Information Act Officer of the National Endowment for the Arts shall determine whether or not the request shall be granted in whole or in part.</P>
              <P>(1) The determination shall be made within ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after receipt of such request.</P>

              <P>(2) The requestor shall be notified of the determination and the reasons that support it. When a request is denied in whole or in part, the requestor, will be notified of his or her rights to appeal <PRTPAGE P="327"/>the determination to the head of the agency.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Any party whose request for documents has been denied in whole or in part may file an appeal no later than ten (10) working days following receipt of the notification of denial.

              <P>(c) In unusual circumstances, the time limits prescribed to determine a request for documents with respect to initial actions or actions on appeal may be extended by written notice from the General Counsel or respective Assistant General Counsel serving as the Freedom of Information Act Officer of the National Endowment for the Arts. The notice shall describe the reason for the extension and the date on which the determination is expected to be made.

              <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Categories of fees.</E> Fees will be charged according to the Category of the FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requests.</E> The agency will assess charges to recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating the requested document. The agency may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific institutions.</E> The agency will charge for duplication costs. To qualify for this category the requestor must show: (i) That requested records are being sought under the auspices of a qualified institution as defined in § 1100.1 (e) or (f) of this part; (ii) the records are not sought for commercial use; and (iii) the records are being sought in furtherance of scholarly or scientific research of the institution.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Requests by representatives of the news media.</E> The agency will charge duplication costs for the requests in this category.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requests.</E> All other requests shall be charged fees which, recover the full reasonable cost for searching for and duplicating the requested records.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General fee schedule.</E> The agency shall use the most efficient and least costly method to comply with requests for documents made under the FOIA. The agency will charge fees to recover all allowable direct costs incurred. The agency may charge fees for searching for and reviewing requested documents even if the documents are determined to be exempt from disclosure or cannot be located. If search charges are likely to exceed $25, the agency shall notify the requestor, unless the requestor has indicated in advance the willingness to pay higher fees. The following fees shall be charged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Searches</E>—(i) <E T="03">Manual.</E> The fee charged will be the salary rate(s) (i.e., <PRTPAGE P="328"/>basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the search.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Computer.</E> The fee charged will be the actual direct cost of providing the service including the cost of operating the central processing unit for the operating time that is directly attributed to searching for records responsive to a request and the operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Review.</E> The fee charged will equal the salary rate(s) (basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> Copies of documents photocopied on one-side of a 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 inch sheet of paper will be provided at $.10 per page. Photocopies on two sides of a single 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 inch sheet of paper will be provided at $.20 per page. For duplication of other materials, the charge will be the direct cost of duplication.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) Except for documents provided in response to a commercial use request, the first 100 pages of duplication or the first two (2) hours of search time shall be provided at no charge. For the purposes of this section, two (2) hours of search time by computer entitles the requestor to two (2) hours of computer operator salary translated into computer search costs. Computer search costs consist of operator salary plus central proceeding unit operating time costs for the duration of the search.</P>
              <P>(2) Fees shall not be charged to any requestor, including commercial use requestors, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Documents shall be furnished without charge or at reduced charge if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.</P>
              <P>(2) The following factors shall be used to determine whether a fee will be waived or reduced:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">The subject of the request.</E> Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government”;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">The informative value of the information to be disclosed.</E> Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure.</E> Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding”;</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">The significance of the contribution to public understanding.</E> Whether disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest.</E> Whether the requestor has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the disclosure; and if so</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">The primary interest in disclosure.</E> Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Assessment and collection of fees.</E> (1) Interest will accrue from the date the bill is mailed if the fee is not paid within thirty (30) days. Interest will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
              <P>(2) If the agency reasonably believes that a requestor(s) is making multiple requests to avoid the assessment of fees, the agency may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
              <P>(3) The agency may request an advance payment of the fee if</P>
              <P>(i) The allowable charges are likely to exceed $250; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The requestor has failed previously to pay a fee in a timely fashion.</P>
              <P>(4) When the agency requests an advance payment, the time limits prescribed in section (a)(6) of the Freedom of Information Act will begin only after the agency has received full payment.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the “Act”), 42 U.S.C. 2000d <E T="03">et seq.</E>, to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, or the <PRTPAGE P="330"/>Institute of Museum and Library Services.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application of part.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Humanities, or the Institute of Museum and Library Services, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A of this part. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of the part, including assistance pursuant to an application approved prior to such date. It also applies to federal financial assistance extended to any such program prior to the effective date of this part under a contract or grant where the term of the contract or grant continues beyond such date or where the assistance was to provide real or personal property and the recipient or his transferee continues to use or retain ownership or possession of the property (see § 1110.4(a)(1)). This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (b) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (c) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 1110.3. The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person in the United States shall, on grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected, to discrimination under any program to which this part applies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:</P>
              <P>(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;</P>
              <P>(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
              <P>(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
              <P>(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
              <P>(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>

              <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods <PRTPAGE P="331"/>of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
              <P>(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.</P>
              <P>(4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
              <P>(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (i) to assist such individuals through employment to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training or (ii) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of such individuals or (iii) to reduce the unemployment of such individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence needs.</P>
              <P>(2) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Executive Order 11246 or any executive order which supersedes it.</P>
              <P>(3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of the foregoing subparagraph of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Medical emergencies.</E> Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed <PRTPAGE P="332"/>to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is necessary to prevent his death or serious impairment of his health and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assurances required.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer; and any other type or form of assistance, the assurances shall be in effect for the duration of the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended to the program. The responsible Endowment official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired with Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipients shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Endowment to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Endowment official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Chairman of the Endowment concerned may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forebear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>
              <P>(3) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. (41 CFR 101-6.2)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuing Federal financial assistance.</E> Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new <PRTPAGE P="333"/>program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible Endowment official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Elementary and secondary schools.</E> The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part within the earliest practicable time and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan. In any case of continuing Federal financial assistance, the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assurances from institutions.</E> (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research, for a special training project, or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.</P>
              <P>(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Illustrative applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the activities for which Federal financial assistance is provided by the Endowments. (In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this part, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance.)</P>
              <P>(a) In a research, training, or other grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university.</P>
              <P>(b) In cases of Federal financial assistance to elementary or secondary schools, discrimination by the recipient school district in any of its elementary or secondary schools, or by the recipient private institution, in the admission of students, or in the treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In this and the following illustration the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.</P>

              <P>(c) In a training grant to a nonacademic institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an institution, discrimination is prohibited with respect to <PRTPAGE P="334"/>any educational activity, any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program.</P>
              <P>(d) Where Federal financial assistance is provided to assist in the presentation of artistic and cultural productions to the public, assurances will be required that such productions will not be presented before any audience which has been selected on a discriminatory basis.</P>
              <P>(e) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this part forbids it to accomplish directly. Thus, a State, in selecting projects to be supported through a State agency, may not base its selections on criteria which have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the Federal financial assistance as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
              <P>(f) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 1110.6(d) to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.</P>
              <P>(g) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.</P>

In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Access to sources of information.</E> Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible Endowment official or his designee during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Information to beneficiaries and participants.</E> Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, <PRTPAGE P="335"/>and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible Endowment official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 1110.4.</E> If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 1110.4 or otherwise fails to comply with that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Endowment concerned shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that such Endowment shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings <PRTPAGE P="336"/>where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Endowment official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearings, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Chairman of the Endowment concerned, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Chairman has filed with the Committee of the House and the Committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Endowment official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</P>

The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right of a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 1110.8(c) of this part and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Endowment concerned in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the responsible Endowment official unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Endowment requires that another place be selected.

              <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence entered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this Regulation with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Chairman of the Endowment concerned may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings and for the application to such hearings of rules or procedures not inconsistent with this part.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Decision by person other than the responsible Endowment official.</E> If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible Endowment official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible Endowment official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Endowment official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the responsible Endowment official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Endowment official.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions on record or review by the responsible Endowment official.</E> Whenever a record is certified to the responsible Endowment official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the responsible Endowment official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Endowment official shall be given <PRTPAGE P="338"/>in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant if any.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.</E> Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1110.9(a) a decision shall be made by the responsible Endowment official on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision of a hearing officer or responsible Endowment official shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Approval by Chairman.</E> Any final decision of a responsible Endowment official (other than the Chairman) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Chairman, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Endowment official that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Post termination proceedings.</E> (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation. (An elementary or secondary school or school system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with § 1110.3 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance, if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation which meets the requirements of § 1110.4(c), and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with this court order or plan.)</P>
              <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Endowment official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Endowment official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</P>
              <P>(3) If the responsible Endowment official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Endowment official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for notification of existence of records pertaining to individuals.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The systems of records, as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974, maintained by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities are listed annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as required by that Act. Any person who wishes to know whether a system of records contains a record pertaining to him may appear in person at the National Endowment for the Arts, Room 1338, 2401 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20506 or the National Endowment for the Humanities, Room 1000, 806 15th Street NW., Washington, DC 20506, on work days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. or by writing to the Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts or National Endowment for the Humanities, Washington, DC 20506. It is recommended that requests be made in writing, since in many cases it will take several days to ascertain whether a record exists.</P>
              <P>(b) Requests for notification of the existence of a record should specifically identify the system of records involved and should state, if the requestor is other than the individual to whom the record pertains, the relationship of the requestor to that individual. (Note that requests will not be honored by the Foundation pursuant to the Privacy Act unless made (1) by the individual to whom the record pertains, (2) by such individual's parent if the individual is a minor, or (3) by such individual's legal guardian if the individual has been declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction).</P>
              <P>(c) The Foundation will attempt to respond to a request as to whether a record exists within 10 working days from the time it receives the request or from the time any required identification is established, whichever is later.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for requests for access to or disclosure of records pertaining to an individual.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Any person may request review of records pertaining to him by appearing at the National Endowment for the Arts, Room 1338, 2401 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506, or the National Endowment for the Humanities, Room 1000, 806 15th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506 on work days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. or by writing to the Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts, or National Endowment for the Humanities, Washington, DC 20506. (See paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for identification requirements.) The request should specifically identify the systems or records involved. The Foundation will strive either to make the record available within 15 working days of the request or to inform the requestor of the need for additional identification or the tendering of fees (as <PRTPAGE P="342"/>specified in paragraph (d) of this section) within 15 working days.</P>

              <P>(b) In the case of persons making requests by appearing at the Foundation, the amount of personal identification required will of necessity vary with the sensitivity of the record involved. Except as indicated below, reasonable identification such as employment identification cards, drivers licenses, and credit cards will normally be accepted as sufficient evidence of identity in the absence of any indications to the contrary. Records in the following systems of records, however, are considered to contain relatively sensitive and/or detailed personal information—

              <P>(d) Charges for copies of records will be at the rate of $0.10 per photography of each page. Where records are not susceptible to photo-copying, e.g., punch cards, magnetic tapes or oversize materials, the amount charged will be actual cost as determined on a case-by-case basis. Only one copy of each record requested will be supplied. No charge will be made unless the charge as computed above would exceed $3.00 for each request or related series of requests. If a fee in excess of $25.00 would be required, the requestor shall be notified and the fee must be tendered before the records will be copied.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Correction of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any individual is entitled to request amendments of records pertaining to him pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Such a request shall be made in writing and addressed to the Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts or National Endowment for the Humanities, Washington, DC 20506.</P>

              <P>(b) The request should specify the record and systems of records involved, and should specify the exact correction desired and state that the request is made pursuant to the Privacy Act. An edited copy of the record showing the desired correction is desirable. Within 10 working days of the receipt of a properly addressed request (or within 10 working days of the time the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts or the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Humanities becomes aware that a particular communication not addressed as prescribed above is a request for correction of a record under the Privacy Act), the General Counsel's office shall acknowledge receipt of the request.<PRTPAGE P="343"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) The General Counsel's office upon receipt of such a request shall promptly confer with the office within the Foundation responsible for the record. In the event it is felt that correction is not warranted in whole or in part, the matter shall be brought to the attention of the Deputy Chairman of the Endowment involved. If, after review by the Deputy Chairman of the involved Endowment and discussion with the request or, if deemed helpful, it is determined that correction as requested is not warranted, a letter shall be sent by the Deputy Chairman's office to the requestor denying his request and/or explaining what correction might be made if agreeable to the requestor. This letter shall set forth the reasons for the refusal to honor the request for correction. It shall also inform him of his right to appeal this decision and include a description of the appeals procedure set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) An appeal may be taken from an adverse determination under paragraph (c) of this section to the Assistant Chairman/Management, National Endowment for the Arts or the Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities. Such appeal must be made in writing and should clearly indicate that it is an appeal. The basis for the appeal should be included, and it should be mailed to the same address as listed in paragraph (a) of this section. A hearing at the Foundation may be requested. Such hearing will be informal, and shall be before the Assistant Chairman/Management, National Endowment for the Arts, the Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities, or an appointed designee. If no hearing is requested, the request for appeal should include the basis for the appeal. Where no hearing is requested the Assistant Chairman or Chairman before whom the appeal is taken shall render his decision within thirty working days after receipt of the written appeal at the Foundation, unless the Assistant Chairman or Chairman before whom the appeal is taken, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period and the appellant is advised in writing of such extension. If a hearing is requested, the Foundation will attempt to contact the appellant within five working days and arrange a suitable time for the hearing. In such cases the decision of the Assistant Chairman or Chairman shall be made within 30 working days after the hearing unless the time is extended and the appellant is advised in writing of such extension.</P>
              <P>(e) The final decision of the Assistant Chairman or Chairman in an appeal shall be in writing, and, if adverse to the appellant, set forth the reasons for the refusal to amend the record and advise him of his right to appeal the decision under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A). The individual shall also be notified that he has the right to file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for this disagreement with the refusal of the Foundation to amend his record.</P>

These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with the Arts Endowment's Privacy Act regulations as well as under this part.</P>

              <P>Records that the Arts Endowment makes available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the Arts Endowment's open government page, available at <E T="03">https://www.arts.gov/open.</E> The Arts Endowment will determine which of its records should be made publicly available, identify additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and post and index such records.

              <SUBJECT>How can I make a FOIA request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General information.</E> To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the Arts Endowment at National Endowment for the Arts, Office of General Counsel, 400 7th St. SW, Second Floor, Washington, DC 20506. Requests may also be sent by facsimile to the General Counsel's office at (202) 682-5572, or by email to <E T="03">foia@arts.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Identity requirements.</E> Depending on the type of document you ask for, the Arts Endowment may require verification of your identity or the identity of a third party.</P>
              <P>(1) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the Arts Endowment's verification requirements as set forth in § 1159.9 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Arts Endowment may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> Requesters must describe the records <PRTPAGE P="346"/>sought in sufficient detail to enable Arts Endowment personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help the Arts Endowment identify the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the Arts Endowment's designated FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. Contact information for the Arts Endowment's designated FOIA contact and FOIA Public Liaison is available on the Arts Endowment's FOIA website (<E T="03">https://www.arts.gov/foia-contacts</E>), or can be obtained by calling (202) 682-54184. If after receiving a request, the Arts Endowment determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Arts Endowment will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the Arts Endowment's designated FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Arts Endowment's response to the request may be delayed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Format specifications.</E> Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records you seek. The Arts Endowment will accommodate your request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Contact information requirements.</E> Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist the Arts Endowment in communicating with them and providing released records.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Arts Endowment ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the Arts Endowment will inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The Arts Endowment Chairperson or his/her designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by the Arts Endowment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultation and referral.</E> When reviewing records located by the Arts Endowment in response to a request, the Arts Endowment will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the Arts Endowment will proceed in one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> When records originated with the Arts Endowment, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, the Arts Endowment will typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Referral.</E> (i) When the Arts Endowment believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Arts Endowment typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Arts Endowment and the originating agency jointly agree that the Arts Endowment is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whenever the Arts Endowment refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</E> The Arts Endowment will <PRTPAGE P="347"/>consider a FOIA request to be a perfected FOIA request if it complies with this section. All consultations and referrals received by the Arts Endowment will be handled in the order of the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</E> The Arts Endowment may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Arts Endowment ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> The Arts Endowment will designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The Arts Endowment may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the Arts Endowment may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The Arts Endowment will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> Whenever the Arts Endowment cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Arts Endowment extends the time limit on that basis, the Arts Endowment will, before expiration of the 20 business day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Arts Endowment estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Arts Endowment will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Arts Endowment will make available its designated FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The Arts Endowment will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Arts Endowment may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The Arts Endowment will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> Consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(i), the Arts Endowment may grant expedited processing under certain circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) The Arts Endowment will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
              <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be submitted to the Arts Endowment's Office of General Counsel. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the Arts Endowment's FOIA Appeals Office per § 1148.8(a).</P>

              <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media <PRTPAGE P="348"/>must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Arts Endowment may waive the formal certification requirement.</P>
              <P>(4) The Arts Endowment will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the Arts Endowment will act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will I receive responses to my requests?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Arts Endowment, to the extent practicable, will communicate with requesters having access to the internet electronically, such as email or web portal.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acknowledgments of requests.</E> The Arts Endowment will acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Arts Endowment will include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.</E> Upon request, the Arts Endowment will provide an estimated date by which the Arts Endowment expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the Arts Endowment may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> Once the Arts Endowment determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The Arts Endowment will also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 1148.10 and will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Arts Endowment will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests.</E> If the Arts Endowment makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of denial.</E> The denial will be signed by the Arts Endowment's General Counsel or designee and will include:</P>
              <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
              <P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the Arts Endowment in denying the request;</P>
              <P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
              <P>(4) A statement that:</P>

              <P>(i) The denial may be appealed under § 1148.8(a);<PRTPAGE P="349"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) That the requester has 90 days to file an appeal in order for it to be considered timely, and that the Arts Endowment will not process or consider appeals that were not filed within 90 days of the receipt of an adverse determination; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the appeal requirements; and</P>
              <P>(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Arts Endowment's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of record exclusions.</E> In the event that the Arts Endowment identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the Arts Endowment will confer with Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion. The Arts Endowment, when invoking an exclusion will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does the Arts Endowment handle confidential commercial information?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by the Arts Endowment from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">When notice to submitters is required.</E> The following rules and procedures determine when the Arts Endowment will provide written notice to submitters of confidential commercial information that their information may be disclosed under FOIA.</P>
              <P>(1) The Arts Endowment will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if the Arts Endowment determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:</P>
              <P>(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The Arts Endowment has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the Arts Endowment may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:</P>
              <P>(1) The Arts Endowment determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;</P>
              <P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or</P>

              <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, the Arts Endowment will give the submitter written notice of <PRTPAGE P="350"/>any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> A submitter will have the opportunity to object to disclosure of information under FOIA.</P>
              <P>(1) The Arts Endowment will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it must provide the Arts Endowment a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.</P>
              <P>(3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The Arts Endowment is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this part may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Analysis of objections.</E> The Arts Endowment must consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> Whenever the Arts Endowment decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Arts Endowment will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the Arts Endowment intends to release them; and</P>
              <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time after the notice.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Arts Endowment will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Requester notification.</E> The Arts Endowment will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How can I appeal a denial of my request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for making an appeal.</E> A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the Arts Endowment's office designated to receive FOIA appeals (“FOIA Appeals Office”). Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 1148.6(e). Requesters can submit appeals by mail by writing to Arts Endowment Chairman, c/o Office of General Counsel, National Endowment for the Arts, 400 7th Street SW, Washington, DC 20506, or online in accordance with instructions on the Arts Endowment's website (<E T="03">https://www.arts.gov/freedom-information-act-guide</E>). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the adverse determination. The appeal should clearly identify the Arts Endowment's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjudication of appeals.</E> (1) The Arts Endowment's Chairperson or his/her designee will act on behalf of the Arts Endowment's Chief FOIA Officer on all appeals under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on appeals.</E> The Arts Endowment will provide its decision on an <PRTPAGE P="351"/>appeal in writing. A decision that upholds the Arts Endowment's determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for its decision, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Arts Endowment's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the Arts Endowment will notify the requester of that determination in writing. The Arts Endowment will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS.</E> Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Arts Endowment agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> Before seeking review by a court of the Arts Endowment's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Timing of appeal.</E> After receiving the Arts Endowment's adverse determination, a requester has 90 calendar days to file an appeal in order for it to be considered timely. The Arts Endowment will not process or consider appeals that were not filed within 90 calendar days of the date of an adverse determination.</P>

              <P>The Arts Endowment will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this part, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. The Arts Endowment will not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will fees be charged?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) The Arts Endowment will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:</P>
              <P>(i) Commercial use requesters;</P>
              <P>(ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and</P>
              <P>(iii) All other requesters.</P>
              <P>(2) Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. The Arts Endowment will consider requests for fee waiver in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the Arts Endowment may contact a requester for additional information. The Arts Endowment will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The Arts Endowment ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States, or by another method as determined by the Arts Endowment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Arts Endowment's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. The Arts Endowment will notify requesters of their placement in this category.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> are those expenses that the Arts Endowment incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct <PRTPAGE P="352"/>costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication</E> is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. The Arts Endowment may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and the Arts Endowment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A request from a professor of architecture at a university for records relating to Arts Endowment grants related to architecture, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A request from the same professor of architecture seeking translation grant information from the Arts Endowment in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. The Arts Endowment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Arts Endowment may also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. The Arts Endowment will advise requesters of their placement in this category.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Review</E> is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review <PRTPAGE P="353"/>time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1148.7, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Search</E> is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Charging fees.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, the Arts Endowment will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, the Arts Endowment will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Searches.</E> The following fee policies apply to searches:</P>
              <P>(i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. The Arts Endowment will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Arts Endowment may properly charge for time spent searching even if the Arts Endowment does not locate any responsive records or if the Arts Endowment determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
              <P>(ii) For manual searches, the fee charged will be the salary rate or rates of the employee or employees conducting the search. For computer searches, the fee charged will be the actual direct cost of providing the service, including the salary rate or rates of the operator(s) or programmer(s) conducting the search. The salary rate is calculated as the particular employee's basic pay plus 16.1 percent. The Arts Endowment may charge fees even if the documents are determined to be exempt from disclosure or cannot be located.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Arts Endowment will charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. The Arts Endowment will notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.</P>
              <P>(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by the Arts Endowment at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Arts Endowment will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> The Arts Endowment will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Arts Endowment will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where the Arts Endowment can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the Arts Endowment will provide one copy per request at the cost of $.10 per single sided page, and $.20 per double sided page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the Arts Endowment will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the Arts Endowment will charge the direct costs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> The Arts Endowment will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the review conducted by the Arts Endowment to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with <PRTPAGE P="354"/>the Arts Endowment's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> The Arts Endowment will adhere to the following restrictions regarding fees it charges:</P>
              <P>(1) When the Arts Endowment determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Arts Endowment fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it will not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Arts Endowment has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the Arts Endowment provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 working days.</P>
              <P>(4) If the Arts Endowment has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Arts Endowment may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken:</P>
              <P>(i) The Arts Endowment provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Arts Endowment discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Arts Endowment may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.</P>
              <P>(5) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
              <P>(6) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
              <P>(7) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the Arts Endowment will provide without charge:</P>
              <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The first two hours of search.</P>
              <P>(8) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> The following procedures apply when the Arts Endowment anticipates fees to be in excess of $25.00.</P>
              <P>(1) When the Arts Endowment determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Arts Endowment will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Arts Endowment will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.</P>

              <P>(2) If the Arts Endowment notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees <PRTPAGE P="355"/>the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Arts Endowment is not required to accept payments in installments.</P>
              <P>(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Arts Endowment estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Arts Endowment will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Arts Endowment will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.</P>
              <P>(4) The Arts Endowment will make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other designated FOIA contact to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> Although not required to provide special services, if the Arts Endowment chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The Arts Endowment may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the Arts Endowment. The Arts Endowment will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> When the Arts Endowment reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Arts Endowment may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Arts Endowment may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30 calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Arts Endowment will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> The following policies and procedures apply to advanced payments of fees:</P>

              <P>(1) For requests other than those described in paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section, the Arts Endowment will not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.</P>
              <P>(2) When the Arts Endowment determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Arts Endowment may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.</P>

              <P>(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the Arts Endowment may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the Arts Endowment may <PRTPAGE P="356"/>require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the Arts Endowment begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where the Arts Endowment has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.</P>
              <P>(4) In cases in which the Arts Endowment requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the Arts Endowment's fee determination, the request will be closed.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires the Arts Endowment to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the Arts Endowment will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</E> The following policies and procedures apply to fee waivers or reductions of fees.</P>
              <P>(1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>(2) The Arts Endowment will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
              <P>(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
              <P>(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. The Arts Endowment will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</P>
              <P>(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Arts Endowment will consider the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(A) The Arts Endowment will identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>

              <P>(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Arts Endowment will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Arts Endowment ordinarily will presume that when a news <PRTPAGE P="357"/>media requester has satisfied the factors in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
              <P>(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.</P>
              <P>(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Arts Endowment and should address the criteria referenced in paragraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</P>

                <P>(a) Yes. The Inspector General has authority to issue administrative subpoenas for the production of records <PRTPAGE P="361"/>and documents. If an investigating official concludes that a subpoena is warranted, he/she may issue a subpoena.</P>

                <P>(c) Nothing in this section modifies any responsibility of an investigating official to report violations of criminal law to the appropriate component of the Department of Justice.</P>

                <P>(a) If the investigating official concludes that an action under this part is warranted, the investigating official submits a report containing the findings and conclusions of the investigation to the reviewing official.</P>
                <P>(b) If the reviewing official determines that the report provides adequate evidence that you have made a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim or statement, the reviewing official shall transmit to the Attorney General written notice of an intention to refer the matter for adjudication, with a request for approval of such referral. This notice will include the reviewing official's statements concerning:</P>
                <P>(1) The reasons for the referral;</P>
                <P>(2) The claims or statements upon which liability would be based;</P>
                <P>(3) The evidence that supports liability;</P>
                <P>(4) An estimate of the amount of money or the value of property, services, or other benefits requested or demanded in the false claim or statement;</P>
                <P>(5) Any exculpatory or mitigating circumstances that may relate to the claims or statements known by the reviewing official or the investigating official; and</P>
                <P>(6) A statement that there is a reasonable prospect of collecting an appropriate amount of penalties and assessments.</P>
                <P>(c) If, at any time, the Attorney General or his or her designee requests in writing that this administrative process be stayed, the authority head must stay the process immediately. The authority head may order the process resumed only upon receipt of the written authorization of the Attorney General.</P>

                <P>(a) When the Chairperson determines that you owe a debt to the Endowment, he or she will send you a written notice (Notice). The Notice will be hand-delivered or sent to you by certified mail, return receipt requested at the most current address known to the Endowment. The Notice will inform you of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The amount, nature, and basis of the debt;</P>
                <P>(2) That a designated Endowment official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid;</P>
                <P>(3) That payment of the debt is due as of the date of the Notice, and that the debt will be considered delinquent if you do not pay it within 30 days of the date of the Notice;</P>

                <P>(4) The Endowment's policy concerning interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs (see § 1150.7), including a statement that such assessments must be made against you unless excused in accordance with the <PRTPAGE P="377"/>Federal Claims Collection Standards and this part;</P>
                <P>(5) That you have the right to inspect and copy Endowment records pertaining to your debt, or to receive copies of those records if personal inspection is impractical;</P>
                <P>(6) That you have the opportunity to enter into an agreement, in writing and signed by both you and the Chairperson, for voluntary repayment of the debt (see § 1150.9); and</P>
                <P>(7) The address, telephone number, and name of the Endowment official available to discuss the debt.</P>
                <P>(b) Notice of possible collection actions. The Notice provided by the Chairperson under paragraph (a) of this section will also advise you that, if your debt (including any interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is not paid within 60 days of the date of the Notice, or you do not enter into a voluntary repayment agreement within 60 days of the date of the Notice, then the Endowment may enforce collection of the debt by any or all of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(1) By referral to a credit reporting agency (see § 1150.12), a collection agency (see § 1150.13), or the DOJ (see § 1150.14);</P>
                <P>(2) By transferring any debt delinquent for more than 180 days to the Treasury for collection under a cross-servicing agreement with the Treasury (see § 1150.15);</P>
                <P>(3) If you are an Endowment employee, by deducting money from your disposable pay account (in the amount and with the frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration specified by the Endowment) until the debt (and all accumulated interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is paid in full (see subpart B). Such proceedings are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514;</P>
                <P>(4) If you are an employee of a Federal agency other than the Endowment, by initiating certification procedures to implement a salary offset by that Federal agency (see subpart B). Such proceedings are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514;</P>
                <P>(5) By referring the debt to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax (see subpart C);</P>
                <P>(6) By administrative offset (see subpart D); or</P>
                <P>(7) By liquidation of security or collateral. When the Endowment holds security or collateral that may be liquidated and the proceeds applied to your debt through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial foreclosure, such procedures may be followed unless the cost of disposing of the collateral will be disproportionate to its value or special circumstances require judicial foreclosure.</P>
                <P>(c) Notice of opportunity for review. The Notice provided by the Chairperson under paragraph (a) of this section will also advise you of the opportunity to obtain a review within the Endowment concerning the existence or amount of the debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable. The Notice shall also advise you of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The name, address, and telephone number of an officer or employee of the Endowment whom you may contact concerning procedures for requesting a review;</P>
                <P>(2) The method and time period for requesting a review;</P>
                <P>(3) That the filing of a request for a review on or before the 60th day following the date of the Notice will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;</P>
                <P>(4) The name and address of the officer or employee of the Endowment to whom you should send the request for a review;</P>
                <P>(5) That a final decision on the review (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the receipt of the request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings;</P>
                <P>(6) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject you to:</P>
                <P>(i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statute or regulations;</P>

                <P>(ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733) or any other applicable statutory authority; and<PRTPAGE P="378"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or any other applicable statutory authority;</P>
                <P>(7) Any other rights available to you to dispute the validity of the debt or to have recovery of the debt waived, or remedies available to you under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and</P>
                <P>(8) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt that are later waived or found not owed will be promptly refunded to you.</P>
                <P>(d) The Endowment will respond promptly to communications from you.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What opportunity do I have to obtain a review of my debt within the Endowment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> If you desire a review within the Endowment concerning the existence or amount of your debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable, you must send such a request to the officer or employee of the Endowment designated in the Notice (see § 1150.5(c)(4)).</P>
                <P>(1) Your request for review must carry your signature and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts and evidence that support your position. Your request for review should be accompanied by available evidence to support your contentions.</P>
                <P>(2) Your request for review must be received by the designated officer or employee of the Endowment on or before the 60th day following the date of the Notice. Timely filing will stay the commencement of collection procedures. If you file a request for a review after the 60-day period provided for in this section, the Endowment will accept the request if you can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond your control or because you did not receive notice of the filing deadline (unless you had actual notice of the filing deadline).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection of Endowment records related to the debt.</E> (1) In accordance with § 1150.5, if you want to inspect or copy Endowment records related to the debt, you must send a letter to the Endowment official designated in the Notice stating your intention. Your letter must be received within 30 days of the date of the Notice.</P>
                <P>(2) In response to the timely request described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the designated Endowment official will notify you of the location and time when you may inspect and copy records related to the debt.</P>
                <P>(3) If personal inspection of Endowment records related to the debt is impractical, reasonable arrangements will be made to send you copies of those records.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Review official.</E> The Chairperson shall designate an officer or employee of the Endowment (who was not involved in the determination of the debt) as the review official. When required by law or regulation, the Endowment may request an administrative law judge to conduct the review, or may obtain a review official who is an official, employee, or agent of the United States, but who is not under the supervision or control of the Chairperson. However, unless the review is conducted by an official or employee of the Endowment, any unresolved dispute you have regarding whether all or part of the debt is past due or legally enforceable (for purposes of collection by tax refund offset under § 1150.31) must be referred to the Chairperson for ultimate administrative disposition, and the Chairperson must notify you of his or her determination.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Review procedure.</E> After you request a review, the review official will notify you of the form of the review to be provided. The review official shall determine whether an oral hearing is required, or if a review of the written record is sufficient, in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards. In either case, the review official shall conduct the review in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards. If the review will include an oral hearing, the notice sent to you by the review official will set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Date of decision.</E> The review official will issue a written decision, based upon either the written record or documentary evidence and information developed at an oral hearing, as soon as practical, but not later than 60 days <PRTPAGE P="379"/>after the date on which the Endowment received your request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of review decision.</E> The review official will prepare a written decision that includes:</P>
                <P>(1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
                <P>(2) The review official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</P>
                <P>(3) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Interest, penalty charge, and administrative cost accrual during review period.</E> Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs authorized by law will continue to accrue during the review period.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Interest.</E> (1) The Endowment will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.</P>
                <P>(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. The Endowment will not recover interest if you pay the debt within 30 days of the date on which interest begins to accrue. The Endowment shall assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is either necessary to protect the interests of the Endowment or established by a contract, repayment agreement, or statute. The Endowment will notify you of the basis for its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the interests of the Endowment.</P>
                <P>(3) The Chairperson may extend the 30-day period for payment without interest where he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the Endowment. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final and is not subject to further review.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalty.</E> The Endowment will assess a penalty charge, not to exceed 6 percent a year, on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> The Endowment will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Endowment.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Allocation of payments.</E> A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional authority.</E> The Endowment may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> (1) The Chairperson may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs, if he or she determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the Endowment.</P>
                <P>(2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, where these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Chairperson's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges is final and is not subject to further review.</P>

                <P>In response to a Notice of debt, you may propose to the Endowment that you be allowed to repay the debt through a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of the Endowment taking other collection actions under this part.</P>
                <P>(a) Your request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement must:</P>
                <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
                <P>(2) Admit the existence of the debt; and</P>
                <P>(3) Either propose payment of the debt (together with interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) in a lump sum, or set forth a proposed repayment schedule.</P>
                <P>(b) The Endowment will collect claims in full or one lump sum whenever feasible. However, if you are unable to pay your debt in one lump sum, the Endowment may accept payment in regular installments that bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and your ability to pay.</P>
                <P>(c) The Endowment will consider a request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards. The Chairperson may request additional information from you, including financial statements if you request to make payments in installments, in order to make a determination of whether to accept a voluntary repayment agreement. It is within the Chairperson's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding with other collection actions under this part, and to set the necessary terms of any voluntary repayment agreement. No repayment agreement will be binding on the Endowment unless it is in writing and signed by both you and the Chairperson. At the Endowment's option, you may be required to enter into a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety as part of an agreement to make payments in installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by 31 U.S.C. 3711.</P>

Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended. Joining two or more claims in a demand upon a debtor for payment of more than $100,000 does not preclude compromise or suspension or termination of collection action with regard to any one claim not exceeding $100,000, excluding interest.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What debts are included or excluded from coverage of these regulations on salary offset?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The regulations in this subpart provide Endowment procedures for the collection by salary offset of a Federal employee's pay to satisfy certain debts owed to the Endowment or to other Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(b) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.</P>
                <P>(c) Nothing in the regulations in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, or the Federal Claims Collection Standards.</P>
                <P>(d) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code takes precedence over a salary offset under this subpart, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d).</P>
                <P>(e) This subpart does not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of your election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four or fewer pay periods.</P>

                <P>Yes. The regulations in this subpart do not preclude you from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory provisions pertaining to the particular debts being collected.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the Endowment's procedures for salary offset?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Endowment will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) If you are an Endowment employee, the Endowment's payroll office will determine the amount of your disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.</P>
                <P>(c) Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt by the Endowment's payroll office of certification of debt from the creditor agency.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Types of collection</E>—(1) <E T="03">Lump-sum offset.</E> If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump-sum offset.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and your ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless you have agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Deductions from final check.</E> A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is <PRTPAGE P="383"/>being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Deductions from other sources.</E> If an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Endowment, and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, then the Endowment may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards.</P>
                <P>(e) Multiple debts. In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Endowment's payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How will the Endowment coordinate salary offsets with other agencies?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Responsibilities of the Endowment as the creditor agency.</E> Upon completion of the procedures established in this subpart and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Endowment must submit a claim to a paying agency.</P>
                <P>(1) In its claim, the Endowment must certify, in writing, the following:</P>
                <P>(i) That the employee owes the debt;</P>
                <P>(ii) The amount and basis of the debt;</P>
                <P>(iii) The date the Endowment's right to collect the debt first accrued; and</P>
                <P>(iv) That the Endowment's regulations in this subpart have been approved by OPM under 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.</P>
                <P>(2) If the collection must be made in installments, the Endowment's claim will also advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment. The Endowment may also advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected and the date of the first installment, if that date is other than the next officially established pay period.</P>
                <P>(3) The Endowment shall also include in its claim:</P>
                <P>(i) The employee's written consent to the salary offset;</P>
                <P>(ii) The employee's signed statement acknowledging receipt of the procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Information regarding the completion of procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514, including the actions taken and the dates of those actions.</P>
                <P>(4) If the employee is in the process of separating and has not received a final salary check or other final payment(s) from the paying agency, the Endowment must submit its claim to the paying agency for collection under 31 U.S.C. 3716. The paying agency will (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and notify the employee and the Endowment. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal government sources, then (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), the paying agency will provide written notice of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making the other payments to the debtor employee. The written notice will state that the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the Endowment must submit a properly certified claim under this paragraph (a)(4) to the agency responsible for making the payments before the collection can be made.</P>
                <P>(5) Separated employee. If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Endowment may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be administratively offset to collect the debt.</P>

                <P>(6) Employee transfer. When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, the Endowment will not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. The Endowment will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently <PRTPAGE P="384"/>review the debt to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibilities of the Endowment as the paying agency.</E> (1) Complete claim. When the Endowment receives a certified claim from a creditor agency (under the creditor agency's regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), deductions should be scheduled to begin within three officially established pay intervals. Before deductions can begin, the employee will receive a written notice from the Endowment including:</P>
                <P>(i) A statement that the Endowment has received a certified claim from the creditor agency;</P>
                <P>(ii) The amount of the claim;</P>
                <P>(iii) The date salary offset deductions will begin; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The amount of such deductions.</P>
                <P>(2) Incomplete claim. When the Endowment receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Endowment will return the claim with a notice that the creditor agency must comply with the procedures required under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and must properly certify a claim to the Endowment before the Endowment will take action to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>
                <P>(3) The Endowment is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>
                <P>(4) Employees who transfer from the Endowment to another paying agency. If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim to the Endowment, the employee transfers from the Endowment to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the Endowment will certify the total amount collected on the debt and notify the employee and the creditor agency in writing. The notification to the creditor agency will include information on the employee's transfer.</P>

                <P>(1) The debt is waived or all or part of the funds deducted are otherwise found not to be owed (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or</P>

                <P>(a) The regulations in this subpart apply to the collection of any debts you owe to the Endowment, or to any request from another Federal agency that the Endowment collect a debt you owe by offsetting your debt against a payment the Endowment owes you. Administrative offset is authorized under Section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3716).

                <SUBJECT>What procedures will the Endowment use to collect amounts I owe to a Federal agency by offsetting a payment that the Endowment would otherwise make to me?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Any Federal agency may request that the Endowment administratively offset funds due and payable to you in order to collect a debt you owe to that agency. The Endowment will initiate the requested offset only upon:</P>
                <P>(1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency stating:</P>
                <P>(i) That you owe the debt;</P>
                <P>(ii) The amount and basis of the debt;</P>
                <P>(iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and</P>
                <P>(iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, including providing you with any required hearing or review; and</P>
                <P>(2) A determination by the Chairperson that offsetting funds payable to you by the Endowment in order to collect a debt owed by you would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such an offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Multiple debts.</E> In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking administrative offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Endowment may, in its discretion, allocate the amount it owes to you to the creditor agencies in accordance with the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.</P>

                <SUBJECT>When may the Endowment make an offset in an expedited manner?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Endowment may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to you before completion of the procedures required by §§ 1150.41 and 1150.42 if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize the Endowment's ability to collect the debt and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. An expedited offset will be followed promptly by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset, but later found not to be owed to the Endowment, will be promptly refunded.</P>

For example, a music school receiving Endowment financial assistance could <PRTPAGE P="389"/>not deny admission to a qualified blind applicant because a blind singer may experience more difficulty than a nonhandicapped singer in finding a job.</P>

                  <P>(4) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;</P>
                  <P>(5) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;</P>
                  <P>(6) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or</P>
                  <P>(7) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.</P>
                  <P>(b) Despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or services provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in such aid, benefits, or services that are not separate or different.</P>
                  <P>(c) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration:</P>
                  <P>(1) That have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap;</P>
                  <P>(2) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped persons; or</P>

                  <P>(d) A recipient may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections:</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Illustrative examples.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the activities funded by the National Endowment for the Arts.</P>
                  <P>(1) A museum exhibition catalogue or small press editions supported by the Endowment may be made usable by the blind and the visually impaired through cassette tapes, records, discs, braille, readers and simultaneous publications;</P>
                  <P>(2) A theatre performance supported by Federal funds may be made available to deaf and hearing impaired persons through the use of a sign language interpreter or by providing scripts in advance of the performance.</P>
                  <P>(3) A performing arts organization receiving Federal funds and offering, for example, a specific event in an inaccessible facility may arrange to provide a reasonable opportunity for that specific event to be offered to the public at large in an alternative accessible space; e.g., a theatre offering four different plays a season may offer at least one performance of each play in an alternative accessible space.</P>
                  <P>(4) Recipients of federal funds should make every effort to assure that they do not support organizations or individuals that discriminate;</P>
                  <P>(5) A handicapped person with experience and expertise equal to qualification standards established by a planning or advisory board may not be excluded from participation on the board on the basis of handicap. This does not mean that every planning or advisory board necessarily must include a handicapped person.</P>
                  <P>(b) Despite the existence of permissible separate or different aid, benefits, or services, e.g., periodic performances in alternative accessible spaces, a physically handicapped person who wishes to be, and can be, escorted to a seat, may not be denied such access to an otherwise inaccessible theatre.</P>
                  <P>(c) State arts agencies are obligated to develop methods of administering federal funds so as to ensure that handicapped persons are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of handicap either by sub-grantees or by the manner in which the funds are distributed.</P>
                  <P>(d) In the event Endowment funds are utilized to construct, expand, alter, lease or rent a facility, the aid, benefits, or services provided in or through that facility must be conducted in accordance with these regulations, e.g., a museum receiving a grant to renovate an existing facility must assure that all museum aid, benefits, or services conducted in that facility are accessible to handicapped persons.</P>
                  <P>(e) In carrying out the mandate of section 504 and these implementing regulations recipients should make every effort to administer Endowment assisted programs or activities in a setting in which able-bodied and disabled persons are integrated, e.g., tours made available to the hearing impaired should be open to the public at large and everyone should be permitted to enjoy the benefits of a tactile experience in a museum.</P>

A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>

The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. Upon request, the recipient shall make available for public inspection a copy of the transition plan. The plan shall, at a minimum:</P>
                  <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped persons;</P>
                  <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
                  <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under paragraph (a) of this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
                  <P>(4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
              <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
              <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1153.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, <PRTPAGE P="403"/>or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1153.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1153.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
              <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
              <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
              <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

              <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

              <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.<PRTPAGE P="404"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
              <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
              <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
              <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1153.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

                <P>The purpose of this part is to implement the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (“Act”), as amended, and as required by the general age discrimination regulations at 45 CFR part 90.

                <P>The Endowment may conduct compliance reviews, pre-award reviews and other similar procedures in order to investigate and correct violations of the Act and regulations. The Endowment may conduct these reviews in the absence of a compliant against the recipient. In the event a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation of the regulations in this part, the Endowment will attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, enforcement efforts will proceed as described in § 1156.19.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Complaints.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with the Endowment, alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act and the regulations in this part based on an action occurring on or after July 1, 1979. A complainant shall file a complaint within <PRTPAGE P="409"/>180 days from the date that the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause, the Endowment may extend this time limit. The Endowment will consider the date a complaint is filed to be the date upon which the complaint is sufficient to be processed.</P>
                <P>(b) Complaints must include a written statement identifying the parties involved, describing the alleged violation, and stating the date on which the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation. Complaints must be signed by the complainant. The Endowment will return any complaint that does not contain the necessary information, that is not signed by the complainant, or that is not within the Endowment's jurisdiction for any other reason. The Endowment will provide an explanation for all such returned complaints.</P>
                <P>(c) The Endowment will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following measures:</P>
                <P>(1) Widely disseminating information regarding the obligations of recipients under the Act and the regulations in this part.</P>
                <P>(2) Notifying the complainant and the recipient of their rights and obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to have a representative at all stages of the complaint procedure.</P>
                <P>(3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representatives) of their right to contact the Endowment for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Referral of complaints for mediation.</E> The Endowment will promptly refer all complaints to the agency designated by the Secretary of HHS to manage the mediation process that:</P>
                <P>(1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the regulations in this part; and</P>
                <P>(2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.</P>
                <P>(b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informal judgment that an agreement is not possible. There must be at least one meeting with the mediator before the Endowment will accept a judgment that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.</P>
                <P>(c) If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, they shall reduce the agreement to wiring. The mediator shall send a copy of the settlement to the Endowment. No further action shall be taken by the Endowment based on that complaint unless it appears that the complainant or the recipient has failed to comply with the agreement.</P>
                <P>(d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.</P>
                <P>(e) Not more than 60 days after the Endowment receives the complaint, the mediator shall return a still unresolved complaint to the Endowment for initial investigation. The mediator may return a complaint at any time before the end of the 60-day period if it appears that the complaint cannot be resolved through mediation. The mediator may extend this 60-day period, provided the Endowment concurs, for not more than 30 days, if the mediator determines that resolution is likely to occur within such period.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Informal investigation.</E> (1) The Endowment will investigate complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement.</P>

                <P>(2) As part of the initial investigation, the Endowment will use informal fact-finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and the recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, resolve the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. The Endowment may seek <PRTPAGE P="410"/>the assistance of any involved State agency.</P>
                <P>(3) The Endowment will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official at the Endowment.</P>
                <P>(4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of the Endowment, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.</P>
                <P>(5) The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Formal investigation, conciliation, and hearing.</E> If the Endowment cannot resolve the complaint during the early stages of the investigation, it shall:</P>
                <P>(1) Complete the investigation of the complaint.</P>
                <P>(2) Attempt to achieve voluntary compliance satisfactory to the Endowment, if the investigation indicates a violation.</P>
                <P>(3) Arrange for enforcement as described in § 1156.19, if necessary.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Compliance procedure.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Endowment may enforce the Act and the regulations in this part through:</P>
                <P>(1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from the Endowment under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act and the regulations in this part. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. Therefore, a case which is settled in mediation, or prior to a hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from the Endowment unless it is reopened because of a violation of the agreement.</P>
                <P>(2) Any other means authorized by law including, but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or the regulations in this part.</P>
                <P>(ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or the regulations in this part.</P>
                <P>(b) The Endowment will limit any termination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or portion thereof that the Endowment finds in violation of the regulations in this part. The Endowment will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from the Endowment.</P>
                <P>(c) The Endowment will not take action under paragraph (a) of this section until:</P>
                <P>(1) The Chairperson has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and the regulations in this part and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.</P>
                <P>(2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Chairperson has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Chairperson will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) The Chairperson also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from the Endowment to a recipient when a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is initiated.</P>

                <P>(1) New Federal financial assistance from the Endowment includes all assistance for which the Endowment requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from the Endowment does not include assistance approved prior to the beginning of a termination hearing under <PRTPAGE P="411"/>paragraph (a)(1) of this section or increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards.</P>
                <P>(2) The Endowment will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Endowment will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Chairperson. The Endowment will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient. If the hearing results in a finding against the recipient, the Endowment must terminate funds.</P>

                <P>(a) When the endowment withholds funds from a recipient under the regulations in this part, the Chairperson may disburse the withheld funds directly to an alternate recipient otherwise eligible for Endowment support: any public or nonprofit private organization or agency, or State or political subdivision of the State.</P>
                <P>(b) The Chairperson will require any alternate recipient to demonstrate:</P>

                <P>(2) The Endowment issues a finding in favor of the recipient.</P>
                <P>(b) If the Endowment fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a finding in favor of the recipient, the Endowment will:</P>
                <P>(1) Promptly advise the complainant if either of the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section has been met;</P>
                <P>(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil action for injunctive relief that will effect the purpose of the Act;</P>
                <P>(3) Inform the complainant:</P>
                <P>(i) That the complainant may bring a civil action only in the United States district court for the district in which the recipient is located or transacts business;</P>
                <P>(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;</P>
                <P>(iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 days notice by registered mail to the Chairperson of the Endowment, the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;</P>
                <P>(iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and whether or not the attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and</P>
                <P>(v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.</P>

                <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1158.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>

                <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
                <P>(e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $20,134, absent aggravating circumstances.

              <SUBJECT>How can I acquire access to Endowment records pertaining to me?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following procedures apply to records that are contained in an Endowment system:</P>
              <P>(a) You may request review of records pertaining to you by writing to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1159.3 of this part). You may also call the Office of the General Counsel at (202) 682-5418 on business days, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., to schedule an appointment to make such a request in person. In either case, your request should be presented in writing and should specifically identify the Endowment systems involved.</P>
              <P>(b) Access to the record, or to any other information pertaining to you that is contained in the system, shall be provided if the identification requirements of § 1159.9 of this part are satisfied and the record is otherwise determined to be releasable under the Privacy Act and these regulations. The Endowment shall provide you an opportunity to have a copy made of any such record about you. Only one copy of each requested record will be supplied, based on the fee schedule in § 1159.12 of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) The Endowment will comply promptly with requests made in person at scheduled appointments, if the requirements of this section are met and the records sought are immediately available. The Endowment will acknowledge mailed requests, or personal requests for documents that are not immediately available, within 10 business days, and the information requested will be provided promptly thereafter.</P>

              <P>(d) If you make your request in person at a scheduled appointment, you may, upon your request, be accompanied by a person of your choice to review your record. The Endowment may require that you furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of your record in the accompanying person's presence. A record may be disclosed to a representative chosen by you upon your proper written consent.<PRTPAGE P="426"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Medical or psychological records pertaining to you shall be disclosed to you unless, in the judgment of the Endowment, access to such records might have an adverse effect upon you. When such determination has been made, the Endowment may refuse to disclose such information directly to you. The Endowment will, however, disclose this information to a licensed physician designated by you in writing.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What identification will I need to show when I request access to Endowment records pertaining to me?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Endowment shall require reasonable identification of all individuals who request access to records in an Endowment system to ensure that they are disclosed to the proper person.</P>
              <P>(a) The amount of personal identification required will of necessity vary with the sensitivity of the record involved. In general, if you request disclosure in person, you shall be required to show an identification card, such as a driver's license, containing your photograph and sample signature. However, with regard to records in Endowment systems that contain particularly sensitive and/or detailed personal information, the Endowment reserves the right to require additional means of identification as are appropriate under the circumstances. These means include, but are not limited to, requiring you to sign a statement under oath as to your identity, acknowledging that you are aware of the penalties for improper disclosure under the provisions of the Privacy Act.</P>
              <P>(b) If you request disclosure by mail, the Endowment will request such information as may be necessary to ensure that you are properly identified. Authorized means to achieve this goal include, but are not limited to, requiring that a mail request include certification that a duly commissioned notary public of any State or territory (or a similar official, if the request is made outside of the United States) received an acknowledgment of identity from you.</P>
              <P>(c) If you are unable to provide suitable documentation or identification, the Endowment may require a signed, notarized statement asserting your identity and stipulating that you understand that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How can I pursue amendments to or corrections of an Endowment record?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You are entitled to request amendments to or corrections of records pertaining to you pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Such a request should be made in writing and addressed to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1159.3 of this part).</P>
              <P>(b) Your request for amendments or corrections should specify the following:</P>

              <P>(2) The Endowment system from which the record was retrieved;</P>

              <P>(4) Your reasons for requesting amendment or correction of the record.</P>
              <P>(c) The Endowment will acknowledge a request for amendment or correction of a record within 10 business days of its receipt, unless the request can be processed and the individual informed of the General Counsel's decision on the request within that 10-day period.</P>
              <P>(d) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel agrees that the record is not accurate, timely, or complete, based on a preponderance of the evidence, then the record will be corrected or amended promptly. The record will be deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is not relevant or necessary to accomplish the Endowment function for which the record was provided or is maintained. In either case, you will be informed in writing of the amendment, correction, or deletion. In addition, if accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>

              <P>(e) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel does not agree that the record <PRTPAGE P="427"/>should be amended or corrected, you will be informed promptly in writing of the refusal to amend or correct the record and the reason for this decision. You will also be informed that you may appeal this refusal in accordance with § 1159.11 of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) Requests to amend or correct a record governed by the regulations of another agency will be forwarded to such agency for processing, and you will be informed in writing of this referral.</P>

Such appeal must be made in writing within 10 business days of your receipt of the initial refusal to amend or correct your record. Your appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1159.3 of this part), should indicate that it is an appeal, and should include the basis for the appeal.</P>
              <P>(b) The Chairperson will review your request to amend or correct the record, the General Counsel's refusal, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal. No hearing will be held.</P>
              <P>(c) The Chairperson shall render his or her decision on your appeal within 30 business days of its receipt by the Endowment, unless the Chairperson, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period. Should the Chairperson extend the appeal period, you will be informed in writing of the extension and the circumstances of the delay.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Chairperson determines that the record that is the subject of the appeal should be amended or corrected, the record will be so modified, and you will be informed in writing of the amendment or correction. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>
              <P>(e) If your appeal is denied, you will be informed in writing of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The denial and the reasons for the denial;</P>
              <P>(2) That you may submit to the Endowment a concise statement setting forth the reasons for your disagreement as to the disputed record. Under the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, your statement will be disclosed whenever the disputed record is disclosed; and</P>
              <P>(3) That you may seek judicial review of the Chairperson's determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(a).</P>
              <P>(f) Whenever you submit a statement of disagreement to the Endowment in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the record will be annotated to indicate that it is disputed. In any subsequent disclosure, a copy of your statement of disagreement will be disclosed with the record. If the Endowment deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the Chairperson's reasons for denying your appeal may also be disclosed with the record. While you will have access to this statement of the Chairperson's reasons for denying your appeal, such statement will not be subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be provided a copy of your statement of disagreement, as well as any statement of the Chairperson's reasons for denying your appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Will the Endowment charge me fees to locate, review, or copy records?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Endowment shall charge no fees for search time or for any other time expended by the Endowment to review a record. However, the Endowment may charge fees where you request that a copy be made of a record to which you have been granted access. Where a copy of the record must be made in order to provide access to the record (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> computer printout where no screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to you without cost.</P>

              <P>(b) Copies of records made by photocopy or similar process will be charged to you at the rate of $0.10 per page. Where records are not susceptible to photocopying (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> punch cards, magnetic tapes, or oversize materials), you will be charged actual cost as determined on a case-by-case basis. A copying fee totaling $3.00 or less shall be <PRTPAGE P="428"/>waived, but the copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee.</P>
              <P>(c) Special and additional services provided at your request, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance, and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to you.</P>
              <P>(d) A copying fee shall not be charged or, alternatively, it may be reduced, when the General Counsel determines, based on a petition, that the petitioning individual is indigent and that the Endowment's resources permit a waiver of all or part of the fee.</P>
              <P>(e) All fees shall be paid before any copying request is undertaken. Payments shall be made by check or money order payable to the “National Endowment for the Arts.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>In what other situations will the Endowment disclose its records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Endowment shall not disclose any record that is contained in a system of records to any person or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by or with the prior written consent of the subject individual, unless disclosure of the record is:</P>
              <P>(1) To those officers or employees of the Endowment who maintain the record and who have a need for the record in the performance of their official duties;</P>
              <P>(2) Required under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Records required to be made available by the Freedom of Information Act will be released in response to a request to the Endowment formulated in accordance with the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities regulations published at 45 CFR part 1100;</P>

              <P>(3) For a routine use as published in the annual notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>

              <P>(5) To a recipient who has provided the Endowment with adequate advance written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;</P>
              <P>(6) To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record that has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States government, or for evaluation by the Archivist of the United States, or his or her designee, to determine whether the record has such value;</P>
              <P>(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity, if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Endowment for such records specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought. The Endowment may also disclose such a record to a law enforcement agency on its own initiative in situations in which criminal conduct is suspected, provided that such disclosure has been established as a routine use, or in situations in which the misconduct is directly related to the purpose for which the record is maintained;</P>
              <P>(8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if, upon such disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;</P>
              <P>(9) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress, or subcommittee of any such joint committee;</P>

              <P>(b) Before disseminating any record about any individual to any person other than an Endowment employee, the Endowment shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that such records are, or at the time they were collected were, accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for Endowment purposes. This paragraph (b) does not apply to disseminations made pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>The Deputy Chairman for Management and Budget has the responsibility of maintaining adequate technical, physical, and security safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or destruction of manual and automatic record systems. These security safeguards shall apply to all systems in which identifiable personal data are processed or maintained, including all reports and outputs from such systems that contain identifiable personal information. Such safeguards must be sufficient to prevent negligent, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification or destruction of any personal records or data, and must furthermore minimize, to the extent practicable, the risk that skilled technicians or knowledgeable persons could improperly obtain access to modify or destroy such records or data and shall further insure against such casual entry by unskilled persons without official reasons for access to such records or data.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Manual systems.</E> (1) Records contained in a system of records as defined herein may be used, held or stored only where facilities are adequate to prevent unauthorized access by persons within or outside the Endowment.</P>
              <P>(2) All records, when not under the personal control of the employees authorized to use the records, must be stored in a locked metal filing cabinet. Some systems of records are not of such confidential nature that their disclosure would constitute a harm to an individual who is the subject of such record. However, records in this category shall also be maintained in locked metal filing cabinets or maintained in a secured room with a locking door.</P>
              <P>(3) Access to and use of a system of records shall be permitted only to persons whose duties require such access within the Endowment, for routine uses as defined in § 1159.1 as to any given system, or for such other uses as may be provided herein.</P>
              <P>(4) Other than for access within the Endowment to persons needing such records in the performance of their official duties or routine uses as defined in § 1159.1, or such other uses as provided herein, access to records within a system of records shall be permitted only to the individual to whom the record pertains or upon his or her written request to the General Counsel.</P>

              <P>(5) Access to areas where a system of records is stored will be limited to <PRTPAGE P="430"/>those persons whose duties require work in such areas. There shall be an accounting of the removal of any records from such storage areas utilizing a written log, as directed by the Deputy Chairman for Management and Budget. The written log shall be maintained at all times.</P>
              <P>(6) The Endowment shall ensure that all persons whose duties require access to and use of records contained in a system of records are adequately trained to protect the security and privacy of such records.</P>
              <P>(7) The disposal and destruction of records within a system of records shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the General Services Administration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Automated systems.</E> (1) Identifiable personal information may be processed, stored or maintained by automated data systems only where facilities or conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access to such systems in any form. Whenever such data, whether contained in punch cards, magnetic tapes or discs, are not under the personal control of an authorized person, such information must be stored in a locked or secured room, or in such other facility having greater safeguards than those provided for herein.</P>
              <P>(2) Access to and use of identifiable personal data associated with automated data systems shall be limited to those persons whose duties require such access. Proper control of personal data in any form associated with automated data systems shall be maintained at all times, including maintenance of accountability records showing disposition of input and output documents.</P>
              <P>(3) All persons whose duties require access to processing and maintenance of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be adequately trained in the security and privacy of personal data.</P>
              <P>(4) The disposal and disposition of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be done by shredding, burning or in the case of tapes or discs, degaussing, in accordance with any regulations now or hereafter proposed by the General Services Administration or other appropriate authority.</P>

The Chairperson shall also ensure that all Endowment employees having access to records receive adequate training in their protection, and that records have adequate and proper storage with sufficient security to assure the privacy of such records.</P>

              <P>(b) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Endowment system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), insofar as that Endowment system consists of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of the exemption at 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</P>

              <P>(c) The Endowment system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” is exempt from the above-noted provisions of the Privacy Act because their application might <PRTPAGE P="431"/>alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations; lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence; disclose investigative techniques or procedures; reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses; or otherwise impair investigations.</P>

The organizer is planning to include 25 masterpieces by Renoir from American public and private collections. The show will open in Chicago and travel to San Francisco and Washington.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Discussion.</E> This example is a common application for coverage of both foreign- and domestic-owned objects in an international exhibition. The foreign-owned objects are eligible for indemnity coverage under paragraph (a) of this section, and the domestic-owned objects may be eligible for indemnity coverage under paragraph (c) of this section if the foreign-owned objects are integral to the purposes of the exhibition as a whole. In reviewing this application, the Federal Council would evaluate the exhibition as a whole and determine whether the loans of 125 foreign-owned objects are integral to the educational, cultural, historical, or scientific significance of the exhibition on Renoir. It would also be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility for domestic exhibitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>An indemnity agreement for a domestic exhibition made under these regulations shall cover eligible items from the United States while on Exhibition in the United States.</P>
              <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> An American museum is undergoing renovation and will be closed to the public for one year. During that time, masterpieces from the collection will go on tour to three other museums in the United States. Many of these works have never been lent for travel, and this will be a unique and the last opportunity for museum visitors in other parts of the country to see them exhibited together. Once the new building opens, they will be permanently installed and dispersed throughout the museum's galleries.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Discussion.</E> (i) This is a straightforward example of a domestic exhibition which would be eligible for consideration for indemnity coverage. Under the previous regulations, eligibility was limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) Exhibitions in the United States of entirely foreign-owned objects;</P>
              <P>(B) Exhibitions outside of the United States of domestic-owned objects; or</P>

              <P>(C) Exhibitions in the United States of both foreign- and domestic-owned objects, with the foreign-owned objects <PRTPAGE P="434"/>having integral importance to the exhibition.</P>
              <P>(ii) In this example, the Federal Council will consider the educational, cultural, historical, or scientific significance of the proposed domestic exhibition of the domestic-owned objects. It would not be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> An American museum is organizing an exhibition of works by 20th century American artists, which will travel to one other U.S. museum. There are more than 100 objects in the exhibition. The majority of the paintings, drawings and sculpture, valued at more than $500,000,000, are from galleries, museums and private collections in the United States. The organizing curator has selected ten works of art, mostly drawings and preparatory sketches relating to paintings in the exhibition, valued at less than $5,000,000, which will be borrowed from foreign lenders.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Discussion.</E> (i) This example raises the question of whether this applicant should submit an application for indemnity coverage for a domestic exhibition or an international exhibition. If the applicant submitted an application for an international exhibition requesting coverage for only the foreign-owned objects eligible under Section 1160.4(a), the Federal Council would evaluate whether the ten foreign-owned objects further the exhibition's educational, cultural, historical, or scientific purposes. It would also be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest. In this case, the applicant would have to insure the loans of the domestic-owned objects by other means.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of an application for an international exhibition requesting coverage for both domestic-owned and foreign-owned objects eligible under section 1160.4(a) and (c), the Federal Council would evaluate the exhibition as a whole to determine if the ten foreign-owned objects are integral to achieving the exhibition's educational, cultural, historical, or scientific purposes. It would also be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the applicant submitted an application for a domestic exhibition, however, only the loans of domestic-owned objects, the highest valued part of the exhibition, would be eligible for coverage. The Federal Council would consider if the U.S. loans were of educational, cultural or historic interest. It would not be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest. In this case, the applicant would have to insure the loans of the foreign-owned objects by other means.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1168.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
                <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

                <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 1168.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.<PRTPAGE P="442"/>

                <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>
                <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
                <P>(e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
                <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for determining if an individual is the subject of an NEH record.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) NEH has published notice of its systems of records in the <E T="04">Federal <PRTPAGE P="449"/>Register</E> and also has made such information available on the privacy program page of the NEH website. Any individual desiring to know whether a specific system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her should address such inquiries in writing to the Office of the General Counsel at the email or physical address identified in § 1169.3.</P>
              <P>(b) The written inquiry described in § 1169.4(a) should refer to the specific system or systems of records listed in the NEH Notice of Systems of Records, or describe the type of record in sufficient detail reasonably to identify the relevant system of records.</P>
              <P>(c) At a minimum, the request should contain sufficient identifying information to allow NEH to determine if there is a record pertaining to the individual making the request in a particular system of records. NEH reserves the right to solicit from an individual submitting such inquiry proof of identification, depending upon the sensitivity of the request.</P>
              <P>(d) NEH will attempt to respond to an inquiry regarding whether a record exists within 10 business days of receiving the inquiry, or 10 business days from the time any required identification is established, whichever is later. Such a response will contain or reference the procedures that the individual must follow in order to gain access to any such records.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1169.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for acquiring access to NEH records pertaining to an individual.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An individual may request access to his or her own records contained within an NEH system of records by writing to the Office of the General Counsel at the email or physical address identified in § 1169.3. The individual making the request should include his or her full name, address, email address, and telephone number. The individual making the request should also specifically indicate whether he or she wishes to review such records in person.</P>
              <P>(b) The request for access to a record within a system of records should refer to the specific system or systems of records listed in the NEH Notice of Systems of Records within which NEH may retrieve the individual's records, or describe the type of record in sufficient detail such that NEH may reasonably identify the relevant system of records. The request should further state that it is made pursuant to the Privacy Act. In addition, the request should include any other information which may permit NEH to identify the record for which access is being requested, such as maiden name, dates of employment, etc.</P>
              <P>(c) Where an individual requests records pertaining to himself or herself, NEH will process such request under both these regulations and NEH's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), set forth in 45 CFR part 1171, so as to provide the greatest degree of lawful access.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon receipt of any such request, NEH will determine whether the records identified by the requester exist and whether they are subject to any exemption under § 1169.10. Should NEH determine that the records are releasable under the Privacy Act and these regulations, and upon verifying the individual's identity per § 1169.6, NEH will provide access to copies of the records by transmitting them to the requester at the mailing or email address provided by the requester, or by permitting the requester to inspect the records at NEH's offices should the requester ask for in-person inspection or where the requester is a current NEH employee.</P>
              <P>(e) NEH will acknowledge a request for access as soon as practicable, and in no event in less than 5 business days. Consistent with the agency's FOIA regulations, NEH will otherwise substantively answer a request for access in no less than 20 business days, except when NEH determines otherwise, in which case NEH will inform the person making the request of the reasons for the delay and the estimated date by which NEH will answer the request. When NEH can answer the request within 20 business days, the response shall include the following:</P>

              <P>(1) A statement that there is no record as requested or a statement that there is no such record in the systems of records maintained by NEH;<PRTPAGE P="450"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A statement as to whether NEH will grant access by providing a copy of the record through the mail or email; or, where an individual requests in-person inspection, the address of the location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In the event the person requesting access is unable to meet the specified date and time, he or she may make alternative arrangements with NEH;</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of fees charged, if any (see § 1169.9);</P>
              <P>(4) Any documentation required by NEH to verify the identity of the person making the request.</P>
              <P>(f) NEH will provide only one copy of each requested record, based on the fee schedule in § 1169.9.</P>
              <P>(g) Per 5 U.S.C. 552a(h), a parent of a minor, upon presenting suitable personal identification, may act on behalf of the minor to gain access to any record pertaining to the minor maintained by NEH in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon the presentation of the documents authorizing the legal guardian to so act, and upon suitable personal identification of the guardian.</P>
              <P>(h) In the event NEH gains access to a record by permitting in-person inspection, the individual to which the record pertains may be accompanied by a person of his or her choice to review the record. Under such circumstances, NEH may require that the individual who is the subject of the record furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of the record in the accompanying person's presence.</P>
              <P>(i) In accordance with this provision, NEH will disclose medical or psychological records pertaining to an individual to whom they pertain unless NEH determines, in consultation with a physician, that disclosure of such records might adversely affect the individual to whom they pertain. Under these circumstances, NEH will disclose this information to a licensed physician designated by such individual in writing.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Identification required when requesting access to NEH records pertaining to an individual.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Before granting access to personal information under the Privacy Act, NEH may require that the individual requesting such access provide reasonable proof of his or her identity.</P>
              <P>(b) Except in the case of NEH employees and those individuals who request in-person inspection, NEH generally will endeavor to provide access to records via mail or email. In such instances, NEH will first confirm that the physical and/or email addresses provided by the requester match those contained with the NEH system of records. Depending upon the sensitivity of the records requested, and whether the addresses match as described in the preceding sentence, NEH may also request that the individual verify his or her identity by providing certain minimum identifying data, such as date or place of birth and/or copies of a valid driver's license or passport. Where the information sought is of a particularly sensitive nature, and/or where the individual cannot provide minimum identifying data, NEH may require that the individual seeking access submit a notarized statement of identity or a signed statement asserting and acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine of up to $5,000.</P>
              <P>(c) NEH will provide access by in-person examination to NEH employees as well as to individuals who specifically request disclosure in person. In such instances, the individual requesting disclosure may prove identity by producing an employee identification card, driver's license, or other license, permit or pass used for routine identification purposes. If the individual is unable to provide suitable documentation or identification, NEH may require that he or she stipulate, in writing, that knowingly or willingly seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</P>
              <P>(d) Identity verification procedures shall not:<PRTPAGE P="451"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Be so complicated as to discourage unnecessarily individuals from seeking access to information about themselves;</P>
              <P>(2) Be required of an individual seeking access to records that normally would be available under FOIA (see 45 CFR part 1171);</P>
              <P>(3) Require, as a condition to access, the provision of a social security number, unless a social security number is the only means by which NEH may retrieve the records that are the subject of the request.</P>
              <P>(4) Require that the individual explain or justify his or her need for access to any record under this part.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1169.7</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for amending or correcting an individual's NEH record.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Individuals are entitled to request amendments or corrections of records pertaining to themselves pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Normally, amendments to this part are limited to correcting factual matters and not matters of official judgment, such as grant proposal evaluations, performance ratings, promotion potential, and job performance appraisals. An individual seeking action under this provision bears the burden of demonstrating to NEH that a record should be amended or corrected.</P>
              <P>(b) Individuals may request the amendment of records pertaining to themselves by submitting a letter in writing to the NEH Office of the General Counsel at the email or physical address identified in § 1169.3. Such letter shall include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Identification of the particular record to be amended or corrected;</P>
              <P>(2) The NEH system from which the record was retrieved;</P>
              <P>(3) The precise correction or amendment sought, preferably in the form of an edited copy of the record reflecting the desired modification;</P>
              <P>(4) Reasons for requesting amendment or correction of the record, including copies of available documentary evidence supporting the request, where applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) NEH will acknowledge a request for amendment or correction as soon as practicable, and in no event less than 5 business days.</P>
              <P>(d) When NEH has previously verified the individual's identity pursuant to § 1169.6(b) or § 1169.6(c), it will not require further verification of identity so long as the request for amendment or correction does not suggest a need for additional verification. If NEH has not previously verified the individual's identity, it may require that the individual validate his or her identity as described in § 1169.6(b) or § 1169(c).</P>
              <P>(e) To the extent possible, NEH will render a decision upon a request to amend a record no less than 20 business days after receiving such a request. In the event NEH cannot render a decision within that time frame, it will so inform the individual who made the request and provide an expected date for a decision. Any such decision will include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) NEH's decision whether to grant in whole, or deny any part of, the request to amend or correct the record;</P>
              <P>(2) The reasons for the determination for any portion of the request which is denied;</P>
              <P>(3) A statement that any denial may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 1169.8; and</P>
              <P>(4) The name and address of the official to whom an individual may submit an appeal of denial.</P>
              <P>(f) NEH will forward requests to amend or correct a record governed by the regulations of another agency to such agency for processing, and inform the person who submitted such request in writing of its referral.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The appeals process.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An individual whose request for access to, or correction or amendment of, a record is initially denied by NEH and who wishes to appeal that denial may do so by sending a letter within 90 days of receipt of the initial denial to the Chairperson. If an appeal concerns records retrieved from the OIG's Investigative Files, the OIG will act on the appeal and will carry out all responsibilities with respect to Privacy Act appeals otherwise assigned to the Chairperson under this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The appeal letter must:</P>
              <P>(1) Specify the records subject to the appeal;<PRTPAGE P="452"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Include the information specified in § 1169.7(b);</P>
              <P>(3) Include copies of the correspondence from NEH in which it initially denied the request for access, or for amendment or correction; and</P>
              <P>(4) Explain why NEH's denial of access, amendment or correction was erroneous.</P>
              <P>(b) Appeals should be directed to the NEH Office of the General Counsel at the physical address or email address identified in § 1169.3. The Office of the General Counsel will refer the appeal letter to the Chairperson (or his or his or her designee), or in the case of records retrieved from NEH's OIG Investigative Files, will refer the appeal letter to the NEH OIG.</P>
              <P>(c) The Chairperson will review the initial request for access to, or amendment or correction of, the record, NEH's refusal, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal. NEH will not hold a hearing on the appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) The Chairperson will render a final decision on the appeal within 30 business days of its receipt by NEH, unless the Chairperson, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period. Should the Chairperson extend the 30-day period, NEH will inform the requester of the extension and the circumstances of the delay.</P>
              <P>(e) In conducting appeals under this provision, the Chairperson will be guided by the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) and (e)(5).</P>
              <P>(f) NEH will notify a requester, in writing, when the Chairperson determines to grant an appeal in whole or in part, and will grant the requester access to his or her record, or correct or amend the record, in accordance with the Chairperson's determination.</P>
              <P>(g) When the Chairperson determines to deny an appeal, in whole or in part, NEH will notify the requester in writing of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The basis for the decision;</P>
              <P>(2) That the requester may submit to NEH a concise statement setting forth the reasons for disagreeing with NEH's decision.</P>
              <P>(3) The procedures for filing such statement of disagreement.</P>
              <P>(4) That, in a case where the Chairperson refuses a request to amend or correct a record, NEH will make such statements of disagreement available in subsequent disclosures of the record, together with a statement from NEH (if deemed appropriate) summarizing the agency's refusal.</P>
              <P>(5) The requester's right to seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(a).</P>

              <P>(a) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the NEH system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except for subsections (b); (c)(1) and (2); (e)(4)(A) through (F); (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11); and (i), insofar as that NEH system contains information pertaining to criminal law enforcement investigations. NEH has implemented this exemption because application of these provisions of the Privacy Act might alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations; lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence; disclose investigative techniques or procedures; reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses; or otherwise impair investigations.</P>

              <P>(b) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the NEH system entitled “Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files” shall be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), insofar as that NEH system consists of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material <PRTPAGE P="453"/>within the scope of the exemption at 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) Pursuant to and limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the NEH system entitled “Grants and Cooperative Agreements: Electronic Grant Management System” shall be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), insofar as that NEH system consists of materials which would reveal the identity of references for fellowship or grant applicants.</P>
              <P>(d) Records on applicants for employment at NEH are covered by the Office of Personnel Management government-wide system notice “Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records.” These records are exempted as claimed in 5 CFR 297.501(b)(7).</P>
              <P>(e) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5), nothing within these regulations shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
              <P>(f) NEH may also assert exemptions for records received from another agency that could properly be claimed by that agency in responding to a request.</P>

              <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3), any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record from NEH concerning an individual under false pretenses shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.</P>

                <P>(a) The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the activities funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.</P>
                <P>(1) A publication or a museum catalogue supported by the Endowment may be made usable by the blind and the visually impaired through cassette tapes, records, discs, braille, readers and simultaneous publications.</P>
                <P>(2) A lecture, meeting or symposium supported by Federal funds may be made available to deaf and hearing impaired persons through the use of a sign language interpreter or by providing scripts in advance of the performance.</P>
                <P>(3) Specific aid, benefits, or services supported by Federal funds may be offered in an inaccessible facility provided that the same aid, benefit, or service is also offered to the public at large in an accessible space.</P>
                <P>(4) A qualified handicapped person is one who is able to meet all requirements in spite of his handicap. An educational institution is not required to disregard the disabilities of handicapped individuals or to lower or to make substantial modifications of standards to accommodate a handicapped person.</P>
                <P>(b) State humanities committees are obligated to develop methods of administering Federal funds so as to ensure that handicapped persons are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of handicap either by sub-grantees or by the manner in which the funds are distributed.</P>
                <P>(c) In the event Endowment funds are utilized to construct, expand, alter, lease or rent a facility, the benefits of the program or activity provided in or through that facility must be conducted in accordance with these regulations, e.g., a museum receiving a grant to renovate an existing facility must assure that all museum aid, benefits, or services conducted in that facility are accessible to handicapped persons.</P>
                <P>(d) In carrying out the mandate of section 504 and these implementing regulations recipients should administer Endowment assisted programs or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate, e.g., tours made available to the hearing impaired should be open to the public at large and everyone should be permitted to enjoy the benefits of a tactile experience in a museum.</P>

A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.</P>

                <P>(b) If a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination, if a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity, or if a recipient is taking affirmative action under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate <PRTPAGE P="459"/>whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided, that:</P>
                <P>(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and</P>
                <P>(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.</P>
                <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided, that:</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part contains the regulations the NEH follows in processing requests for NEH records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. The NEH also follows these regulations to process all FOIA requests made to the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities (FCAH), an organization established by the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 for which the NEH provides legal counsel. These regulations should be read together with the FOIA and OMB's Free Guidelines, which provides additional information about access to NEH and FCAH records. FOIA applies to requests for records concerning the general activities of the government and of the NEH in particular. When individuals seek records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, NEH processes those requests under both NEH's Privacy regulations at part 1115 of this chapter, and this part. Although requests are considered either FOIA requests or Privacy Act requests, agencies process requests in accordance with both laws, which provides the greatest degree of lawful access while safeguarding an individual's personal privacy.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Information policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The NEH may provide information the agency routinely makes available to the public through its regular activities (for example, program announcements and solicitations, press releases, and summaries of awarded grant applications) without following this part. As a matter of policy, the NEH makes discretionary disclosures of records or information otherwise exempt under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. This policy, however, does not create any right enforceable in court.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Public availability of records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the NEH will make the following records available for public inspection in an electronic format (unless they are published and copies are offered for sale) without a FOIA request:</P>
              <P>(1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders made in the adjudication of cases,</P>

              <P>(2) Statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>,</P>
              <P>(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public,</P>
              <P>(4) Copies of all records, regardless of format, which have been released to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and which because of their subject matter, the NEH determines have become or are likely to become subject to subsequent requests for substantially the same records, or have been requested three (3) or more times; and</P>
              <P>(5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The NEH will also maintain and make available for public inspection in an electronic format current indexes as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) of the FOIA. However, since the NEH has determined that publication and distribution of these indexes is unnecessary and impracticable, the NEH will provide these indexes upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of the duplication.</P>

              <P>(c) NEH proactively identifies records of interest to the public, such as past awards, press releases, grant guidelines, and grant terms and conditions, and makes these records available on the NEH's Web site at <PRTPAGE P="467"/>
                <E T="03">www.neh.gov.</E> In addition, copies of the NEH's policy statements, information about the NEH's FOIA program, sample grant narratives, and other frequently requested records are available in the NEH's Electronic Library.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">How to make a request.</E> Your FOIA request need not be in any particular format, but it must be in writing, include your full name, mailing address, daytime telephone number. If you choose to submit your request on the NEH Web site, the request must also include your email address. Your request should be clearly identified as a FOIA request in both the text of the request and on the envelope (or on the facsimile or in the subject heading of an email message) and must describe the requested records in enough detail to enable NEH staff to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. The NEH has no obligation to answer questions posed as FOIA requests or to create records to satisfy a FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> If you make a FOIA request, the NEH will consider it an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under this part, subject to the fee limitations of § 1171.11(d). When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Where to send a request.</E> (1) For NEH records (except NEH Office of the Inspector General records) and/or FCAH records, write to: The General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, National Endowment for the Humanities, 400 7th Street SW., Room 4060, Washington, DC, 20506. You may also send your request to the NEH General Counsel by facsimile at 202-606-8600, by email at <E T="03">gencounsel@neh.gov,</E> or through the NEH's electronic FOIA request system, which is available on the NEH Web site at <E T="03">www.neh.gov.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) For NEH Office of the Inspector General records, write to: The Inspector General, Office of the Inspector General, National Endowment for the Humanities, 400 7th Street SW., Room 2200, Washington, DC 20506. You may also send your request to the Inspector General by facsimile at 202-606-8329 or by email at <E T="03">oig@neh.gov.</E>

              <SUBJECT>Responsibilities for processing and responding to requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Processing requests.</E> The NEH Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is the central office for processing requests for records, except when it's necessary for the NEH Office of Inspector General (OIG) to process a request to maintain the OIG's independence or ability to carry out its statutorily mandated duties. If the request is for OIG records, the NEH will inform the requester which office will be processing the request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The NEH General Counsel (or designee) is authorized to grant or deny requests for NEH records (excluding requests for OIG records), and/or FCAH records. The NEH Deputy Inspector General (or designee) is authorized to grant or deny requests for OIG records. The NEH General Counsel (or designee) is authorized to grant or deny requests on any fee matters and requests for expedited treatment, including OIG-related requests.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals.</E> When the NEH receives a request for a record in its possession, the agency will determine whether another Federal government agency is better able to decide whether the record should or should not be disclosed under the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.</P>
              <P>(1) If the NEH determines that it is the agency best able to process the record in response to the request, then it will do so, after consultation with the other agency that has a substantial interest in the requested records.</P>

              <P>(2) If the NEH determines that it is not the agency best able to process the record, then it will refer the record (or portion thereof) to the other Federal agency, but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA.<PRTPAGE P="468"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> Whenever the NEH refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, the NEH will notify the requester of the referral, provide the name of the agency to which the referral was directed, and include that agency's FOIA contact information. NEH will notify the requester of the part of the request that has been referred, unless such notification would disclose information otherwise exempt. If notification to the requester about the referral would cause a harm meant to be protected against by the FOIA, NEH will coordinate with the agency rather than referring the records to it.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The NEH customarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the NEH will include only those records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the NEH will inform the requester of that date.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Timing for initial response.</E> Ordinarily, the NEH will determine whether to grant or deny a request for records within twenty (20) days (weekends and Federal holidays excluded) of when the NEH receives a request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tolling of time limits.</E> The NEH may toll the 20-day time period to:</P>
              <P>(1) Make one request for information it reasonably requests from the requester; or</P>
              <P>(2) Clarify the applicability or amount of any fees, if necessary, with the requester.</P>
              <P>(3) Under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section, the tolling period ends upon the NEH's receipt of the information or clarification from the requester.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> (1) When the NEH cannot meet the statutory time limits for processing a request because of unusual circumstances as defined in the FOIA, the NEH may extend the response time as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the extension will be for ten (10) or fewer working days (i.e., weekends and Federal holidays excluded), the NEH will notify the requester as soon as practicable in writing of the unusual circumstances and the expected response date; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the extension will be for more than ten (10) working days, the NEH will provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limit or to arrange an alternative time period to process the request or a modified request. To aid the requester, NEH shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the agency, and shall notify the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
              <P>(2) If the NEH reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, the NEH may aggregate the requests. The NEH will not aggregate multiple requests involving unrelated matters.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) The NEH will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it determines that they involve:</P>
              <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal government activity if the expedited processing request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>
              <P>(2) A requester may seek expedited processing at the time of the requester's initial request for records or at any later time.</P>
              <P>(3) To request expedited processing, a requester must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the requester's best knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>

              <P>(4) Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the NEH will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If the NEH grants a request for expedited processing, the <PRTPAGE P="469"/>NEH will place the request in the expedited processing track and then process the request as soon as practicable. If the NEH denies a request for expedited processing, the NEH will act upon any appeal of that decision expeditiously.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> If the NEH makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing of such determination and the reasons therefore, and the requester's right to seek assistance from NEH's FOIA Public Liaison. The NEH will inform the requester of any applicable fees and will disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fees. The NEH will mark or annotate records disclosed in part to show the amount of information deleted pursuant to a FOIA exemption, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption. If technically feasible, the NEH will also indicate, on the agency record(s) it provides, the location of the information deleted.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Denials of requests.</E> If the NEH makes a determination to deny a request in any respect, the NEH will also notify the requester in writing of:</P>
              <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
              <P>(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the NEH in denying the request;</P>
              <P>(3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, if applicable, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletion on the records disclosed in part, or if providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
              <P>(4) The requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from NEH's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Confidential commercial information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The NEH will not disclose confidential commercial information in response to a FOIA request, except as described in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by the NEH from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity from whom the NEH obtains confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> A submitter of confidential commercial information will use good-faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">When notice to submitters is required.</E> (1) The NEH will give notice to a submitter whenever:</P>
              <P>(i) The submitter, in good faith, has designated the requested information as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The NEH has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</P>

              <P>(2) The notice will either describe the confidential commercial information <PRTPAGE P="470"/>requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the NEH may make notice by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of this section will not apply if:</P>
              <P>(1) The NEH determines that the requested information is exempt under the FOIA;</P>
              <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or</P>
              <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the NEH will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> (1) The NEH will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it must submit a detailed written statement to the NEH specifying all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of the FOIA. If the submitter relies on Exemption 4 as a basis of nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.</P>
              <P>(2) The NEH will consider a submitter who fails to respond with the time period specified on the notice to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The NEH will not consider information it receives from a submitter after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this section may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The NEH will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose confidential commercial information. Whenever the NEH decides to disclose confidential commercial information over the objection of a submitter, the NEH will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</P>
              <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time after the notice.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the NEH will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Requester notification.</E> The NEH will notify the requester whenever the NEH provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever the NEH notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>

You may also send your appeal to the NEH General Counsel by facsimile at 202-606-8600, by email at <E T="03">gencounsel@neh.gov,</E> or through the NEH's electronic FOIA request system, which is available on the NEH Web site at <E T="03">www.neh.gov.</E> For a denial of your request for OIG records, you may appeal by facsimile at 202-606-8329, by email at <E T="03">oig@neh.gov</E> or by mail to The Inspector General, National Endowment for the Humanities, 400 7th Street SW., Room 2200, Washington, DC 20506. Your appeal must be in writing and received by NEH within ninety (90) days of the date of the letter denying your request in whole or in part. Your appeal letter must clearly identify the NEH decision that you are appealing <PRTPAGE P="471"/>and contain the tracking number, if assigned. You should clearly mark your appeal letter and envelope “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> The Deputy Chairman (or designee) or the Inspector General (or designee) will make a written determination on your appeal within twenty (20) days (weekends and Federal holidays excluded) after the agency receives your appeal, except as provided by 1171.7(d). If the appeal decision affirms the denial of your request, the NEH will notify you in writing of the reason(s) for the decision, including the applicable FOIA exemption(s), and inform you of the FOIA provisions for court review of the decision. If the denial of your request is reversed or modified, in whole or in part, the NEH will reprocess your request in accordance with that appeal decision and notify you of that decision in writing. A response to an appeal will advise the requester that the 2007 amendments to FOIA created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. A requester may contact OGIS in any of the following ways: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road—OGIS, College Park, MD 20740; <E T="03">https://ogis.archives.gov;</E> email: <E T="03">ogis@nara.gov;</E> telephone: 202-741-5770; facsimile: 202-741-5769; toll-free: 1-877-684-6448.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The NEH will assess fees for processing FOIA requests in accordance with this section and with the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget at 52 FR 10012 (Mar. 27, 1987). In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the NEH may contact a requester for additional information. The NEH ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because the NEH has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, the NEH will provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenses that an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records among others.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) above, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the <PRTPAGE P="472"/>results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use or to promote any particular product or industry, but are sought to further scientific research.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or by subscription or by free distribution to the general public. The NEH will regard “freelance” journalists as working for a news-media organization if they demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication though that organization. A publication contract would provide the clearest evidence, but the NEH will also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. It also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1171.9, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. Review costs are recoverable even if the NEH ultimately does not disclose a record.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records. The NEH will ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, the NEH will charge the following fees for requests, subject to paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Search.</E> (i) The NEH will charge $4.00 for each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for and retrieving a requested record. When clerical personnel cannot perform the search and retrieval (e.g. identification of records within scope of request requires professional personnel), the NEH will charge $7.00 for each quarter hour of search time spent by professional personnel. Where the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee will be $10.00 for each quarter hour of time spent by those personnel. The NEH may charge for time spent searching even if it does not locate any responsive records or if it determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
              <P>(ii) For computer searches of records, the NEH will charge the actual direct cost of conducting the search.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> The fee for a photocopy of a record on one-side of an 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 inch sheet of paper is ten cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other electronic media, the NEH will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. For other forms of duplication, the NEH will charge the direct costs of that duplication. The NEH will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the NEH in the form or format requested.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> The NEH will charge review fees to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review (i.e., the review the NEH conducted to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion at the initial request stage). No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage for exemptions applied at the initial <PRTPAGE P="473"/>review stage. However, if the NEH re-reviews the records for the applicability of other exemptions that it did not previously consider, then the costs for the subsequent review are assessable. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(i). The NEH may charge for review even if it ultimately decides not to disclose a record.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations on charging requesters.</E> (1) Except for requesters seeking records for commercial use, the NEH will provide without charge:</P>
              <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).</P>
              <P>(2) When, after first deducting the 100 pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, the total fee is $25.00 or less for any request, the NEH will not charge a fee.</P>
              <P>(3) If NEH fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If NEH has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and NEH has provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional ten (10) working days.</P>
              <P>(ii) If NEH has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, NEH may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section, may charge duplication fees, provided NEH provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and NEH discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).</P>
              <P>(iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Categories of requesters.</E> There are four categories of FOIA requesters: commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The NEH will assess fees for these categories of requesters as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> The NEH will charge the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> The NEH will charge for duplication only, excluding costs for the first 100 pages.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">News media requesters.</E> The NEH will charge for duplication only, excluding costs for the first 100 pages.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> The NEH will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records, excluding costs for the first 100 pages and the first two hours of search time.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Requirements for fee waivers or reduction of fees.</E> (1) The NEH will furnish responsive records without charge or at a reduced charge if it determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:</P>
              <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>(2) To determine whether the first fee requirement is met, the NEH will consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>

              <P>(ii) The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully <PRTPAGE P="474"/>informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of information already in the public domain, in either duplicative or substantially identical form, is unlikely to contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
              <P>(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as his or her ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. It will ordinarily be presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.</P>
              <P>(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. The NEH will make no value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.</P>
              <P>(3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, the NEH will consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) The NEH will identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
              <P>(ii) A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure.</P>
              <P>(4) Where only some of the requested records satisfy the requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver will be granted for those records.</P>
              <P>(5) Requesters should make fee waiver or reduction requests when they first submit a FOIA request to the NEH. Fee waiver or reduction requests should address the factors listed in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section. Fee waiver or reduction requests may be submitted at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> (1) When the NEH determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section will exceed $25.00, it will notify the requester of the actual or estimated fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If the NEH can only readily estimate a portion of the fees, it will advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice will offer the requester an opportunity to confer with NEH personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost and inform the requester of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if applicable. A commitment by the requester to pay the anticipated fee must be in writing and must be received by the NEH within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notification of the fee estimate. Until the requester agrees to pay the anticipated fee, the NEH will not consider the request as received by the agency and no further work will be done on the request. If a requester fails to respond within this timeframe, the NEH will administratively close the request.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> When the NEH chooses, in its sole discretion, to provide a requested special service (e.g. certifying that records are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail), it will charge the direct costs of providing the service to the requester.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The NEH may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. The NEH will assess interest charges at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and such charges will accrue from the billing date until the NEH receives payment from the requester. The NEH will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section, the <PRTPAGE P="475"/>NEH will not require the requester to make an advance payment before it commences or continues work on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.</P>
              <P>(2) When the NEH determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester that has a history of prompt payment.</P>
              <P>(3) When a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged fee to the NEH within thirty (30) days of the billing date, the NEH may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before the NEH begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester.</P>
              <P>(4) When there is an advance payment request, the NEH will not consider the request as received by the agency and no further work will be done on the request until the required payment is received. If the requester fails to respond within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the advance payment request, the NEH will administratively close the request.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> When the NEH reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the NEH may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The NEH may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the NEH will aggregate them only when there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. The NEH will not aggregate multiple requests involving unrelated matters.</P>

                <P>The purpose of this part is to set out the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) policies and procedures for implementing the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6101 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> (the Act or the Age Act). The Act is designed to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act also permits federally assisted programs or activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use certain age distinctions and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part. The regulations in this part are based upon the general, government-wide age discrimination regulations issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at 45 CFR part 90. Complaints of employment discrimination based on age may be subject to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 621 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> (ADEA) and should be filed administratively with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) (29 CFR part 1626).</P>

                <P>(b) The Act does not apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) Any age distinction contained in that part of a Federal, State or local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body which:</P>
                <P>(i) Provides any benefits or assistance to persons based on age;</P>
                <P>(ii) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Describes intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-related terms.</P>
                <P>(2) Any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or with respect to any labor-management joint apprenticeship training program.</P>
                <P>(3) The rights or responsibilities of any person or party pursuant to the ADEA, the EEOC regulations under the ADEA, or any statements of policy promulgated by the EEOC under the ADEA.</P>

                <P>(c) NEH will not take action under § 1172.36(a) until:</P>

The Chairman will file such report whenever it takes action under § 1172.36(a).</P>
                <P>(d) NEH also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to a recipient when a hearing under § 1172.36(a)(1) is initiated.</P>
                <P>(1) New Federal financial assistance includes all assistance for which NEH requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period.

                <P>(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right, to bring a civil action for injunctive relief, and</P>
                <P>(3) Inform the complainant:</P>
                <P>(i) That a civil action can only be brought in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is found or transacts business,</P>
                <P>(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that these costs must be demanded in the complaint,</P>
                <P>(iii) That before commencing the action, the complainant must give thirty (30) days' notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, the Chairman, and the recipient,</P>
                <P>(iv) That the notice must state the alleged violation of the Act, the relief requested, the court in which the complainant is bringing the action, and, whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails, and</P>
                <P>(v) That no action may be brought if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.</P>

              <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1175.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
              <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>
              <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1175.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section <PRTPAGE P="486"/>through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
              <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
              <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

              <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
              <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
              <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>

              <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1175.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Many individuals in society possess great productive potential which goes unrealized because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard workweek. Permanent part-time employment also provides benefits to other individuals in a variety of ways, such as providing older individuals with a gradual transition into retirement, providing employment opportunities to handicapped individuals or others who require a reduced workweek, providing parents with opportunities to balance family responsibilities with the need for added income, and assisting students who must finance their own education or vocational training. In view of this, the National Endowment for the Humanities will operate a part-time career employment program, consistent with its responsibilities and in accordance with Public Law 95-437, the Federal Employees' Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Program Coordinator.</E> The Personnel Officer is responsible for program operation and coordination.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Part-time employment</E> means employment of 16 to 32 hours a week under a schedule consisting of an equal or varied number of hours per day, whether in a position which would be part-time without regard to the Act or one established to allow job-sharing or comparable arrangements, but does not include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.</P>

              <P>Positions becoming vacant, unless excepted as provided by § 1176.8, will be reviewed to determine the feasibility of converting them to part-time. Among the criteria which may be used when conducting this review are:</P>
              <P>(a) Mission requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) Workload.</P>

              <P>Position management and other internal reviews may indicate that positions may be either converted from full-time or initially established as part-time positions. Criteria listed in § 1176.3 may be used during these reviews. If a decision is made to convert to or to establish a part-time position, regular position management and classification procedures will be followed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annual plan.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) An agencywide plan for promoting part-time employment opportunities will be developed annually. This plan <PRTPAGE P="489"/>will establish annual goals and set interim and final deadlines for achieving these goals. This plan will be applicable throughout the agency, and will be transmitted to the Office of Personnel Management with the required report to OPM on the status of the program as of September 30 of each year.</P>
              <P>(b) Beginning in FY 1981 in administering personnel ceilings, part-time career employees shall be counted against ceiling authorizations as a fraction. This will be determined by dividing 40 hours into the average number of hours of such employee's regularly scheduled workweek.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Publicizing vacancies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When applicants from outside the Federal service are desired, part-time vacanies may be publicized through various recruiting means, such as:</P>
              <P>(a) Federal Job Information Centers.</P>
              <P>(b) State Employment Offices.</P>

              <P>(a) The Personnel Officer may except positions from inclusion in this program to provide fewer than 16 hours per week. This will normally be done in furtherance of special hiring programs such as the Stay-in-School or Handicapped Employment Program.</P>
              <P>(b) On occasions when it becomes necessary to allow supervisors and managers to temporarily increase the hours of duty of employees above 32 hours per week for limited and specific periods of time to meet heavy workloads, perform special assignments, permit employee training, etc., the Endowment policy is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Requests to work NEH employees on a 32 hour/week appointment more than 32 hours must be submitted in advance to the Personnel Office;</P>
              <P>(2) Justification should be concise but specific and must state the exact time frame for the increase in hours above 32 hours per week; and</P>
              <P>(3) The Program Coordinator will decide if the request meets the intent of the law and this agency's policy.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Claim</E> or <E T="03">debt</E> means an amount of property owed to the United States. These include but are not limited to: Overpayments to program beneficiaries; overpayments to contractors and grantees, including overpayments arising from audit disallowances; excessive cash advances to grantees and contractors; and civil penalties and assessments. A debt is overdue or delinquent if it is not paid by the due date specified in the initial notice of the debt (see § 1177.6 of this part) or if the debtor fails to satisfy his or her obligation under a repayment agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Debtor</E> means an individual, organization, group, association, partnership, or corporation indebted to the United States, or the person or entity with legal responsibility for assuming the debtor's obligation.</P>

              <P>The remedies and sanctions available to the National Endowment for the Humanities under this part are not intended to be exclusive. The Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities or his designee may impose other appropriate sanctions upon a debtor for prolonged or repeated failure to pay a debt. For example, the Chairperson or his designee may place the debtor's name on a list of debarred, suspended, or ineligible grantees and contractors, convert the method of payment under a grant from an advance to a reimbursement method, or revoke a grantee's letter of credit. In such cases the debtor will be advised of the Endowment's action.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Claims involving criminal activity or misconduct.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A debtor whose indebtedness involves criminal activity such as fraud, embezzlement, theft, or misuse of government funds or property is subject to punishment by fine or imprisonment as well as to a civil claim by the United States for compensation for the misappropriated funds. The Endowment will refer these cases to the appropriate law enforcement agency for prosecution.</P>
              <P>(b) Debts involving fraud, false, claims, or misrepresentation shall not be compromised, terminated, suspended, or otherwise disposed of under this rule. Only the Department of Justice is authorized to compromise, terminate, suspend, or otherwise dispose of such debts.</P>

Collection efforts shall include sending to the debtor's last known address a total of three progressively stronger written demands for payment at not more than 30 day intervals. When necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate action, including immediate referral for litigation. Other contact with the debtor or his or her representative or guarantor by telephone, in person and/or in writing may be appropriate to demand prompt payment, to discuss the debtor's position regarding the existence, amount and repayment of the debt, and to inform the debtor of his or her rights and the effect of nonpayment or delayed payment. A debtor who disputes a debt must promptly provide available supporting evidence.</P>
              <P>(b) If a debtor is involved in insolvency proceedings, the debt will be referred to the appropriate United States Attorney to file a claim. The United States may have a priority over other creditors under 31 U.S.C. 3713.</P>

The Endowment shall waive the collection of interest on the debt or any part of the debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue.</P>

              <P>(iii) If collection must be made in installments, the Chairperson must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment;</P>
              <P>(iv) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and provide the dates on which action was taken unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of procedures required by law.

              <P>(v) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Endowment must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the creditor agency. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or <PRTPAGE P="496"/>similar payments, it must certify to the agency responsible for making such payments the amount of the debt and that the provisions of this part have been followed; and</P>
              <P>(vi) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the Chairperson may request unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The Endowment as the paying agency.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a properly certified debt claim from another agency, deductions will be scheduled to begin at the next established pay interval.

The National Endowment for the Humanities shall not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity or the amount of the certified claim.</P>
              <P>(2) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor agency has submitted its debt claim to the National Endowment for the Humanities and before the debt is collected completely, the National Endowment for the Humanities must certify the total amount collected. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee. A copy must be furnished the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
              <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>
              <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1181.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan <PRTPAGE P="502"/>shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
              <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
              <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

              <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
              <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>

              <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
              <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1181.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for acquiring access to Institute records pertaining to an individual.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following procedures apply to records that are contained in an Institute system:</P>
              <P>(a) You may request review of records pertaining to you by writing to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1182.3). You also may call the Office of the General Counsel at (202) 653-4787 on business days, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., to schedule an appointment to make such a request in person. A request for records should be presented in writing and should identify specifically the Institute systems involved.</P>
              <P>(b) Access to the record, or to any other information pertaining to you that is contained in the system shall be provided if the identification requirements of § 1182.9 are satisfied and the record is determined otherwise to be releasable under the Privacy Act and these regulations. The Institute shall provide you an opportunity to have a copy made of any such record about you. Only one copy of each requested record will be supplied, based on the fee schedule in § 1182.12.</P>
              <P>(c) The Institute will comply promptly with requests made in person at scheduled appointments, if the requirements of this section are met and the records sought are immediately available. The institute will acknowledge, within 10 business days, mailed requests or personal requests for documents that are not immediately available, and the information requested will be provided promptly thereafter.</P>
              <P>(d) If you make your request in person at a scheduled appointment, you may, upon your request, be accompanied by a person of your choice to review your record. The Institute may require that you furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of your record in the accompanying person's presence. A record may be disclosed to a representative chosen by you upon your proper written consent.</P>
              <P>(e) Medical or psychological records pertaining to you shall be disclosed to you unless, in the judgment of the Institute, access to such records might have an adverse effect upon you. When such a determination has been made, the Institute may refuse to disclose such information directly to you. The Institute will, however, disclose this information to a licensed physician designated by you in writing.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1182.9</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Identification required when requesting access to Institute records pertaining to an individual.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Institute shall require reasonable identification of all individuals who request access to records in an Institute system to ensure that they are disclosed to the proper person.</P>

              <P>(a) The amount of personal identification required will of necessity vary with the sensitivity of the record involved. In general, if you request disclosure in person, you shall be required to show an identification card, such as a driver's license, containing your photograph and sample signature. However, with regard to records in Institute systems that contain particularly sensitive and/or detailed personal information, the Institute reserves the right to require additional means of <PRTPAGE P="507"/>identification as are appropriate under the circumstances. These means include, but are not limited to, requiring you to sign a statement under oath as to your identity, acknowledging that you are aware of the penalties for improper disclosure under the provisions of the Privacy Act.</P>
              <P>(b) If you request disclosure by mail, the Institute will request such information as may be necessary to ensure that you are properly identified. Authorized means to achieve this goal include, but are not limited to, requiring that a mail request include certification that a duly commissioned notary public of any State or territory (or a similar official, if the request is made outside of the United States) received an acknowledgment of identity from you.</P>
              <P>(c) If you are unable to provide suitable documentation or identification, the Institute may require a signed, notarized statement asserting your identity and stipulating that you understand that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for amending or correcting an individual's Institute record.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You are entitled to request amendments to or corrections of records pertaining to you pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Such a request should be made in writing and addressed to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1182.3).</P>
              <P>(b) Your request for amendments or corrections should specify the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The particular record that you are seeking to amend or correct;</P>
              <P>(2) The Institute system from which the record was retrieved;</P>
              <P>(3) The precise correction or amendment you desire, preferably in the form of an edited copy of the record reflecting the desired modification; and</P>
              <P>(4) Your reasons for requesting amendment or correction of the record.</P>
              <P>(c) The Institute will acknowledge a request for amendment or correction of a record within 10 business days of its receipt, unless the request can be processed and the individual informed of the General Counsel's decision on the request within that 10-day period.</P>
              <P>(d) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel agrees that the record is not accurate, timely, or complete, based on a preponderance of the evidence, then the record will be corrected or amended promptly. The record will be deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is not relevant or necessary to accomplish the Institute function for which the record was provided or is maintained. In either case, you will be informed in writing of the amendment, correction, or deletion. In addition, if accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>
              <P>(e) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel does not agree that the record should be amended or corrected, you will be informed promptly in writing of the refusal to amend or correct the record and the reason for this decision. You also will be informed that you may appeal this refusal in accordance with § 1182.11.</P>
              <P>(f) Requests to amend or correct a record governed by the regulations of another agency will be forwarded to such agency for processing, and you will be informed in writing of this referral.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1182.11</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for appealing a refusal to amend or correct an Institute record.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You may appeal a refusal to amend or correct a record to the Director. Such appeal must be made in writing within 10 business days of your receipt of the initial refusal to amend or correct your record. Your appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 1182.3), should indicate that it is an appeal, and should include the basis for the appeal.</P>
              <P>(b) The Director will review your request to amend or correct the record, the General Counsel's refusal, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal. No hearing will be held.</P>

              <P>(c) The Director shall render his or her decision on your appeal within 30 <PRTPAGE P="508"/>business days of its receipt by the Institute, unless the Director, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period. Should the Director extend the appeal period, you will be informed in writing of the extension and the circumstances of the delay.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Director determines that the record that is the subject of the appeal should be amended or corrected, the record will be so modified, and you will be informed in writing of the amendment or correction. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>
              <P>(e) If your appeal is denied, you will be informed in writing of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The denial and the reasons for the denial;</P>
              <P>(2) That you may submit to the Institute a concise statement setting forth the reasons for your disagreement as to the disputed record. Under the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, your statement will be disclosed whenever the disputed record is disclosed; and</P>
              <P>(3) That you may seek judicial review of the Director's determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(a).</P>
              <P>(f) Whenever you submit a statement of disagreement to the Institute in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the record will be annotated to indicate that it is disputed. In any subsequent disclosure, a copy of your statement of disagreement will be disclosed with the record. If the Institute deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the Director's reasons for denying our appeal also may be disclosed with the record. While you will have access to this statement of the Director's reasons for denying your appeal, such statement will not be subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be provided a copy of your statement of disagreement, as well as any statement of the Director's reasons for denying your appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fees charged to locate, review, or copy records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Institute shall charge no fees for search time or for any other time expended by the Institute to review a record. However, the Institute may charge fees where you request that a copy be made of a record to which you have been granted access. Where a copy of the record must be made in order to provide access to the record (e.g., computer printout where no screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to you without cost.</P>
              <P>(b) Copies of records made by photocopy or similar process will be charged to you at the rate of $0.10 per page. Where records are not susceptible to photocopying (e.g., punch cards, magnetic tapes, or oversize materials), you will be charged actual cost as determined on a case-by-case basis. A copying fee totaling $3.00 or less shall be waived, but the copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee.</P>
              <P>(c) Special and additional services provided at your request, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance, and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to you.</P>
              <P>(d) A copying fee shall not be charged or, alternatively, it may be reduced, when the General Counsel determines, based on a petition, that the petitioning individual is indigent and that the Institute's resources permit a waiver of all or part of the fee.</P>
              <P>(e) All fees shall be paid before any copying request is undertaken. Payments shall be made by check or money order payable to the “Institute of Museum and Library Services.”</P>

              <P>(2) Required under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Records required to be <PRTPAGE P="509"/>made available by the Freedom of Information Act will be released in response to a request to the Institute formulated in accordance with the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities regulations published at 45 CFR part 1184;</P>

              <P>(5) To a recipient who has provided the Institute with adequate advance written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;</P>
              <P>(6) To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record that has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States government, or for evaluation by the Archivist of the United States, or his or her designee, to determine whether the record has such value;</P>
              <P>(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity, if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Institute for such records specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought. The Institute also may disclose such a record to a law enforcement agency on its own initiative in situations in which criminal conduct is suspected, provided that such disclosure has been established as a routine use, or in situations in which the misconduct is directly related to the purpose for which the record is maintained;</P>
              <P>(8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if, upon such disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;</P>
              <P>(9) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdictions, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress, or subcommittee of any such joint committee;</P>

              <P>(12) Pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that any record is disclosed under such compulsory legal process, the Institute shall make reasonable efforts to notify the subject individual after the process becomes a matter of public record.</P>
              <P>(b) Before disseminating any record about any individual to any person other than an Institute employee, the Institute shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that such records are, or at the time they were collected were, accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for Institute purposes. This paragraph (b) does not apply to dissemination made pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>The Chief Information Officer has the responsibility of maintaining adequate technical, physical, and security safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or destruction of manual and automatic record systems. These security safeguards shall apply to all systems in which identifiable personal data are processed or maintained, including all reports and outputs from such systems that contain identifiable personal information. Such safeguards must be sufficient to prevent negligent, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification or destruction of any personal records or data, and must furthermore minimize, to the extent practicable, the risk that skilled technicians or knowledgeable persons could improperly obtain access to modify or destroy such records or data and shall further insure against such casual entry by unskilled persons without official reasons for access to such records or data.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Manual systems.</E> (1) Records contained in a system of records as defined in this part may be used, held, or stored only where facilities are adequate to prevent unauthorized access by persons within or outside the Institute.</P>
              <P>(2) All records, when not under the personal control of the employees authorized to use the records, must be stored in a locked filing cabinet. Some systems of records are not of such confidential nature that their disclosure would constitute a harm to an individual who is the subject of such record. However, records in this category also shall be maintained in locked filing cabinets or maintained in a secured room with a locking door.</P>
              <P>(3) Access to and use of a system of records shall be permitted only to persons whose duties require such access within the Institute, for routine uses as defined in § 1182.2 as to any given system, or for such other uses as may be provided in this part.</P>
              <P>(4) Other than for access within the Institute to persons needing such records in the performance of their official duties or routine uses as defined in § 1182.1, or such other uses as provided in this part, access to records within a system of records shall be permitted only to the individual to whom the record pertains or upon his or her written request to the General Counsel.</P>
              <P>(5) Access to areas where a system of records is stored will be limited to those persons whose duties require work in such areas. There shall be an accounting of the removal of any records from such storage areas utilizing a log, as directed by the Chief Information Officer. The log shall be maintained at all times.</P>
              <P>(6) The Institute shall ensure that all persons whose duties require access to and use of records contained in a system of records are adequately trained to protect the security and privacy of such records.</P>
              <P>(7) The disposal and destruction of records within a system of records shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the General Services Administration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Automated systems.</E> (1) Identifiable personal information may be processed, stored, or maintained by automated data systems only where facilities or conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access to such systems in any form. Whenever such data, whether contained in punch cards, magnetic tapes, or discs, are not under the personal control of an authorized person, such information must be stored in a locked or secured room, or in such other facility having greater safeguards than those provided for in this part.</P>

              <P>(2) Access to and use of identifiable personal data associated with automated data systems shall be limited to those persons whose duties require such access. Proper control of personal <PRTPAGE P="511"/>data in any form associated with automated data systems shall be maintained at all times, including maintenance of accountability records showing disposition of input and output documents.</P>
              <P>(3) All persons whose duties require access to processing and maintenance of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be adequately trained in the security and privacy of personal data.</P>
              <P>(4) The disposal and disposition of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be done by shredding, burning, or, in the case of tapes or discs, degaussing, in accordance with regulations of the General Services Administration or other appropriate authority.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the purpose and scope of this part?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part describe how the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) processes requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552 as amended. The regulations in this part apply only to records that are both:</P>
              <P>(1) Created or obtained by IMLS; and</P>
              <P>(2) Under the agency's control at the time of the FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(b) The rules in this part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Act Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under 45 CFR part 1182 as well as under this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1184.2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are IMLS's general policies with respect to FOIA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Presumption of openness.</E> IMLS administers the FOIA with a presumption of openness. Under this presumption, IMLS makes discretionary disclosures of records whenever such disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or otherwise be prohibited by law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Records available at the IMLS FOIA Electronic Reading Room.</E> IMLS makes records available on its website Reading Room in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), as amended, as well as other records that have been requested three or more times or that, because of the nature of their subject matter, are likely to be the subject of FOIA requests. IMLS establishes categories of records that can be disclosed regularly and proactively identifies and discloses additional records of interest to the public. To save time and money, and maximize efficiency, IMLS strongly urges individuals who seek information from IMLS to review documents available at the IMLS FOIA Electronic Reading Room before submitting a FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this part, IMLS adopts all of the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act, and the OMB Guidelines, unless otherwise defined in this part.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request.</E> A request by or on behalf of anyone who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct costs.</E> Those expenses that IMLS actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16.1 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> The making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Educational institution.</E> Any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category <PRTPAGE P="513"/>must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Fee waiver.</E> The waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">FOIA Public Liaison.</E> An IMLS official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of FOIA requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution.</E> An institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Representative of the news media.</E> Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. Agencies will advise requesters of their placement in this category.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Requester Category.</E> One of the three categories that IMLS places requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication, and include commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Review.</E> The examination of a record located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes all of the processing that is necessary to prepare any record for disclosure, including, as applicable, redacting portions of the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential business information submitter under § 1184.9 but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the applicability of exemptions.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Search.</E> The process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a FOIA request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from both hard copy and electronic records.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Working day.</E> A regular Federal work day constitutes a working day. It does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1184.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How do I request records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Where to send a request.</E> You may make a FOIA request for IMLS records by completing the online prompts in the FOIA Online Portal via FOIA.gov <PRTPAGE P="514"/>or via <E T="03">https://www.imls.gov/about/foia-request/form</E> or by sending an email to <E T="03">foia@imls.gov</E> or by submitting a request in writing via regular U.S. Mail addressed directly to the FOIA Public Liaison, Institute of Museum and Library Services, 955 L'Enfant Plaza North SW, Suite 4000, Washington, DC 20024-2135. Requests may also be sent in writing via facsimile to the FOIA Officer at (202) 653-4625.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of request.</E> Your FOIA request need not be in any particular format, but it must be in writing, include your name and mailing address, and should be clearly identified as a Freedom of Information Act or “FOIA” request. You must describe the records you seek with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to identify and locate the records, including, if possible, dates, subjects, titles, or authors of the records requested. Before submitting a request, you may contact IMLS's FOIA contact or FOIA Officer to discuss the records you seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If upon receiving your request IMLS determines that it does not reasonably describe the requested records, IMLS will advise you what additional information is required to perfect your request, or why your request is otherwise insufficient. You should also indicate if you have a preferred form or format in which you would like to receive the requested records.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Electronic format records.</E> IMLS will provide the responsive records in the form or format you request if the records are readily reproducible by IMLS in that form or format. IMLS will make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible for the purpose of disclosure. IMLS may disclose records in electronic format if the records can be downloaded or transferred intact through electronic media currently in use by the agency. In responding to a request for records, IMLS will make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except where such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system(s).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Date of receipt.</E> IMLS considers a request that complies with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to be a perfected request. The agency considers a request to be received on the date that the request is perfected.</P>
              <CITA>[79 FR 9423, Feb. 19, 2014, as amended at 84 FR 22946, May 21, 2019]</CITA>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1184.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>When will I receive a response to my request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Responses within 20 working days.</E> IMLS will ordinarily grant, partially grant, or deny your request for records within 20 working days after receiving a perfected request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Extensions of response time in “unusual circumstances”.</E> (1) Where the time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, the FOIA Officer will notify you as soon as practicable in writing of the unusual circumstances and may extend the response period for up to ten (10) working days.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the extension is for more than ten (10) working days, the FOIA Officer will provide you with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an agreed upon alternative time period for processing the request or a modified request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) IMLS must process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
              <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted as required by § 1184.6.</P>

              <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) <PRTPAGE P="515"/>of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, IMLS may waive the formal certification requirement.</P>
              <P>(4) IMLS must notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, IMLS must act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will my request be processed?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of requests.</E> IMLS will assign a tracking number to your request and will, as soon as practicable, advise you in writing of this tracking number, and, as appropriate, a brief description of the request, and relevant IMLS contact information, including the name and contact information of the FOIA Public Liaison.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Clarifications.</E> If there is any uncertainty, IMLS will attempt to communicate with you to clarify the scope of your request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.</E> Upon request, IMLS will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, IMLS may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Referrals of requests.</E> Whenever IMLS refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, IMLS will notify you of the name of the agency to which the request has been referred.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> When responsive records are located, IMLS will apply a presumption of disclosure and openness. If IMLS decides to grant your request in whole or in part, the agency will notify you in writing. The notice will include any applicable fee and the agency will disclose records to you promptly upon payment of applicable fees. IMLS will mark or annotate any records disclosed in part to show the amount, the location, and the FOIA exemptions under which the redaction is made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Denials of requests.</E> Denials of your FOIA request, either whole or in part, will be made in writing by the FOIA Public Liaison. IMLS will inform you of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the agency in denying the request, and notify you of your right to appeal the determination as described in § 1184.6. IMLS will, as appropriate, provide a brief description of the information being withheld. In addition, IMLS will provide information about the mediation services provided by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1184.6</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How can I appeal a denial of my request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Submission of an appeal.</E> If your FOIA request has been denied in whole or in part, or if the agency has not found any records in response to your request, you may file an appeal no later than ninety (90) calendar days following the date of the notification of denial. Your appeal must include a description of the initial request, the reason for the appeal, and why you believe the agency's response was incorrect. Your appeal must be in writing, signed, and filed with the IMLS Director, c/o <PRTPAGE P="516"/>Office of the General Counsel, 955 L'Enfant Plaza North SW, Suite 4000, Washington, DC 20024-2135. Appeals may also be sent via email to <E T="03">foia@imls.gov,</E> or via facsimile to (202) 653-4625.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions on appeal.</E> The Director of IMLS will make a determination with respect to your appeal within twenty (20) working days after the agency has received the appeal, except as provided in § 1184.4(b). If the decision on appeal is favorable to you, the Director of IMLS will take action to assure prompt dispatch of the records to you. If the decision on appeal is adverse to you, in whole or in part, you will be informed by the Director of IMLS of the reasons for the decision and of the provisions for judicial review set forth in the FOIA. As appropriate, IMLS will advise you in a response to an appeal that the 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will fees be charged?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> IMLS will use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with FOIA requests. IMLS will charge fees to recover all allowable direct costs incurred, and may charge fees for searching for and reviewing requested records even if the records are determined to be exempt from disclosure or cannot be located. IMLS will charge fees in accordance with the category of the FOIA requester.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requests.</E> IMLS will assess charges to recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing and duplicating the requested records. IMLS may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific institutions.</E> IMLS will charge for duplication costs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Requests by representatives of the news media.</E> IMLS will charge for duplication costs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requests.</E> IMLS will assess charges to recover the full direct cost for searching for and duplicating the requested records.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Status of Requester.</E> IMLS' decision regarding the categorization of a requester will be made on a case-by-case basis based upon the requester's intended use of the requested records.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General fee schedule.</E> The following fees will be charged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Manual search fee.</E> The fee charged will be the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the search.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer search fee.</E> The fee charged will be the actual direct cost of providing the service including the cost of operating the central processing unit for the operating time that is directly attributed to searching for records responsive to a request and the operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review fee.</E> The fee charged will equal the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Duplication fee.</E> Copies of records photocopied on an 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 inch sheet of paper will be provided at $.10 per page. For duplication of other materials, the charge will be the direct cost of duplication.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) Except for records provided in response to a commercial use request, the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two (2) hours of search time will be provided at no charge.</P>
              <P>(2) Fees will not be charged to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the total amount calculated under this section is less than $25.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees likely to exceed $25.</E> If the total fee charges are likely to exceed $25, IMLS will notify you of the estimated amount of the charges, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review and/or duplication, unless you have indicated in advance that you are willing to pay higher fees and will offer you an opportunity to confer with the FOIA Public Liaison to revise the request to meet your needs at a lower cost.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) IMLS will disclose records without charge or at a reduced charge if the <PRTPAGE P="517"/>agency determines that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
              <P>(2) IMLS will use the following factors to determine whether a fee will be waived or reduced:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">The subject of the request.</E> Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the “operations or activities of the government”;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">The informative value of the information to be disclosed.</E> Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure.</E> Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding”;</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">The significance of the contribution to public understanding.</E> Whether disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest.</E> Whether you have a commercial interest that would be furthered by the disclosure; and if so</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">The primary interest in disclosure.</E> Whether the magnitude of your commercial interest is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the your commercial interest.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Assessment and collection of fees.</E> (1) If you fail to pay your bill within thirty (30) days, interest will accrue from the date the bill was mailed, and will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
              <P>(2) If IMLS reasonably believes that you are attempting to divide a request into a series of requests to avoid the assessment of fees, the agency may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> (i) Advance payment of fees will generally not be required. IMLS may request an advance payment of the fee, however, if:</P>
              <P>(A) The charges are likely to exceed $250; or</P>
              <P>(B) You have failed previously to pay a fee in a timely fashion.</P>
              <P>(ii) When IMLS requests an advance payment, the time limits described in section (a)(6) of the FOIA will begin only after IMLS has received advanced full payment in full.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to comply.</E> In the absence of unusual or exceptional circumstances, IMLS will not assess fees if the agency fails to comply with any time limit set forth in this part, unless the agency has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Waivers.</E> IMLS may waive fees in other circumstances solely at its discretion, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1184.9</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are IMLS' policies regarding disclosure of confidential business information?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Confidential business information obtained by IMLS from a submitter will be disclosed under FOIA only under this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Confidential business information.</E> Commercial or financial information obtained by IMLS from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of FOIA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter.</E> Any person or entity from whom IMLS obtains confidential business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of confidential business information.</E> A submitter of confidential business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> When required under paragraph (e) of this section, subject to the exceptions in paragraph (h) of this section, IMLS will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its confidential business information, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information. The notice will either describe the confidential business information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Where notice is required.</E> IMLS will give notice to a submitter wherever:</P>
              <P>(1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
              <P>(2) IMLS has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> IMLS will allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section and will specify that time period within the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it must submit a detailed written statement to IMLS. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. If a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is not received by IMLS until after the agency's disclosure decision has been made will not be considered by IMLS. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> IMLS will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose confidential business information. If IMLS decides to disclose confidential business information over the objection of a submitter, IMLS will give the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the confidential business information to be disclosed; and</P>
              <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section will not apply if:</P>

              <P>(1) IMLS determines that the information should not be disclosed;<PRTPAGE P="519"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600; or</P>
              <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous—except that, in such a case, IMLS will, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> If a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential business information, IMLS will promptly notify the submitter of the filing of the lawsuit.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Corresponding notice to requesters.</E> If IMLS provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, IMLS will also notify the requester(s). If IMLS notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose requested information under paragraph (g) of this section, IMLS will also notify the requester(s). If a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of confidential business information, IMLS will notify the requester(s) of the filing of the lawsuit.</P>
