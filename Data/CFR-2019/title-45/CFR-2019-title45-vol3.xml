      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The State plan is a comprehensive statement submitted by the State agency describing the nature and scope of its program and giving assurance that it will be administered in conformity with the specific requirements stipulated in the pertinent title of the Act, the regulations in subtitle A and this chapter of this title, and other applicable official issuances of the Department. The State plan contains all information necessary for the Administration to determine whether the plan can be approved, as a basis for Federal financial participation in the State program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Approval of State plans and amendments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The State plan consists of written documents furnished by the State to cover each of its programs under the Act: Old-age assistance (title I); aid and services to needy families with children (part A of title IV); aid to the blind (title X); aid to the permanently and totally disabled (title XIV); or aid to the aged, blind or disabled (title XVI). The State may submit the common material on more than one program as an integrated plan. However, it must identify the provisions pertinent to each title since a separate plan must be approved for each public assistance title. A plan submitted under title XVI encompasses, under a single plan, the programs otherwise covered by three separate plans under titles I, X, and XIV. After approval of the original plan by the Administration, all relevant changes, required by new statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions, are required to be submitted currently so that the Administration may determine whether the plan continues to meet Federal requirements and policies.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Submittal.</E> State plans and revisions of the plans are submitted first to the State governor or his designee for review in accordance with § 204.1 of this chapter, and then to the regional office. The States are encouraged to obtain consultation of the regional staff when a plan is in process of preparation or revision.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review.</E> Staff in the regional offices are responsible for review of State plans and amendments. They also initiate discussion with the State agency on clarification of significant aspects of the plan which come to their attention in the course of this review. State plan material on which the regional staff has questions concerning the application of Federal policy is referred with recommendations as required to the central office for technical assistance. Comments and suggestions, including those of consultants in specified areas, may be prepared by the central office for use by the regional staff in negotiations with the State agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Action.</E> The Regional Administrator, exercised delegated authority to take affirmative action on State plans and amendments thereto on the basis of policy statements or precedents previously approved by the Administrator. The Administrator retains authority for determining that proposed plan material is not approvable, or that a previously approved plan no longer meets the requirements for approval, except that a final determination of disapproval may not be made without prior consultation and discussion by the Administrator with the Secretary. The Regional Administrator, or the Administrator formally notifies the State agency of the actions taken on State plans or revisions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Basis for approval.</E> Determinations as to whether State plans (including plan amendments and administrative practice under the plans) originally meet or continue to meet, the requirements for approval are based on relevant Federal statutes and regulations. Guidelines are furnished to assist in the interpretation of the regulations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Prompt approval of State plans.</E> Pursuant to section 1116 of the Act, the determination as to whether a State plan submitted for approval conforms to the requirements for approval under the Act and regulations issued pursuant thereto shall be made promptly and not later than the 90th day following the date on which the plan submittal is received in the regional office, unless the Regional Administrator, has secured from the State agency a written agreement to extend that period.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Prompt approval of plan amendments.</E> Any amendment of an approved State plan may, at the option of the State, be considered as a submission of a new State plan. If the State requests that such amendment be so considered the determination as to its conformity with the requirements for approval shall be made promptly and not later than the 90th day following the date on which such a request is received in the regional office with respect to an amendment that has been received in such office, unless the Regional Administrator, has secured from the State agency a written agreement to extend that period. In absence of request by a State that an amendment of an approved State plan shall be considered as a submission of a new State plan, <PRTPAGE P="9"/>the procedures under § 201.6 (a) and (b) shall be applicable.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The effective date of a new plan may not be earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter in which an approvable plan is submitted, and with respect to expenditures for assistance under such plan, may not be earlier than the first day on which the plan is in operation on a statewide basis. The same applies with respect to plan amendments that provide additional assistance or services to persons eligible under the approved plan or that make new groups eligible for assistance or services provided under the approved plan. For other plan amendments the effective date shall be as specified in other sections of this chapter.</P>

              <P>Pursuant to section 1116 of the Act, any State dissatisfied with a determination of the Administrator pursuant to § 201.3 (e) or (f) with respect to any plan or amendment may, within 60 days after the date of receipt of notification of such determination, file a petition with the Regional Administrator, asking the Administrator for reconsideration of the issue of whether such plan or amendment conforms to the requirements for approval under the Act and pertinent Federal requirements. Within 30 days after receipt of such a petition, the Administrator shall notify the State of the time and place at which the hearing for the purpose of reconsidering such issue will be held. Such hearing shall be held not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date notice of such hearing is furnished to the State, unless the Administrator and the State agree in writing on another time. For hearing procedures, see part 213 of this chapter. A determination affirming, modifying, or reversing the Administrator's original decision will be made within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing. Action pursuant to an initial determination by the Administrator described in such § 201.3 (e) or (f) that a plan or amendment is not approvable shall not be stayed pending the reconsideration, but in the event that the Administrator subsequently determines that his original decision was incorrect he shall certify restitution forthwith in a lump sum of any funds incorrectly withheld or otherwise denied.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Grants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>To States with approved plans, grants are made each quarter for expenditures under the plan for assistance, services, training and administration. The determination as to the amount of a grant to be made to a State is based upon documents submitted by the State agency containing information required under the Act and such other pertinent facts, including title IV-A the appropriate Federal share of child support collections made by the State, as may be found necessary.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Form and manner of submittal.</E> (1) Time and place: The estimates for public assistance grants for each quarterly period must be forwarded to the regional office 45 days prior to the period of the estimate. They include a certification of State funds available and a justification statement in support of the estimates. A statement of quarterly expenditures and any necessary supporting schedules must be forwarded to the Department of Health and Human Services, Family Support Administration, not later than 30 days after the end of the quarter.</P>

              <P>(2) Description of forms: “State Agency Expenditure Projection—Quarterly Projection by Program” represents the State agency's estimate of the total amount and the Federal share of expenditures for assistance, services, training, and administration to be made during the quarter for each of the public assistance programs under the Act. From these estimates the State and Federal shares of the total expenditures are computed. The State's computed share of total estimated expenditures is the amount of State and local funds necessary for the quarter. The Federal share is the basis for the funds to be advanced for the quarter. The <PRTPAGE P="10"/>State agency must also certify, on this form or otherwise, the amount of State funds (exclusive of any balance of advances received from the Federal Government) actually on hand and available for expenditure; this certification must be signed by the executive officer of the State agency submitting the estimate or a person officially designated by him, or by a fiscal officer of the State if required by State law or regulation. (A form “Certificate of Availability of State Funds for Assistance and Administration during Quarter” is available for submitting this information, but its use is optional.) If the amount of State funds (or State and local funds if localities participate in the program), shown as available for expenditures is not sufficient to cover the State's proportionate share of the amount estimated to be expended, the certification must contain a statement showing the source from which the amount of the deficiency is expected to be derived and the time when this amount is expected to be made available.</P>
              <P>(3) The State agency must also submit a quarterly statement of expenditures for each of the public assistance programs under the Act. This is an accounting statement of the disposition of the Federal funds granted for past periods and provides the basis for making the adjustments necessary when the State's estimate for any prior quarter was greater or less than the amount the State actually expended in that quarter. The statement of expenditures also shows the share of the Federal Government in any recoupment, from whatever source, including for title IV-A the appropriate share of child support collections made by the State, of expenditures claimed in a prior period, and also in expenditures not properly subject to Federal financial participation which are acknowledged by the State agency, including the share of the Federal Government for uncashed and cancelled checks as described at 45 CFR 201.67 and replacement checks as described at 45 CFR 201.70 in this part, or which have been revealed in the course of an audit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review.</E> The State's estimates are analyzed by the regional office staff and are forwarded with recommendations as required to the central office. The central office reviews the State's estimate, other relevant information, and any adjustments to be made for prior periods, and computes the grant.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grant award.</E> The grant award computation form shows, by program, the amount of the estimate for the ensuing quarter, and the amounts by which the estimate is reduced or increased because of over- or under-estimate for the prior quarter and for other adjustments. This form is transmitted to the State agency to draw the amount of the grant award, as needed, to meet the Federal share of disbursements. The draw is through a commercial bank and the Federal Reserve system against a continuing letter of credit certified to the Secretary of the Treasury in favor of the State payee. A copy of the grant award notice is sent to the State Central Information Reception Agency in accord with section 201 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Letter of credit payment system.</E> The letter of credit system for payment of advances of Federal funds was established pursuant to Treasury Department regulations (Circular No. 1075), published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on July 11, 1967 (32 FR 10201). The HEW “Instructions to Recipient Organizations for Use of Letter of Credit” was transmitted to all grantees by memorandum from the Assistant Secretary-Comptroller on January 15, 1968.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">General administrative requirements.</E> With the following exceptions, the provisions of part 74 of this title, establishing uniform administrative requirements and cost principles, shall apply to all grants made to States under this part:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholding of payment; reduction of Federal financial participation in the costs of social services and training.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">When withheld.</E> Further payments to a State are withheld in whole or in part if the Administrator, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency administering or supervising the administration of an approved plan, finds:</P>
              <P>(1) That the plan no longer complies with the provisions of section 2, 402, 1002, 1402, or 1602 of the Act; or</P>
              <P>(2) That in the administration of the plan there is failure to comply substantially with any such provision.</P>
              <P>A question of noncompliance of a State plan may arise from an unapprovable change in the approved State plan, the failure of the State to change its approved plan to conform to a new Federal requirement for approval of State plans, or the failure of the State in practice to comply with a Federal requirement, whether or not its State plan has been amended to conform to such requirement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When the rate of Federal financial participation is reduced.</E> Under title I, X, XIV, or XVI (AABD) of the Act, Federal financial participation in the costs of social services and training approved at the rate of 75 per centum is reduced to 50 per centum if the Administrator, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to the State agency, finds:</P>
              <P>(1) That the plan provision under such title for prescribed services no longer complies with the Federal requirements with respect to such prescribed services; or</P>
              <P>(2) That in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially with such plan provision.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Information discussions.</E> Hearings with respect to matters under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are generally not called, however, until after reasonable effort has been made by the Administration to resolve the questions involved by conference and discussion with State officials. Formal notification of the date and place of hearing does not foreclose further negotiations with State officials.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conduct of hearings.</E> For hearing procedures, see part 213 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of withholding.</E> If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance with respect to a matter under paragraph (a) of this section, the State agency is notified that further payments will not be made to the State (or, in his discretion, that payments will be limited to categories under or parts of the plan not affected by such failure), until the Administrator is satisfied that there will no longer be any such failure to comply. Until he is so satisfied, no further payments will be made to the State (or will be limited to categories under or parts of the plan not affected by such failure).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification of reduction in the rate of Federal financial participation.</E> If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance with respect to a matter under paragraph (b) of this section, the State agency is notified that further payments will be made to the State at the rate of 50 per centum of the costs of services and training, until the Administrator is satisfied that there will no longer be any failure to comply.</P>

              <P>Any State dissatisfied with a final determination of the Secretary pursuant to § 201.4 or § 201.6(a) may, within 60 days after it has been notified of such determination, file with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of such determination. After a copy of the petition is transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary, the Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of proceedings upon which such determination was based as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. The court is bound by the Secretary's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence. The court has jurisdiction to affirm the Secretary's decision, or set it aside in whole or in part, or, for good cause, to remand the case for additional evidence. If the case is remanded, the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact, and may modify his previous determination. The Secretary shall certify to the court the transcript and record of the further <PRTPAGE P="12"/>proceedings. The judgment of the court is subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1254.</P>

              <P>(a) In order to provide a basis for determining that State agencies are adhering to Federal requirements and to the substantive legal and administrative provisions of their approved plans, the Administration conducts a review of State and local public assistance administration. This review includes analysis of procedures and policies of State and local agencies and examination of case records of individual recipients.</P>
              <P>(b) Each State agency is required to carry out a continuing quality control program primarily covering determination of eligibility in statistically selected samples of individual cases. The Service conducts a continuing observation of these State systems.</P>
              <P>(c) Adherence to other Federal requirements set forth in the pertinent titles of the Act and the regulations in this title is evaluated through review of selected case records and aspects of agency operations.</P>

              <P>A personnel merit system review is carried out by the Office of State Merit Systems of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration of the Department. The purpose of the review is to evaluate the effectiveness of the State merit system relating to the public assistance programs and to determine whether there is compliance with Federal requirements in the administration of the merit system plan. See part 70 of this title.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Public assistance audits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Annually, or at such frequencies as are considered necessary and appropriate, the operations of the State agency are audited by representatives of the Audit Agency of the Department. Such audits are made to determine whether the State agency is being operated in a manner that:</P>
              <P>(1) Encourages prudent use of program funds, and</P>
              <P>(2) Provides a reasonable degree of assurance that funds are being properly expended, and for the purposes for which appropriated and provided for under the related Act and State plan, including State laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) Reports of these audits are released by the Audit Agency simultaneously to program officials of the Department, and to the cognizant State officials. These audit reports relate the opinion of the Audit Agency on the practices reviewed and the allowability of costs audited at the State agency. Final determinations as to actions required on all matters reported are made by cognizant officials of the Department.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Action on audit and review findings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the audit results in no exceptions, the State agency is advised by letter of this result. The general course for the disposition of proposed exceptions resulting from audits involves the submittal of details of these exceptions to the State agency which then has an opportunity to concur in the proposed exceptions or to assemble and submit additional facts for purposes of clearance. Provision is made for the State agency to appeal proposed audit exceptions in which it has not concurred and which have not been deleted on the basis of clearance material. After consideration of a State agency's appeal by the Administrator, the Administration advises the State agency of any expenditures in which the Federal Government may not participate and requests it to include the amount as adjustments in a subsequent statement of expenditures. Expenditures in which it is found the Federal Government may not participate and which are not properly adjusted through the State's claim will be deducted from subsequent grants made to the State agency.</P>

              <P>(b) If the Federal or State reviews reveal serious problems with respect to compliance with any Federal requirement, the State agency is required to <PRTPAGE P="13"/>correct its practice so that there will be no recurrence of the problem in the future.</P>

              <FP>If the State chooses to repay amounts representing higher percentages during the early quarters, any corresponding reduction in required minimum percentages would be applied first to the last scheduled payment, then to the next to the last payment, and so forth as necessary.</FP>
              <P>(2) The latest State Agency Statement of Financial Plan for AFDC submitted by the State shall be used to estimate the State's share of annual expenditures for the specific program in which the unallowable expenditures occurred. That estimated share shall be the sum of the State's share of the estimates (as shown on the latest State Agency Statement of Financial Plan for AFDC) for four quarters, beginning with the quarter in which the first installment is to be paid.</P>

              <P>(3) In the case of a program terminated by law or by the State, the actual State share—rather than the estimate—shall be used for determining whether the amount of the repayment exceeds 2<FR>1/2</FR>% of the annual State share for the program. The annual State <PRTPAGE P="17"/>share in these cases will be determined using payments computable for Federal funding as reported for the program by the State on its Quarterly Statement of Expenditures reports submitted for the last four quarters preceding the date on which the program was terminated.</P>
              <P>(4) Repayment shall be accomplished through adjustment in the quarterly grants over the period covered by the repayment schedule.</P>
              <P>(5) The amount of the repayment for purpose of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may not include any amount previously approved for installment repayment.</P>
              <P>(6) The repayment schedule may be extended beyond 12 quarterly installments if the total repayment amount exceeds 100% of the estimated State share of annual expenditures. In these circumstances, the criteria in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) or (3) of this section, as appropriate, shall be followed for repayment of the amount equal to 100% of the annual State share. The remaining amount of the repayment shall be in quarterly amounts not less than those for the 9th through 12th quarters.</P>
              <P>(7) The amount of a retroactive claim to be paid a State will be offset against any amounts to be, or already being, repaid by the State in installments, under the same title of the Social Security Act. Under this provision the State may choose to:</P>
              <P>(i) Suspend payments until the retroactive claim due the State has, in fact, been offset; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Continue payments until the reduced amount of its debt (remaining after the offset), has been paid in full. This second option would result in a shorter payment period. A retroactive claim for the purpose of this regulation is a claim applicable to any period ending 12 months or more prior to the beginning of the quarter in which the payment is to be made by the Administration.</P>

This section is also applicable to determinations with respect to grants which were made under authority which has expired or been repealed since the grants were made, even though such authority does not appear in the appendix.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission.</E> (1) A grantee who has received notification, as described in § 16.3 (b) and (c) of this title, of a determination described in part 16, appendix A, section C of this title, may request reconsideration by informing the Grants Appeals Officer as identified in the final adverse determination or otherwise designated by the Administrator, Family Support Administration, Washington, DC 20201 of the grantee's intent to contest the determination. The grantee's request for reconsideration must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the postmark date of the written notification of such determination, except when the Grant Appeals Officer grants an extension of time for good cause.</P>
            <P>(2) Although the request need not follow any prescribed form, it shall clearly identify the question or questions in dispute and contain a full statement of the grantee's position with respect to such question or questions, and the pertinent facts and reasons in support of such position. The grantee shall attach to his submission a copy of the agency notification specified in § 16.3(b) of this title.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Action by the Administration on requests for reconsideration.</E> (1) Upon receipt of such an application the Grant Appeals Officer will inform the grantee that:</P>

            <P>(2) Hearing procedures shall be issued and publicized by the State agency. Such procedures shall provide for a face-to-face hearing or, at State option, a hearing by telephone when the applicant or recipient also agrees. Under this provision, the State shall assure that the applicant or recipient is afforded all rights as specified in this section, whether the hearing is face-to-face or by telephone;</P>
            <P>(3) Every applicant or recipient shall be informed in writing at the time of application and at the time of any action affecting his claim:</P>
            <P>(i) Of his right to a hearing, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) Of the method by which he may obtain a hearing;</P>
            <P>(iii) That he may be represented by an authorized representative, such as legal counsel, relative, friend, or other spokesman, or he may represent himself.</P>

            <P>(4) In cases of intended action to discontinue, terminate, suspend or reduce assistance or to change the manner or form of payment to a protective, vendor, or two-party payment under § 234.60:<PRTPAGE P="21"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The State or local agency shall give timely and adequate notice, except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(4) (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section. Under this requirement:</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Timely</E> means that the notice is mailed at least 10 days before the date of action, that is, the date upon which the action would become effective;</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Adequate</E> means a written notice that includes a statement of what action the agency intends to take, the reasons for the intended agency action, the specific regulations supporting such action, explanation of the individual's right to request an evidentiary hearing (if provided) and a State agency hearing, the circumstances under which assistance is continued if a hearing is requested, and if the agency action is upheld, that such assistance must be repaid under title IV-A, and must also be repaid under titles I, X, XIV or XVI (AABD) if the State plan provides for recovery of such payments.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency may dispense with timely notice but shall send adequate notice not later than the date of action when:</P>
            <P>(A) The agency has factual information confirming the death of a recipient or of the AFDC payee when there is no relative available to serve as new payee;</P>
            <P>(B) The agency receives a clear written statement signed by a recipient that he no longer wishes assistance, or that gives information which requires termination or reduction of assistance, and the recipient has indicated, in writing, that he understands that this must be the consequence of supplying such information;</P>
            <P>(C) The recipient has been admitted or committed to an institution, and further payments to that individual do not qualify for Federal financial participation under the State plan;</P>
            <P>(D) The recipient has been placed in skilled nursing care, intermediate care or long-term hospitalization;</P>
            <P>(E) The claimant's whereabouts are unknown and agency mail directed to him has been returned by the post office indicating no known forwarding address. The claimant's check must, however, be made available to him if his whereabouts become known during the payment period covered by a returned check;</P>
            <P>(F) A recipient has been accepted for assistance in a new jurisdiction and that fact has been established by the jurisdiction previously providing assistance;</P>
            <P>(G) An AFDC child is removed from the home as a result of a judicial determination, or voluntarily placed in foster care by his legal guardian;</P>
            <P>(H) For AFDC, the agency takes action because of information the recipient furnished in a monthly report or because the recipient has failed to submit a complete or a timely monthly report without good cause. (See § 233.37);</P>
            <P>(I) A special allowance granted for a specific period is terminated and the recipient has been informed in writing at the time of initiation that the allowance shall automatically terminate at the end of the specified period;</P>
            <P>(J) The agency has made a presumption of mismanagement as a result of a recipient's nonpayment of rent and provides for post hearings in such circumstances;</P>
            <P>(K) An individual's payment is suspended or reduced for failure to meet a payment after performance obligation as set forth at § 233.101(b)(2)(iv) (B) or (C) of this chapter. In addition to the contents set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the adequate notice must advise the individual of the right to have assistance immediately reinstated retroactive to the date of action at the previous month's level pending the hearing decision if he or she makes a request for a hearing and reinstatement within 10 days after the date of the notice.</P>
            <P>(iii) When changes in either State or Federal law require automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients, timely notice of such grant adjustments shall be given which shall be “adequate” if it includes a statement of the intended action, the reasons for such intended action, a statement of the specific change in law requiring such action and a statement of the circumstances under which a hearing may be obtained and assistance continued.</P>

            <P>(iv) When the agency obtains facts indicating that assistance should be discontinued, suspended, terminated, or reduced because of the probable <PRTPAGE P="22"/>fraud of the recipient, and, where possible, such facts have been verified through collateral sources, notice of such grant adjustment shall be timely if mailed at least five (5) days before action would become effective.</P>
            <P>(5) An opportunity for a hearing shall be granted to any applicant who requests a hearing because his or her claim for financial assistance (including a request for supplemental payments under §§ 233.23 and 233.27) is denied, or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness, and to any recipient who is aggrieved by any agency action resulting in suspension, reduction, discontinuance, or termination of assistance, or determination that a protective, vendor, or two-party payment should be made or continued. A hearing need not be granted when either State or Federal law requires automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is incorrect grant computation.</P>
            <P>(i) A request for a hearing is defined as a clear expression by the claimant (or his authorized representative acting for him), to the effect that he wants the opportunity to present his case to higher authority. The State may require that such request be in written form in order to be effective;</P>
            <P>(ii) The freedom to make such a request shall not be limited or interfered with in any way. The agency may assist the claimant to submit and process his request;</P>
            <P>(iii) The claimant shall be provided reasonable time, not to exceed 90 days, in which to appeal an agency action;</P>
            <P>(iv) Agencies may respond to a series of individual requests for hearing by conducting a single group hearing. Agencies may consolidate only cases in which the sole issue involved is one of State or Federal law or policy or changes in State or Federal law. In all group hearings, the policies governing hearings must be followed. Thus, each individual claimant shall be permitted to present his own case or be represented by his authorized representative;</P>
            <P>(v) The agency may deny or dismiss a request for a hearing where it has been withdrawn by the claimant in writing, where the sole issue is one of State or Federal law requiring automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients, where a decision has been rendered after a WIN hearing before the manpower agency that a participant has, without good cause, refused to accept employment or participate in the WIN program, or has failed to request such a hearing after notice of intended action for such refusal, or where it is abandoned. Abandonment may be deemed to have occurred if the claimant, without good cause therefor, fails to appear by himself or by authorized representative at the hearing scheduled for such claimant.</P>
            <P>(6) If the recipient requests a hearing within the timely notice period:</P>
            <P>(i) Assistance shall not be suspended, reduced, discontinued or terminated (but is subject to recovery by the agency if its action is sustained), until a decision is rendered after a hearing, unless:</P>
            <P>(A) A determination is made at the hearing that the sole issue is one of State or Federal law or policy, or change in State or Federal law and not one of incorrect grant computation;</P>
            <P>(B) A change affecting the recipient's grant occurs while the hearing decision is pending and the recipient fails to request a hearing after notice of the change;</P>
            <P>(C) The recipient specifically requests that he or she not receive continued assistance pending a hearing decision; or</P>
            <P>(D) The agency has made a presumption of mismanagement as a result of a recipient's nonpayment of rent and provides for the opportunity for a hearing after the manner or form of payment has been changed for such cases in accordance with § 234.60 (a)(2) and (a)(11).</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency shall promptly inform the claimant in writing if assistance is to be discontinued pending the hearing decision; and</P>

            <P>(iii) In any case where the decision of an evidentiary hearing is adverse to the claimant, he shall be informed of and afforded the right to make a written request, within 15 days of the mailing of the notification of such adverse decision, for a State agency hearing and of his right to request a de novo hearing. Unless a de novo hearing is specifically requested by the appellant, <PRTPAGE P="23"/>the State agency hearing may consist of a review by the State agency hearing officer of the record of the evidentiary hearing to determine whether the decision of the evidentiary hearing officer was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Assistance shall not be continued after an adverse decision to the claimant at the evidentiary hearing.</P>
            <P>(7) A State may provide that a hearing request made after the date of action (but during a period not in excess of 10 days following such date) shall result in reinstatement of assistance to be continued until the hearing decision, unless (i) the recipient specifically requests that continued assistance not be paid pending the hearing decision; or (ii) at the hearing it is determined that the sole issue is one of State or Federal law or policy. In any case where action was taken without timely notice, if the recipient requests a hearing within 10 days of the mailing of the notice of the action, and the agency determines that the action resulted from other than the application of State or Federal law or policy or a change in State or Federal law, assistance shall be reinstated and continued until a decision is rendered after the hearing, unless the recipient specifically requests that continued assistance not be paid pending the hearing decision.</P>
            <P>(8) The hearing shall be conducted at a reasonable time, date, and place, and adequate preliminary written notice shall be given.</P>
            <P>(9) Hearings shall be conducted by an impartial official (officials) or designee of the agency. Under this requirement, the hearing official (officials) or designee shall not have been directly involved in the initial determination of the action in question.</P>
            <P>(10) When the hearing involves medical issues such as those concerning a diagnosis, an examining physician's report, or a medical review team's decision, a medical assessment other than that of the person or persons involved in making the original decision shall be obtained at agency expense and made part of the record if the hearing officer considers it necessary.</P>
            <P>(11) In respect to title IV-C, when the appeal has been taken on the basis of a disputed WIN registration requirement, exemption determination or finding of failure to appear for an appraisal interview, a representative of the local WIN manpower agency shall, where appropriate, participate in the conduct of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(12) The hearing shall include consideration of:</P>
            <P>(i) An agency action, or failure to act with reasonable promptness, on a claim for financial assistance, which includes undue delay in reaching a decision on eligibility or in making a payment, refusal to consider a request for or undue delay in making an adjustment in payment, and discontinuance, termination or reduction of such assistance;</P>
            <P>(ii) Agency decision regarding:</P>
            <P>(A) Eligibility for financial assistance in both initial and subsequent determinations,</P>
            <P>(B) Amount of financial assistance or change in payments,</P>
            <P>(C) The manner or form of payment, including restricted or protective payments, even though no Federal financial participation is claimed.</P>
            <P>(13) The claimant, or his representative, shall have adequate opportunity:</P>
            <P>(i) To examine the contents of his case file and all documents and records to be used by the agency at the hearing at a reasonable time before the date of the hearing as well as during the hearing;</P>
            <P>(ii) At his option, to present his case himself or with the aid of an authorized representative;</P>
            <P>(iii) To bring witnesses;</P>
            <P>(iv) To establish all pertinent facts and circumstances;</P>
            <P>(v) To advance any arguments without undue interference;</P>
            <P>(vi) To question or refute any testimony or evidence, including opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.</P>

            <P>(14) Recommendations or decisions of the hearing officer or panel shall be based exclusively on evidence and other material introduced at the hearing. The transcript or recording of testimony and exhibits, or an official report containing the substance of what transpired at the hearing, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, and the recommendation or decision of the hearing officer or <PRTPAGE P="24"/>panel shall constitute the exclusive record and shall be available to the claimant at a place accessible to him or his representative at a reasonable time.</P>
            <P>(15) Decisions by the hearing authority shall:</P>
            <P>(i) In the event of an evidentiary hearing, consist of a memorandum decision summarizing the facts and identifying the regulations supporting the decision;</P>
            <P>(ii) In the event of a State agency de novo hearing, specify the reasons for the decision and identify the supporting evidence and regulations.</P>
            <FP>Under this requirement no persons who participated in the local decision being appealed shall participate in a final administrative decision on such a case.</FP>
            <P>(16) Prompt, definitive, and final administrative action shall be taken within 90 days from the date of the request for a hearing.</P>
            <P>(17) The claimant shall be notified of the decision in writing and, to the extent it is available to him, of his right to appeal to State agency hearing or judicial review.</P>
            <P>(18) When the hearing decision is favorable to the claimant, or when the agency decides in favor of the claimant prior to the hearing, the agency shall promptly make corrective payments retroactively to the date the incorrect action was taken.</P>
            <P>(19) All State agency hearing decisions shall be accessible to the public (subject to provisions of safeguarding public assistance information).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal financial participation.</E> Federal financial participation is available for the following items:</P>

            <P>(2) Payments of assistance made to carry out hearing decisions, or to take corrective action after an appeal but prior to hearing, or to extend the benefit of a hearing decision or court order to others in the same situation as those directly affected by the decision or order. Such payments may be retroactive in accordance with applicable Federal policies on corrective payments.</P>
            <P>(3) Payments of assistance within the scope of Federally aided public assistance programs made in accordance with a court order.</P>
            <P>(4) Administrative costs incurred by the agency for:</P>

            <P>(a) Effective July 1, 1981 through March 31, 1994, FFP is available at 90 percent of expenditures incurred for planning, design, development or installation of a statewide automated application processing and information retrieval system which are consistent with an approved ADP. (Beginning April 1, 1994 the match rate available for development of title IV-A automated systems is 50 percent.) The 90 percent FFP includes the purchase or rental of computer equipment and software directly required for and used in the operation of this system.</P>
            <P>(b) ACF will approve the system provided the following conditions are met—</P>
            <P>(1) ACF determines that the system is likely to provide more efficient, economical, and effective administration of the AFDC program.</P>
            <P>(2) The system is compatible with the claims processing and information retrieval systems used in the administration of State plans approved under title XIX, and State programs where there is FFP under title XX.</P>
            <P>(3) The system meets the requirements referred to in § 205.36.</P>

            <P>(4) The system meets criteria established in the title IV-A (AFDC) Automated Application Processing and Information Retrieval System Guide <PRTPAGE P="28"/>issued by ACF and which provides specific standard requirements for major functions, such as automated eligibility determination, grant computation, verification, referral, management control, compability, and data security.</P>
            <P>(5) The State agency certifies that—</P>
            <P>(i) The State will have all ownership rights in software or modifications thereof and associated documentation designed or developed with 90 percent FFP under this section, except that the Department of Health and Human Services reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use for Federal government purposes, such software, modifications, and documentation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Methods and procedures for properly charging the cost of all systems whether acquired from public or private sources shall be in accordance with Federal regulations in part 74 of this title and the applicable ACF title IV-A (AFDC) Automated Application Processing and Information Retrieval System Guide;</P>
            <P>(iii) The complete system planned, designed, developed, installed, and hardware acquired, with FFP under these regulations will be used for a period of time which is consistent with the advance planning document as approved, or which ACF determines is sufficient to justify the Federal funds invested;</P>
            <P>(iv) Information in the system will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Federal law; and</P>
            <P>(v) Access to the system in all of its aspects, including design, development, and operation, including work performed by any source, and including cost records of contractors and subcontractors, shall be made available to the Federal Government by the State at intervals deemed necessary by ACF to determine whether the conditions for approval are being met and to determine its efficiency, economy and effectiveness.</P>
            <P>(c) If ACF suspends approval, as described in § 205.37, of the advance automated data processing planning document and/or system, FFP at the higher matching rate shall not be allowed for any costs incurred, until such time as the conditions for approval are met. Should the State fail to correct the deficiencies which led to the suspension within 90 days of the date of notification of suspension or within a longer period of time agreed to by both the State and ACF, all Federal incentive funds invested to date that exceed the normal administrative FFP rate (50 percent) will be disallowed.</P>
            <P>(d) Should a State voluntarily withdraw its approved APD and cease development of the approved system, all Federal incentive funds invested to date that exceed the normal administrative FFP rate (50 percent) will be disallowed.</P>
            <P>(e) Once a State is certified as having met the requirements referred to in § 205.36 incentive funding will not be allowable for enhancements or other modifications unless these modifications are authorized by the Administation for Children and Families as a result of Federal legislative or regulatory change.</P>

            <P>(a) The State agency will use the information obtained under § 205.55, in conjunction with other information, for:</P>
            <P>(1) Determining individuals' eligibility for assistance under the State plan and determining the amount of assistance. States wishing to exclude categories of information items from follow-up must submit for the Secretary's approval a follow-up plan describing the categories of information items which it proposes to exclude. For each category, the State must provide a reasonable justification that follow-up is not cost-effective. A formal cost-benefit analysis is not required. A State may exclude information items from the following data sources without written justification if followed up previously from another source: Unemployment compensation information received from the Internal Revenue Service, and earnings information received from the Social Security Administration. Information items in these categories which are not duplicative, but provide new leads, may not be excluded without written justification. A State may submit a follow-up plan or alter its plan at any time by notifying the Secretary and submitting the necessary justification. The Secretary will approve or disapprove categories of information items to be excluded under the plan within 60 days of its submission. Those categories approved by the Secretary will constitute an approved State follow-up plan for IEVS. For those information items not excluded from follow-up,</P>
            <P>(i) The State agency shall review and compare the information obtained from each data exchange against information contained in the case record to determine whether it affects the applicant's or the recipient's eligibility or the amount of assistance.</P>
            <P>(ii) The State agency shall verify that the information is accurate and applicable to case circumstances either through the applicant or recipient or through a third party, if such verification is determined appropriate based on agency experience or is required under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

            <P>(iii) For applicants, if the information is received during the application <PRTPAGE P="35"/>period, the State agency shall use such information, to the extent possible, in making the eligibility determination.</P>
            <P>(iv) For individuals who are recipients when the information is received or for whom a decision could not be made prior to authorization of benefits, the State agency shall within forty-five (45) days of its receipt, initiate a notice of case action or an entry in the case record that no case action is necessary, except that: Completion of action may be delayed beyond forty-five (45) days on no more than twenty (20) percent of the information items targeted for follow-up, if:</P>
            <P>(A) The reason that the action cannot be completed within forty-five (45) days is the nonreceipt of requested third-party verification; and</P>
            <P>(B) Action is completed promptly, when third party verification is received or at the next time eligibility is redetermined, whichever is earlier. If action is completed when eligibility is redetermined and third party verification has not been received, the State agency shall make its decision based on information provided by the recipient and any other information in its possession.</P>
            <P>(v) The State agency shall use appropriate procedures to monitor the timeliness requirements specified in this subparagraph;</P>

            <P>(3) Criminal or civil prosecutions based on receipt of assistance under the State plan to which recipients were not entitled.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) State agencies shall not take any adverse action to terminate, deny, suspend or reduce benefits to an applicant or recipient, based on information produced by a Federal computer matching program that is subject to the requirements in the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act (CMPPA) unless (i) The information has been independently verified in accordance with the independent verification requirements set out in the State agency's written agreement as required by § 205.58 or (ii) The independent verification requirement has been waived by the Department's Data Integrity Board.</P>
            <P>(2) The CMPPA defines a matching program as any computerized comparison of (i) Two or more automated systems of records or a system of records with non-Federal records for the purpose of (A) Establishing or verifying the eligibility of, or continuing compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements by, applicants for, recipients or beneficiaries of, participants in, or providers of services with respect to, cash or in-kind assistance or payments under Federal benefit programs, or (B) Recouping payments or delinquent debts under such Federal benefit programs, or (ii) Two or more automated Federal personnel or payroll system of records or a system of Federal personnel or payroll record with non-Federal records.</P>
            <P>(c) If the agency intends to reduce, suspend, terminate or deny benefits as a result of the actions taken pursuant to this section, the agency must provide notice and the opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with § 205.10(a).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application, determination of eligibility and furnishing of assistance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">State plan requirements.</E> A State plan under title I, IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI(AABD), of that Social Security Act shall provide that:</P>
            <P>(1) Each individual wishing to do so shall have the opportunity to apply for assistance under the plan without delay. Under this requirement:</P>
            <P>(i) Each individual may apply under whichever of the State plan plans he chooses;</P>

            <P>(ii) The agency shall require a written application, signed under a penalty of perjury, on a form prescribed by the State agency, from the applicant himself, or his authorized representative, or, where the applicant is incompetent or incapacitated, someone acting responsibly for him. When an individual is required to be included in an existing assistance unit pursuant to paragraph <PRTPAGE P="40"/>(a)(1)(vii), such individual will be considered to be included in the application, as of the date he is required to be included in the assistance unit;</P>
            <P>(iii) An applicant may be assisted, if he so desires, by an individual(s) of his choice (who need not be a lawyer) in the various aspects of the application process and the redetermination of eligibility and may be accompanied by such individual(s) in contacts with the agency and when so accompanied may also be represented by them.</P>
            <P>(iv)-(v) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(vi) Every recipient in a State which provides a supplemental payment under § 233.27 of this chapter shall have an opportunity to request that payment without delay.</P>
            <P>(vii) For AFDC only, in order for the family to be eligible, an application with respect to a dependent child must also include, if living in the same household and otherwise eligible for assistance:</P>
            <P>(A) Any natural or adoptive parent, or stepparent (in the case of States with laws of general applicability); and</P>
            <P>(B) Any blood-related or adoptive brother or sister; <E T="03">Exception:</E> needs and income of disqualified alien siblings, pursuant to § 233.50(c), are not considered in determining the eligibility and payment of an otherwise eligible dependent child.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Applicants shall be informed about the eligibility requirements and their rights and obligations under the program. Under this requirement individuals are given information in written form, and orally as appropriate, about coverage, conditions of eligibility, scope of the program, and related services available, and the rights and responsibilities of applicants for and recipients of assistance. Specifically developed bulletins or pamphlets explaining the rules regarding eligibility and appeals in simple, understandable terms are publicized and available in quantity.</P>
            <P>(ii) Procedures shall be adopted which are designed to assure that recipients make timely and accurate reports of any change in circumstances which may affect their eligibility or the amount of assistance.</P>
            <P>(iii) All applicants for and recipients of assistance shall be notified in writing at the time of application and on redetermination that eligibility and income information will be regularly requested from agencies specified in § 205.55 and will be used to aid in determining their eligibility for assistance.</P>
            <P>(3) A decision shall be made promptly on applications, pursuant to reasonable State-established time standards not in excess of:</P>
            <P>(i) 45 days for OAA, AFDC, AB, AABD (for aged and blind); and</P>
            <P>(ii) 60 days for APTD, AABD (for disabled). Under this requirement, the applicant is informed of the agency's time standard in acting on applications which covers the time from date of application under the State plan to the date that the assistance check, or notification of denial of assistance or change of award is mailed to the applicant or recipient. The State's time standards apply except in unusual circumstances (e.g., where the agency cannot reach a decision because of failure or delay on the part of the applicant or an examining physician, or because of some administrative or other emergency that could not be controlled by the agency), in which instances the case record shows the cause for the delay. The agency's standards of promptness for acting on applications or redetermining eligibility shall not be used as a waiting period before granting aid, or as a basis for denial of an application or for terminating assistance.</P>
            <P>(4) Adequate notice shall be sent to applicants and recipients to indicate that assistance has been authorized (including the amount of financial assistance) or that it has been denied or terminated. Under this requirement, adequate notice means a written notice that contains a statement of the action taken, and the reasons for and specific regulations supporting such action, and an explanation of the individual's right to request a hearing.</P>

            <P>(5)(i) Financial assistance and medical care and services included in the plan shall be furnished promptly to eligible individuals without any delay attributable to the agency's administrative process, and shall be continued regularly to all eligible individuals until they are found to be ineligible. Under this requirement there must be <PRTPAGE P="41"/>arrangements to assist applicants and recipients in obtaining medical care and services in emergency situations on a 24-hour basis, 7 days a week.</P>
            <P>(ii) Assistance will not be denied, delayed, or discontinued pending receipt of income or other information requested under § 205.55, if other evidence establishes the individual's eligibility for assistance.</P>
            <P>(6) Assistance shall begin as specified in the State plan, which:</P>
            <P>(i) For financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(A) Must be no later than:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The date of authorization of payment, or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Thirty days in OAA, AFDC, AB, and AABD (as to the aged and blind), and 60 days in APTD and AABD (as to the disabled), from the date of receipt of a signed and completed application form, whichever is earlier: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the individuals then met all the eligibility conditions, and</P>
            <P>(B) For purposes of Federal financial participation in OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD, may be as early as the first of the month in which an application has been received and the individual meets all the eligibility conditions; and</P>
            <P>(C) In AFDC, for purposes of Federal financial participation, may be as early as the date of application provided that the assistance unit meets all the eligibility conditions; and</P>
            <P>(D) In AFDC, States that pay for the month of application must prorate the payment for that month by multiplying the amount payable if payment were made for the entire month including special needs in accordance with § 233.34 by the ratio of the days in the month including and following the date of application (or, at State option, the date of authorization of payment) to the total number of days in such month. The State plan may provide for using a standard 30-day month to determine the prorated amount.</P>
            <P>(7) In cases of proposed action to terminate, discontinue, suspend or reduce assistance, the agency shall give timely and adequate notice. Such notice shall comply with the provisions of § 205.10 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(8) Each decision regarding eligibility or ineligibility will be supported by facts in the applicant's or recipient's case record. Under this requirement each application is disposed of by a finding of eligibility or ineligibility unless:</P>
            <P>(i) The applicant voluntarily withdraws his application, and there is an entry in the case record that a notice has been sent to confirm the applicant's notification to the agency that he does not desire to pursue his application; or</P>
            <P>(ii) There is an entry in the case record that the application has been disposed of because the applicant died or could not be located.</P>
            <P>(9) Where an individual has been determined to be eligible, eligibility will be reconsidered or redetermined:</P>
            <P>(i) When required on the basis of information the agency has obtained previously about anticipated changes in the individual's situation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Promptly, after a report is obtained which indicates changes in the individual's circumstances that may affect the amount of assistance to which he is entitled or may make him ineligible; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Periodically, within agency established time standards, but not less frequently than every 12 months in OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD, on eligibility factors subject to change. For recipients of AFDC, all factors of eligibility will be redetermined at least every 6 months except in the case of monthly reporting cases or cases covered by an approved error-prone profiling system as specified in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section. Under the AFDC program, at least one face-to-face redetermination must be conducted in each case once in every 12 months.</P>
            <P>(iv) In accordance with paragraph (a)(9)(iii) of this section, under an alternative redetermination plan based on error-prone profiling, which has been approved by the Secretary, and includes:</P>
            <P>(A) A description of the statistical methodology used to develop the error-prone profile system upon which the redetermination schedule is based;</P>
            <P>(B) The criteria to be used to vary the scope of review and to assign different types of cases; and</P>

            <P>(C) A detailed outline of the evaluation system, including provisions for necessary changes in the error-prone <PRTPAGE P="42"/>output, such as types of cases, types of errors, frequencies of redeterminations and corrective action.</P>
            <P>(10) Standards and methods for determination of eligibility shall be consistent with the objectives of the programs, and will respect the rights of individuals under the United States Constitution, the Social Security Act, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and all other relevant provisions of Federal and State laws.</P>
            <P>(11) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(12) The State agency shall establish and maintain methods by which it shall be kept currently informed about local agencies' adherence to the State plan provisions and to the State agency's procedural requirements for determining eligibility, and it shall take corrective action when necessary.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Applicant</E> is a person who has, directly, or through his authorized representative, or where incompetent or incapacitated, through someone acting responsibly for him, made application for public assistance from the agency administering the program, and whose application has not been terminated.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Application</E> is the action by which an individual indicates in writing to the agency administering public assistance (on a form prescribed by the State agency) his desire to receive assistance. The relative with whom a child is living or will live ordinarily makes application for the child for AFDC. An application is distinguished from an inquiry, which is simply a request for information about eligibility requirements for public assistance. Such inquiry may be followed by an application. When an individual is required to be included in an existing assistance unit pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(vii), such individual will be considered to be included in the application, as of the date he is required to be included in the assistance unit.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Date of Application</E> is the date on which the action described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section occurs.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Redetermination</E> is a review of factors affecting AFDC eligibility and payment amount; e.g. continued absence, income (including child and spousal support), etc.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Assistance Unit</E> is the group of individuals whose income, resources and needs are considered as a unit for purposes of determining eligibility and the amount of payment.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Collections, compromise, or waiver of payment.</E> The Administrator may, in his discretion, where in his judgment substantial justice will be best served thereby or the probable recovery will not warrant the expense of collection, compromise, or waive the whole or any portion of, any claim for continuing care and treatment, and assistance, and in the process of arriving at such decision, the Administrator may make or cause to be made such investigations as may be necessary to determine the ability of the patient to pay or contribute toward the cost of his continuing care and treatment in a hospital.</P>

              <P>(a) The Administrator may, prior to a hearing under § 201.6 (a) or (b) of this chapter, notify the State in writing of additional issues which will be considered at the hearing, and such notice shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> If such notice is furnished to the State less than 20 days before the date of the hearing, the State or any other party, at its request, shall be granted a postponement of the hearing to a date 20 days after such notice was furnished, or such later date as may be agreed to by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) If, as a result of negotiations between the Department and the State, the submittal of a plan amendment, a change in the State program, or other actions by the State, any issue is resolved in whole or in part, but new or modified issues are presented, as specified by the Administrator, the hearing shall proceed on such new or modified issues.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If at any time, whether prior to, during, or after the hearing, the Administrator finds that the State has come into compliance with Federal requirements on any issue, in whole or in part, he shall remove such issue from the proceedings in whole or in part, as may be appropriate. If all issues are removed, he shall terminate the hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to the removal of any issue from the hearing, in whole or in part, the Administrator shall provide all parties other than the Department and the State (see § 213.15(b)) with the statement of his intention, and the reasons therefor, and a copy of the proposed State plan provision on which the State and he have settled, and the parties shall have opportunity to submit in writing within 15 days, for the Administrator's consideration and for the record, their views as to, or any information bearing upon, the merits of the proposed plan provision and the merits of the Administrator's reasons for removing the issue from the hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) The issues considered at the hearing shall be limited to those issues of which the State is notified as provided in § 213.11 and paragraph (a) of this section, and new or modified issues described in paragraph (b) of this section, and shall not include issues or parts of issues removed from the proceedings pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request to participate in hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Department and the State are parties to the hearing without making a specific request to participate.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) Other individuals or groups may be recognized as parties, if the <PRTPAGE P="52"/>issues to be considered at the hearing have caused them injury and their interest is within the zone of interests to be protected by the governing Federal statute.</P>

              <P>(2) Any individual or group wishing to participate as a party shall file a petition with the FSA Hearing Clerk within 15 days after notice of the hearing has been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and shall serve a copy on each party of record at that time, in accordance with § 213.5(b). Such petition shall concisely state (i) petitioner's interest in the proceeding, (ii) who will appear for petitioner, (iii) the issues on which petitioner wishes to participate, and (iv) whether petitioner intends to present witnesses.</P>
              <P>(3) Any party may, within 5 days of receipt of such petition, file comments thereon.</P>
              <P>(4) The presiding officer shall promptly determine whether each petitioner has the requisite interest in the proceedings and shall permit or deny participation accordingly. Where petitions to participate as parties are made by individuals or groups with common interests, the presiding officer may request all such petitioners to designate a single representative, or he may recognize one or more of such petitioners to represent all such petitioners. The presiding officer shall give each petitioner written notice of the decision on his petition, and if the petition is denied, he shall briefly state the grounds for denial.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Any interested person or organization wishing to participate as amicus curiae shall file a petition with the FSA Hearing Clerk before the commencement of the hearing. Such petition shall concisely state (i) the petitioner's interest in the hearing, (ii) who will represent the petitioner, and (iii) the issues on which petitioner intends to present argument. The presiding officer may grant the petition if he finds that the petitioner has a legitimate interest in the proceedings, that such participation will not unduly delay the outcome and may contribute materially to the proper disposition of the issues. An amicus curiae is not a party but may participate as provided in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(2) An amicus curiae may present a brief oral statement at the hearing, at the point in the proceedings specified by the presiding officer. He may submit a written statement of position to the presiding officer prior to the beginning of a hearing, and shall serve a copy on each party. He may also submit a brief or written statement at such time as the parties submit briefs, and shall serve a copy on each party.</P>

            <P>(1) Specify the groups of individuals, based on reasonable classifications, that will be included in the program, and all the conditions of eligibility that must be met by the individuals in the groups. The groups selected for inclusion in the plan and the eligibility conditions imposed must not exclude individuals or groups on an arbitrary or unreasonable basis, and must not result in inequitable treatment of individuals or groups in the light of the provisions and purposes of the public assistance titles of the Social Security Act. Under this requirement:</P>
            <P>(i) A State shall impose each condition of eligibility required by the Social Security Act; and</P>
            <P>(ii) A State may:</P>
            <P>(A) Provide more limited public assistance coverage than that provided by the Act only where the Social Security Act or its legislative history authorizes more limited coverage;</P>
            <P>(B) Impose conditions upon applicants for and recipients of public assistance which, if not satisfied, result in the denial or termination of public assistance, if such conditions assist the State in the efficient administration of its public assistance programs, or further an independent State welfare policy, and are not inconsistent with the provisions and purposes of the Social Security Act.</P>
            <P>(iii) There must be clarity as to what groups are included in the plan, and which are within, and which are outside, the scope of Federal financial participation.</P>
            <P>(iv) Eligibility conditions must be applied on a consistent and equitable basis throughout the State.</P>
            <P>(v) A plan under title XVI must have the same eligibility conditions and other requirements for the aged, blind, and disabled, except as otherwise specifically required or permitted by the Act.</P>

            <P>(3) In addition, a State plan under title IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act, must: Provided that no aid or assistance will be provided under the plan to an individual with respect to a period for which he is receiving aid or assistance under a State plan approved under any other of such titles or under title I of the Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal financial participation.</E> (1) The provisions which govern Federal financial participation in assistance payments are set forth in the Social Security Act, throughout this chapter, and in other policy issuances of the Secretary. Where indicated, State plan provisions are prerequisite to Federal financial participation with respect to the applicable group and payments. State plan provisions on need, the amount of assistance, and eligibility determine the limits of Federal financial participation. Federal financial <PRTPAGE P="58"/>participation is excluded from assistance payments in which the State refuses to participate because of the failure of a local authority to apply such State plan provisions.</P>
            <P>(2) The following is a summary statement regarding the groups for whom Federal financial participation is available. (More detailed information is given elsewhere.)</P>
            <P>(i) OAA—for needy individuals under the plan who are 65 years of age or older.</P>
            <P>(ii) AFDC—for:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Needy children under the plan who are:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Under the age of 18, or age 18 if a full-time student in a secondary school, or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical training, and reasonably expected to complete the program before reaching age 19;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, or unemployment of a principal earner, and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Living in the home of a parent or of certain relatives specified in the Act.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The parent(s) of a dependent child, a caretaker relative (other than a parent) of a dependent child, and, in certain situations, a parent's spouse.</P>
            <P>(iii) AB—for needy individual's under the plan who are blind.</P>
            <P>(iv) APTD—for needy individuals under the plan who are 18 years of age or older and permanently and totally disabled.</P>
            <P>(v) AABD—for needy individuals under the plan who are aged, blind, or 18 years of age or older and permanently and totally disabled.</P>
            <P>(3) Federal financial participation is available in assistance payments made for the entire month in accordance with the State plan if the individual was eligible for a portion of the month, provided that the individual was eligible on the date that the payment was made; except that where it has been determined that the State agency had previously denied assistance to which the individual was entitled, Federal financial participation will be provided in any corrective payment regardless of whether the individual is eligible on the date that the corrective payment is made.</P>
            <P>(4) Federal financial participation is available in assistance payments which are continued in accordance with the State plan, for a temporary period during which the effects of an eligibility condition are being overcome, e.g., blindness in AB, disability in APTD, physical or mental incapacity, continued absence of a parent, or unemployment of a principal earner in AFDC.</P>
            <P>(5) Where changed circumstances or a hearing decision makes the individual ineligible for any assistance, or eligible for a smaller amount of assistance than was actually paid, Federal financial participation is available in excess payments to such individuals, for not more than one month following the month in which the circumstances changed or the hearing decision was rendered. Federal financial participation is available where assistance is required to be continued unadjusted because a hearing has been requested.</P>

            <P>(ii) Provide that the needs, income, and resources of individuals receiving SSI benefits under title XVI, individuals with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom State or local foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made, or individuals with respect to whom State or local adoption assistance payments are made, for the period for which such benefits or payments <PRTPAGE P="59"/>are received, shall not be included in determining the need and the amount of the assistance payment of an AFDC assistance unit; except that the needs, income, and resources of an individual with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made, or individuals with respect to whom State or local adoption assistance payments are made are included in determining the need and the amount of the assistance payment for an AFDC assistance unit of which the individual would otherwise be regarded as a member where the amount of the assistance payment that the unit would receive would not be reduced by including the needs, income, and resources of such individual. Under this requirement, “individuals receiving SSI benefits under title XVI” include individuals receiving mandatory or optional State supplementary payments under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act or under section 212 of Public Law 93-66, and “individuals with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made” means a child with respect to whom Federal foster care maintenance payments under section 472(b) and defined in section 475(4)(A) of title IV-E of the Social Security Act are made, and a child whose costs in a foster family home or child care institution are covered by the Federal foster care maintenance payments made with respect to his or her minor parent under sections 472(h) and 475(4)(B) of title IV-E. “Individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made” means a child who receives payments made under an approved title IV-E plan based on an adoption assistance agreement between the State and the adoptive parents of a child with special needs, pursuant to sections 473 and 475(3) of the Social Security Act.</P>
            <P>(iii) For AFDC, when an individual who is required to be included in the assistance unit pursuant to § 206.10(a)(1)(vii) is also required to be included in another assistance unit, those assistance units must be consolidated, and treated as one assistance unit for purposes of determining eligibility and the amount of payment.</P>
            <P>(iv) For AFDC, when a State learns of an individual who is required to be included in the assistance unit after the date he or she is required to be included in the unit, the State must redetermine the assistance unit's eligibility and payment amount, including the need, income, and resources of the individual. This redetermination must be retroactive to the date that the individual was required to be in the assistance unit either through birth/adoption or by becoming a member of the household. Any resulting overpayment must be recovered or corrective payment made pursuant to § 233.20(a)(13).</P>
            <P>(v) In determining need and the amount of payment for AFDC, all income and resources of an individual required to be in the assistance unit, but subject to sanction under § 250.34 or because of an intentional program violation under the optional fraud control program implementing section 416 of the Social Security Act, are considered available to the assistance unit to the same extent that they would be if the person were not subject to a sanction. However, the needs of the sanctioned individual(s) are not considered. In accord with § 250.34(c), if a parent in an AFDC-UP case is sanctioned pursuant to § 233.100(a)(5), the needs of the second parent are not taken into account in determining the family's need for assistance and the amount of the assistance payment unless the second parent is participating in the JOBS program. An individual required to be in an assistance unit pursuant to § 206.10(a)(1)(vii) but who fails to cooperate in meeting a condition of his or her eligibility for assistance is a sanctioned individual whose needs, income, and resources are treated in the manner described above.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards of assistance.</E> (i) Specify a statewide standard, expressed in money amounts, to be used in determining (<E T="03">a</E>) the need of applicants and recipients and (<E T="03">b</E>) the amount of the assistance payment.</P>

            <P>(ii) In the AFDC plan, provide that by July 1, 1969, the State's standard of assistance for the AFDC program will have been adjusted to reflect fully changes in living costs since such standards were established, and any maximums that the State imposes on the amount of aid paid to families will have been proportionately adjusted. In <PRTPAGE P="60"/>such adjustment a consolidation of the standard (i.e., combining of items) may not result in a reduction in the content of the standard. In the event the State is not able to meet need in full under the adjusted standard, the State may make ratable reductions in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(viii) of this section. Nevertheless, if a State maintains a system of dollar maximums these maximums must be proportionately adjusted in relation to the updated standards.</P>
            <P>(iii) Provide that the standard will be uniformly applied throughout the State except as provided under § 239.54.</P>
            <P>(iv) Include the method used in determining need and the amount of the assistance payment. For AFDC, the method must provide for rounding down to the next lower whole dollar when the result of determining the standard of need or the payment amount is not a whole dollar. Proration under § 206.10(a)(6)(i)(D) to determine the amount of payment for the month of application must occur before rounding to determine the payment amount for that month.</P>
            <P>(v) If the State IV-A agency includes special need items in its standard:</P>
            <P>(A) Describe those that will be recognized and the circumstances under which they will be included, and</P>
            <P>(B) Provide that they will be considered for all applicants and recipients requiring them; except that:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Under AFDC, work expenses and child care (or care of incapacitated adults living in the same home and receiving AFDC) resulting from employment or participation in either a CWEP or an employment search program cannot be special needs, and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In a State which has a JOBS program under part 250, child care, transportation, work-related expenses, other work-related supportive services, and the costs of education (including tuition, books, and fees) resulting from participation in JOBS (including participation pursuant to §§ 250.46, 250.47, and 250.48) or any other education or training activity cannot be special needs.</P>
            <P>(vi) If the State chooses to establish the need of the individual on a basis that recognizes, as essential to his well-being, the presence in the home of other needy individuals, (A) specify the persons whose needs will be included in the individual's need, and (B) provide that the decision as to whether any individual will be recognized as essential to the recipient's well-being shall rest with the recipient.</P>
            <P>(vii) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(viii) Provide that the money amount of any need item included in the standard will not be prorated or otherwise reduced solely because of the presence in the household of a non-legally responsible individual; and the agency will not assume any contribution from such individual for the support of the assistance unit except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(xiv) and (a)(5) of this section and § 233.51 of this part.</P>

            <P>(ix) For AFDC, provide that a State shall consider utility payments made in lieu of any direct rental payment to a landlord or public housing agency to be shelter costs for applicants or recipients living in housing assisted under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended, and section 236 of the National Housing Act. The amount considered as a shelter payment shall not exceed the total amount the applicant or recipient is expected to contribute for the cost of housing as determined by HUD. <E T="03">Utility payments</E> means only those payments made directly to a utility company or supplier which are for gas, electricity, water, heating fuel, sewerage systems, and trash and garbage collection. Utility payments are made “in lieu of any direct rental payment to a landlord or public housing agency” when, and only when, the AFDC family pays its entire required contribution at HUD's direction to one or more utility companies and does not make any direct payment to the landlord or the public housing agency. Housing covered by “the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended, and section 236 of the National Housing Act” means Department of Housing and Urban Development assisted housing which includes Indian and public housing, section 8 new and existing rental housing, and section 236 rental housing.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Income and resources.</E> (i)(A) <E T="03">OAA, AB, APTD, AABD,</E> Specify the amount and types of real and personal property, including liquid assets, that may be reserved, i.e., retained to meet the <PRTPAGE P="61"/>current and future needs while assistance is received on a continuing basis. In addition to the home, personal effects, automobile and income producing property allowed by the agency, the amount of real and personal property, including liquid assets, that can be reserved for each individual recipient shall not be in excess of two thousand dollars. Policies may allow reasonable proportions of income from businesses or farms to be used to increase capital assets, so that income may be increased; and (B) in AFDC—The amount of real and personal property that can be reserved for each assistance unit shall not be in excess of one thousand dollars equity value (or such lesser amount as the State specifies in its State plan) excluding only:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The home which is the usual residence of the assistance unit;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) One automobile, up to $1,500 of equity value or such lower limit as the State may specify in the State plan; (any excess equity value must be applied towards the general resource limit specified in the State plan);</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) One burial plot (as defined in the State plan) for each member of the assistance unit;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Bona fide funeral agreements (as defined and within limits specified in the State plan) up to a total of $1,500 in equity value or such lower limit as the State may specify in the State plan for each member of the assistance unit (any excess equity value must be applied towards the general resource limit specified in the State plan). This provision addresses only formal agreements for funeral and burial expenses such as burial contracts, burial trusts or other funeral arrangements (generally with licensed funeral directors) and does not apply to other assets (e.g., passbook bank accounts, simple set-aside of savings, and cash surrender value of life insurance policies);</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Real property for a period of six consecutive months (or, at the option of the State, nine consecutive months) which the family is making a good faith effort (as defined in the State plan) to sell, subject to the following provisions. The family must sign an agreement to dispose of the property and to repay the amount of aid received during such period that would not have been paid had the property been sold at the beginning of such period, but not to exceed the amount of the net proceeds of the sale. The family has five working days from the date it realizes cash from the sale of the excess real property to repay the overpayment; failure to make repayment within this period results in the cash being considered to be an available resource. If the family becomes ineligible for AFDC for any other reason during the conditional payment period while making a good faith effort to sell the property, or fails to sell the property by the end of the period despite such a good faith effort, then the amount of the overpayment attributable to the real property will not be determined and recovery will not be begun until the property is, in fact, sold. However, if the property was intentionally sold at less than fair market value so that a good faith effort to sell it was not made, or if it is otherwise determined that a good faith effort to sell the property is not being made, the overpayment amount shall be computed using the fair market value determined at the beginning of the period. For applicants, the conditional payment period begins with the first payment month for which all otherwise applicable eligibility conditions are met and payment is authorized. For recipients who acquire property while receiving assistance, the period begins with the payment month in which the recipient receives the property; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) At State option, basic maintenance items essential to day-to-day living such as clothes, furniture and other similarly essential items of limited value.</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide that in determining need and the amount of the assistance payment, after all policies governing the reserves and allowances and disregard or setting aside of income and resources referred to in this section have been uniformly applied:</P>
            <P>(A) In determining need, all remaining income and resources shall be considered in relation to the State's need standard;</P>

            <P>(B) In determining financial eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment all remaining income (except unemployment compensation received <PRTPAGE P="62"/>by an unemployed principal earner) and, except for AFDC, all resources may be considered in relation to either the State's need standard or the State's payment standard. Unemployment compensation received by an unemployed principal earner shall be considered only by subtracting it from the amount of the assistance payment after the payment has been determined under the State's payment method;</P>
            <P>(C) States may have policies which provide for allocating an individual's income for his or her own support if the individual is not applying for or receiving assistance; for the support of other individuals living in the same household but not receiving assistance; and for the support of other individuals living in another household. Such other individuals are those who are or could be claimed by the individual as dependents for determining Federal personal income tax liability, or those he or she is legally obligated to support. No income may be allocated to meet the needs of an individual who has been sanctioned under § 224.51, § 232.11(a)(2), § 232.12(d), § 238.22 or § 240.22 or who is required to be included in the assistance unit and has failed to cooperate. The amount allocated for the individual and the other individuals who are living in the home must not exceed the State's need standard amount for a family group of the same composition. The amount allocated for individuals not living in the home must not exceed the amount actually paid.</P>
            <P>(D) Income after application of disregards, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section, and resources available for current use shall be considered. To the extent not inconsistent with any other provision of this chapter, income and resources are considered available both when actually available and when the applicant or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support and maintenance.</P>
            <P>(E) For AFDC, income tax refunds, but such payments shall be considered as resources; and</P>
            <P>(F) When the AFDC assistance unit's income, after applying applicable disregards, exceeds the State need standard for the family because of receipt of nonrecurring earned or unearned lump sum income (including for AFDC, title II and other retroactive monthly benefits, and payments in the nature of a windfall, e.g., inheritances or lottery winnings, personal injury and worker compensation awards, to the extent it is not earmarked and used for the purpose for which it is paid, i.e., monies for back medical bills resulting from accidents or injury, funeral and burial costs, replacement or repair of resources, etc.), the family will be ineligible for aid for the full number of months derived by dividing the sum of the lump sum income and other income by the monthly need standard for a family of that size. Any income remaining from this calculation is income in the first month following the period of ineligibility. The period of ineligibility shall begin with the month of receipt of the nonrecurring income or, at State option, as late as the corresponding payment month. For purposes of applying the lump sum provision, family includes all persons whose needs are taken into account in determining eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment, and includes solely for determining the income and resources of a family an individual who must be in a family pursuant to § 206.10(a)(1)(vii) but who does not meet a condition of his or her eligibility due to a failure to cooperate or is required by law to have his or her needs excluded from an assistance unit's AFDC grant calculation due to the failure to perform some action. A State may shorten the remaining period of ineligibility when: the standard of need increases and the amount the family would have received also changes (e.g., situations involving additions to the family unit during the period of ineligibility of persons who are otherwise eligible for assistance); the lump sum income or a portion thereof becomes unavailable to the family for a reason beyond the control of the family; or the family incurs and pays for medical expenses. If the State chooses to shorten the period of ineligibility, the State plan shall:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identify which of the above situations are included;<PRTPAGE P="63"/>
            </P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In the case of situations involving an increase in the need standard and changes in the amount that should have been paid to the family, specify the types of circumstances which will be included;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) In the case of situations involving the unavailability of the lump sum income, include a definition of unavailability, and specify what reasons will be considered beyond the control of the family; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) In the case of situations involving the payment of medical expenses, specify the types of medical expenses the State will allow to be offset against the lump sum income.
            </P>
            <FP>For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3): Automobile means a passenger car or other motor vehicle used to provide transportation of persons or goods. (In AFDC, in appropriate geographic areas, one alternate primary mode of transportation may be substituted for the automobile); Equity value means fair market value minus encumbrances (legal debts); Fair market value means the price an item of a particular make, model, size, material or condition will sell for on the open market in the geographic area involved (If a motor vehicle is especially equipped with apparatus for the handicapped, the apparatus shall not increase the value of the vehicle); Liquid assets are those properties in the form of cash or other financial instruments which are convertible to cash and include savings accounts, checking accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares, promissory notes, mortgages, cash value of insurance policies, and similar properties; Need standard means the money value assigned by the State to the basic and special needs it recognizes as essential for applicants and recipients; Payment standard means the amount from which non-exempt income is subtracted.</FP>
            
            <P>(iii) States may prorate income received by individuals employed on a contractual basis over the period of the contract or may prorate intermittent income received quarterly, semiannually, or yearly over the period covered by the income. In OAA, AB, APTD and AABD, they may use the prorated amount to determine need under § 233.23 and the amount of the assistance payment under §§ 233.24 and 233.25. In AFDC, they may use the prorated amount to determine need under § 233.33 and the amount of the assistance payment under §§ 233.34 and 233.35.</P>
            <P>(iv) Provide that in determining the availability of income and resources, the following will not be included as income:</P>
            <P>(A) Except for AFDC, income equal to expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of income (including earnings from public service employment);</P>
            <P>(B) Grants, such as scholarships, obtained and used under conditions that preclude their use for current living costs;</P>
            <P>(C) Home produce of an applicant or recipient, utilized by him and his household for their own consumption;</P>
            <P>(D) For AFDC, any amounts paid by a State IV-A agency from State-only funds to meet needs of children receiving AFDC, if the payments are made under a statutorily-established State program which has been continuously in effect since before January 1, 1979;</P>
            <P>(E) For AFDC, income tax refunds, but such payments shall be considered as resources; and</P>
            <P>(F) At State option, small nonrecurring gifts, such as those for Christmas, birthdays and graduations, not to exceed $30 per recipient in any quarter; and</P>
            <P>(G) For AFDC, the amount paid to the family by the IV-A agency under § 232.20(d) or, in a State that treats direct support payments as income under § 233.20(a)(3)(v)(B), the first $50 received by the assistance unit which represents a current monthly support obligation or a voluntary support payment. In no case shall the total amount disregarded exceed $50 per month per assistance unit.</P>
            <P>(v) Provide that agency policies will assure that:</P>
            <P>(A) In determining eligibility for an assistance payment, support payments assigned under § 232.11 of this chapter will be treated in accordance with § 232.20 and § 232.21 of this chapter; and</P>

            <P>(B) In determining the amount of an assistance payment, assigned support payments retained in violation of § 232.12(b)(4) of this chapter, will be counted as income to meet need unless the approved IV-A State plan provides <PRTPAGE P="64"/>that such support payments are subject to IV-D recovery under §§ 302.31(a)(3) and 303.80 of this title or unless such payments are sufficient to render the family ineligible as provided at § 232.20 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(vi)(A) In family groups living together, income of the spouse is considered available for his spouse and income of a parent is considered available for children under 21, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(xiv) and (a)(3)(xviii) of this section for AFDC. If an individual is a spouse or parent who is a recipient of SSI benefits under title XVI, an individual with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made, an individual with respect to whom State or local foster care payments are made, an individual with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made, or an individual with respect to whom State or local adoption assistance payments are made, then, for the period for which such benefits or payments are received, his or her income and resources shall not be counted as income and resources available to the AFDC unit except that a child receiving adoption assistance payments will not be excluded if such exclusion would cause the AFDC benefits of the assistance unit of which the child would otherwise be considered a member to be reduced. For purposes of this exception, “a recipient of SSI benefits under title XVI” includes a spouse or parent receiving mandatory or optional State supplementary payments under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act or under section 212 of Public Law 93-66 and an “individual with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made” means a child with respect to whom Federal foster care maintenance payments are made under section 472(b) and defined in section 475(4)(A) of the Act, and a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments made with respect to his or her minor parent under sections 472(h) and 475(4)(B) of the Act. “Individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made” means a child who receives payments made under an approved title IV-E plan based on an adoption assistance agreement between the State and the adoptive parents of a child with special needs, pursuant to sections 473 and 475(3) of the Social Security Act.</P>
            <P>(B) Income of an alien parent, who is disqualified pursuant to § 233.50(c) is considered available to the otherwise eligible child by applying the stepparent deeming formula at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(xiv).</P>

            <P>(vii) If the State agency establishes policy under which assistance from other agencies and organizations will not be deducted in determining the amount of assistance to be paid, provide that no duplication shall exist between such other assistance and that provided by the public assistance agency. In such complementary program relationships, nonduplication shall be assured by provision that such aid will be considered in relation to: (<E T="03">a</E>) The different purpose for which the other agency grants aid such as vocational rehabilitation; (<E T="03">b</E>) the provision of goods and services that are not included in the statewide standard of the public assistance agency, e.g., a private agency might provide money for special training for a child or for medical care when the public assistance agency does not carry this responsibility; or housing and urban development payments might be provided to cover moving expenses that are not included in the assistance standard; or (<E T="03">c</E>) the fact that public assistance funds are insufficient to meet the total amount of money determined to be needed in accordance with the statewide standard. In such instances, grants by other agencies in an amount sufficient to make it possible for the individual to have the amount of money determined to be needed, in accordance with the public assistance agency standard, will not constitute duplication.</P>

            <P>(viii) Provide that: (A) Payment will be based on the determination of the amount of assistance needed; (B) if full individual payments are precluded by maximums or insufficient funds, adjustments will be made by methods applied uniformly statewide; (C) in the case of AFDC no payment of aid shall be made to an assistance unit in any month in which the amount of aid prior to any adjustments is determined <PRTPAGE P="65"/>to be less than $10; and (D) an individual who is denied aid because of the limitation specified in (C) of this section, or because the payment amount is determined to be zero as a result of rounding the payment amount as required by § 233.20(a)(2)(iv), shall be deemed a recipient of aid for all other purposes except participation in the Community Work Experience Program.</P>
            <P>(ix) Provide that the agency will establish and carry out policies with reference to applicants' and recipients' potential sources of income that can be developed to a state of availability.</P>
            <P>(x) Provide that the income and resources of individuals receiving SSI benefits under title XVI, individuals with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom State or local foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made, or individuals with respect to whom State or local adoption assistance payments are made, for the period for which such benefits or payments are received, shall not be counted as income and resources of an assistance unit applying for or receiving assistance under title IV-A; except that a child receiving adoption assistance payments will not be excluded if such exclusion would cause the AFDC benefits of the assistance unit of which the child would otherwise be considered a member to be reduced. Under this requirement, “individuals receiving SSI benefits under title XVI” include individuals receiving mandatory or optional State supplementary payments under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act or under section 212 of Public Law 93-66 and, “individuals with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made” means a child with respect to whom Federal foster care maintenance payments are made under section 472(b) and defined in section 475(4)(A) of the Act, and a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by foster care maintenance payments made with respect to his or her minor parent under sections 472(h) and 475(4)(B) of the Act. “Individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made” means a child who receives payments made under an approved title IV-E plan based on an adoption assistance agreement between the State and the adoptive parents of a child with special needs, pursuant to sections 473 and 475(3) of the Social Security Act.</P>
            <P>(xi) In the case of AFDC if the State chooses to count the value of the food stamp coupons as income, provide that the State plan shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Identify the amount for food included in its need and payment standards for an assistance unit of the same size and composition. (States which have a flat grant system must estimate the amount based on historical data or some other justifiable procedure.); and</P>
            <P>(B) Specify the amount of such food stamp coupons that it will count as income. Under this requirement, the amount of food stamp coupons which a State may count as income may not exceed the amount for food established in its payment standard for an assistance unit of the same size and composition.</P>
            <P>(xii) In the case of AFDC if the State chooses to count the value of the governmental rent or housing subsidies as income, provide that the State plan shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Identify the amount for shelter included in its need and payment standards for an assistance unit of the same size and composition. (States which have a flat grant system must estimate this amount based on historical data or some other justifiable procedure.); and</P>
            <P>(B) Specify the amount of such housing assistance that it will count as income. Under this requirement, the amount of such rent or housing subsidies which a State may count as income may not exceed the amount for shelter established in its payment standard for assistance unit of the same size and composition.</P>

            <P>(xiii) Under the AFDC plan, provide that no assistance unit is eligible for aid in any month in which the unit's income (other than the assistance payment) exceeds 185 percent of the State's need standard (including special needs) for a family of the same composition (including special needs), without application of the disregards in paragraph (a)(11)(i) (except to the <PRTPAGE P="66"/>extent provided for under paragraph (a)(3)(xix)), paragraph (a)(11)(ii) and paragraph (a)(11)(viii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(xiv) For AFDC, in States that do not have laws of general applicability holding the stepparent legally responsible to the same extent as the natural or adoptive parent, the State agency shall count as income to the assistance unit the income of the stepparent (i.e., one who is married, under State law, to the child's parent) of an AFDC child who is living in the household with the child after applying the following disregards (exception: if the stepparent is included in the assistance unit, the disregard under paragraph (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of this section apply instead:</P>
            <P>(A) The first $90 of the gross earned income of the stepparent;</P>
            <P>(B) An additional amount for the support of the stepparent and any other individuals who are living in the home, but whose needs are not taken into account in making the AFDC eligibility determinations except for sanctioned individuals or individuals who are required to be included in the assistance unit but have failed to cooperate and are or could be claimed by the stepparent as dependents for purposes of determining his or her Federal personal income tax liability. This disregarded amount shall equal the State's need standard amount for a family group of the same composition as the stepparent and those other individuals described in the preceding sentence;</P>
            <P>(C) Amounts actually paid by the stepparent to individuals not living in the home but who are or could be claimed by him or her as dependents for purposes of determining his or her Federal personal income tax liability; and</P>
            <P>(D) Payments by such stepparent of alimony or child support with respect to individuals not living in the household.</P>
            <P>(xv) For AFDC, provide for the consideration of the income and resources of an alien's sponsor who is an individual as provided in § 233.51.</P>
            <P>(xvi) For AFDC, provide that in considering the availability of income and resources, support and maintenance assistance (including home energy assistance) will be taken into account in accordance with § 233.53.</P>
            <P>(xvii) In the case of AFDC, if the State chooses to disregard monthly income of any dependent child when the income is derived from participation in a program under the JTPA, provide that the State plan shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Identify from which programs under the JTPA, income will be disregarded;</P>
            <P>(B) In the case of earned income, specify what amount will be disregarded, and the length of time the disregard will be applicable (up to six months per calendar year); and</P>

            <P>(xviii) For AFDC, in the case of a dependent child whose parent is a minor under the age of 18 (without regard to school attendance), the State shall count as income to the assistance unit the income, after appropriate disregards, of such minor's own parent(s) living in the same household as the minor and dependent child. The disregards to be applied are the same as are applied to the income of a stepparent pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(xiv) of this section. However, in applying the disregards, each employed parent will receive the benefit of the work expense disregard in paragraph (a)(3)(xiv)(A) of this section.</P>
            <P>(xix) In the case of AFDC, if the State chooses to disregard monthly earned income of dependent children who are full-time students in the determination of whether the family's income exceeds the limit under § 233.20(a)(3)(xiii) of this section, provide that the State plan shall specify what amounts will be disregarded and the length of time the disregard will be applicable (up to six months per calendar year) except that earned income derived from participation in a program under the JTPA may only be disregarded under this paragraph, paragraph (a)(3)(xvii) or a combination of both paragraphs for a total of 6 months per calendar year.</P>

            <P>(xx) In the case of AFDC, if the State chooses to disregard in the determination of eligibility the monthly earned <PRTPAGE P="67"/>income of dependent children applying for AFDC who are full-time students, provide that the State plan shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Specify the amount that will be disregarded, and</P>
            <P>(B) Provide that the disregard shall only apply to the extent that the earned income is also disregarded pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(xix) of this section.</P>
            <P>(xxi) Provide that the principal of a bona fide loan will not be counted as income or resources in the determination of eligibility and the amount of assistance. Interest earned on a loan is counted as unearned income in the month received and as resources thereafter and purchases made with a loan are counted as resources. For purposes of this paragraph, a loan is considered bona fide when it meets objective and reasonable criteria included in the State plan.</P>

            <P>(5) <E T="03">Proration of shelter, utilities, and similar needs in AFDC.</E> (i) Provide that the State agency may prorate allowances in the need and payment standards for shelter, utilities, and similar needs when the AFDC assistance unit lives together with other individuals as a household; except that, the State shall not prorate with respect to any person receiving SSI to whom the statutory one-third reduction (section 1612(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act) is applied, or prorate when a bona fide landlord-tenant relationship exists. If the State chooses to prorate under this paragraph, it must prorate both the need standard and payment standard.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the State agency elects to prorate allowances for shelter, utilities, and similar needs the State plan must:</P>
            <P>(A) Indicate which allowances will be prorated, and describe the procedure which will be used to prorate the allowances;</P>
            <P>(B) Provide that the allowances will be prorated on a reasonable basis; and</P>
            <P>(C) Specify the circumstances under which proration will occur, including a description of which individuals are considered to be living with an AFDC assistance unit as a household.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Disregard of earned income; definition.</E> Provide that for purposes of disregarding earned income the agency policies will include:</P>
            <P>(i) A definition of <E T="03">earned income</E> in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(6) (iii) through (ix) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Provision for disregarding earned income for the period during which it is earned, rather than when it is paid, in cases of lump-sum payment for services rendered over a period of more than 1 month.</P>

            <P>(iii) The term earned income encompasses income in cash or in kind earned by an individual through the receipt of wages, salary, commissions, or profit from activities in which he is engaged as a self-employed individual or as an employee. For AFDC, <E T="03">earned income</E> means gross earned income prior to any deductions for taxes or for any other purposes, except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(v). Such earned income may be derived from his own employment, such as a business enterprise, or farming; or derived from wages or salary received as an employee. It includes earnings over a period of time for which settlement is made at one given time, as in the instance of sale of farm crops, livestock, or poultry. For OAA, AB, APTD and AABD only, in considering income from farm operation, the option available for reporting under OASDI, namely the <E T="03">cash receipts and disbursements</E> method, i.e., a record of actual gross, of expenses, and of net, is an individual determination and is acceptable also for these assistance programs.</P>

            <P>(iv) With reference to commissions, wages, or salary, the term <E T="03">earned income</E> means the total amount, irrespective of personal expenses, such as income-tax deductions, lunches, and transportation to and from work, and irrespective of expenses of employment which are not personal, such as the cost of tools, materials, special uniforms, or transportation to call on customers.</P>

            <P>(v)(A) For OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD, with respect to self-employment, the term <E T="03">earned income</E> means <PRTPAGE P="70"/>the total profit from business enterprise, farming, etc., resulting from a comparison of the gross income received with the <E T="03">business expenses,</E> i.e., total cost of the production of the income. Personal expenses, such as income-tax payments, lunches, and transportation to and from work, are not classified as business expenses.</P>
            <P>(B) For AFDC, with respect to self-employment the term <E T="03">earned income</E> means the total profit from business enterprise, farming, etc., resulting from a comparison of the gross receipts with the <E T="03">business expenses,</E> i.e., expenses directly related to producing the goods or services and without which the goods or services could not be produced. However, items such as depreciation, personal business and entertainment expenses, personal transportation, purchase of capital equipment and payments on the principal of loans for capital assets or durable goods are not business expenses.</P>
            <P>(vi) The definition shall exclude the following from <E T="03">earned income:</E> Returns from capital investment with respect to which the individual is not himself actively engaged, as in a business (for example, under most circumstances, dividends and interest would be excluded from <E T="03">earned income</E>); benefits (not in the nature of wages, salary, or profit) accruing as compensation, or reward for service, or as compensation for lack of employment (for example, pensions and benefits, such as United Mine Workers' benefits or veterans' benefits).</P>
            <P>(vii) With regard to the degree of activity, earned income is income produced as a result of the performance of services by a recipient; in other words, income which the individual earns by his own efforts, including managerial responsibilities, would be properly classified as earned income, such as management of capital investment in real estate. Conversely, for example, in the instance of capital investment wherein the individual carries no specific responsibility, such as where rental properties are in the hands of rental agencies and the check is forwarded to the recipient, the income would not be classified as earned income.</P>
            <P>(viii) Reserves accumulated from earnings are given no different treatment than reserves accumulated from any other sources.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Disregard of earned income; method.</E> (i) Provide that for other than AFDC, the following method will be used for disregarding earned income: The applicable amounts of earned income to be disregarded will be deducted from the gross amount of <E T="03">earned income,</E> and all work expenses, personal and non-personal, will then be deducted. Only the net amount remaining will be applied in determining need and the amount of the assistance payment.</P>
            <P>(ii) In applying the $30 and one-third disregard under paragraph (a)(11)(i)(D) of this section to an applicant for AFDC, there will be a preliminary step to determine whether the assistance unit is eligible without applying the disregard to the individual's earned income, by comparing the applicant's gross earned income (less the disregards in paragraphs (a)(11)(i) (A), (B) and (C)) and all of the assistance unit's other income to the State need standard. This preliminary step does not apply if the individual has received AFDC in one of the four months prior to the month of application.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Disregard of earned income applicable only to OAA, APTD, or AABD.</E> If the State chooses to disregard earned income, specify the amount to be disregarded of the first $80 per month of income that is earned by an aged or disabled individual claiming OAA, APTD, or AABD, who is not blind, but not more than $20 per month plus one-half of the next $60 of such earned income.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Disregard of income and resources applicable only to APTD or AABD.</E> If the State chooses to disregard income (which may be additional to the income disregarded under paragraph (a)(8) of this section) or resources for a disabled individual to achieve the fulfillment of a plan of self-support, provide that the amounts of additional income and resources will not exceed those found necessary for the period during which the individual is actually undergoing vocational rehabilitation, and specify the period, not in excess of 36 months, for which such amounts are to be disregarded.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Disregard of income and resources applicable only to AB or AABD.</E> Provide <PRTPAGE P="71"/>that, in determining the need of individuals who are blind, (i) the first $85 per month of earned income of the individual plus one-half of earned income in excess of $85 per month will be disregarded; and (ii) if the individual has a plan for achieving self-support, such additional income and resources as are necessary to fulfill such plan will be disregarded for a period not in excess of 12 months. Such additional income and resources may be disregarded for an additional period not in excess of 24 months (for a total of 36 months), as specified in the State plan.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Disregard of income and resources applicable only to AFDC.</E> (i) For purposes of eligibility determination, the State must disregard from the monthly earned income, i.e., earned income as defined in § 233.20(a)(6)(iii), of each individual whose needs are included in the eligibility determination:</P>
            <P>(A) Disregard all of the monthly earned income of each child receiving AFDC if the child is a full-time student or is a part-time student who is not a full-time employee. A student is one who is attending a school, college, or university or a course of vocational or technical training designed to fit him or her for gainful employment and includes a participant in the Job Corps program under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).</P>
            <P>(B) The first $90.</P>
            <P>(C) Where appropriate, an amount equal to $30 plus one-third of the earned income not already disregarded under paragraphs (a)(11)(i), (a)(11)(v) and (a)(11)(vi) of this section of an individual who received assistance in one of the four prior months.</P>
            <P>(D) An amount equal to the actual cost for the care of each dependent child or incapacitated adult living in the same home and receiving AFDC, but not to exceed $175 for each dependent child who is at least age two or each incapacitated adult, and not to exceed $200 for each dependent child who is under age two. For individuals not engaged in full-time employment or not employed throughout the month, the $175 and $200 disregard limits may be applied, or the State agency may establish disregard limits less than $175 and $200.</P>
            <P>(E) Where appropriate, $30 of the earned income not already disregarded under paragraphs (a)(11) (i), (v), and (vi) of this section, in the case of an individual who reapplies for assistance within the eight-month period that he/she is eligible for the $30 disregard.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of benefit calculation for individuals found eligible under paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this section, the following disregards must be made by the State:</P>
            <P>(A) Disregard all of the monthly earned income of each child receiving AFDC if the child is a full-time student or is a part-time student who is not a full-time employee. A student is one who is attending a school, college, or university or a course of vocational or technical training designed to fit him or her for gainful employment and includes a participant in the Job Corps program under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).</P>
            <P>(B) Disregard from any other individual's earned income the amounts specified in paragraphs (a)(11)(i)(B) and (a)(11)(i)(D) of this section, and $30 plus one-third of the individual's earned income not already disregarded under paragraphs (a)(11)(ii) and (a)(11)(v) of this section. However, the State may not provide the one-third portion of the disregard to an individual after the fourth consecutive month (any month for which the unit loses the $30 plus one-third disregard because of a provision in paragraph (a)(11)(iii) of this section, shall be considered as one of these months) it has been applied to the individual's earned income and may not apply the $30 disregard after the eighth month following the fourth consecutive month (regardless of whether the $30 disregard was actually applied in those months) unless twelve consecutive months have passed during which the individual is not a recipient of AFDC. If income from a recurring source resulted in suspension or termination due to an extra paycheck, the month of ineligibility does not interrupt the accumulation of consecutive months of the $30 plus one-third disregard, nor does it count as one of the consecutive months.</P>

            <P>(iii) The applicable earned income disregards in paragraphs (i) (B) and (C) and (ii)(B) of this paragraph do not <PRTPAGE P="72"/>apply to the earned income of the individual for the month in which one of the following conditions apply to him:</P>
            <P>(A) An individual terminated his employment or reduced his earned income without good cause (as specified in the State plan) within the period of 30 days preceding such month;</P>
            <P>(B) An individual refused without good cause (as specified in the State plan) within the period of 30 days preceding such month to accept employment in which he is able to engage which is offered through the public employment offices of the State, or is otherwise offered by an employer if the offer of such employer is determined by the State or local agency administering the State plan, after notification by him, to be a bona fide offer of employment;</P>
            <P>(C) An individual failed without good cause (as specified in the State plan) to make a timely report (as defined in § 233.37(c)) of that income; or</P>
            <P>(D) The individual voluntarily requests assistance to be terminated for the primary purpose of avoiding receiving the $30 and one-third disregard for four consecutive months.</P>
            <P>(iv) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(v) The treatment of earned income and expenses under JOBS is as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) For earned income from regular employment or on-the-job training, as described at § 250.61, the disregards in paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (a)(11)(ii)(B) shall apply.</P>
            <P>(B) For earned income from a job under the work supplementation component, as described at § 250.62, the disregards in paragraphs (a)(11)(i) and (a)(11)(ii)(B) shall apply unless the State IV-A agency in its State JOBS plan, has elected to provide otherwise under § 250.62(j) and § 250.62(k).</P>
            <P>(C) For all activities under JOBS and self-initiated education and training in non-JOBS areas, advance payment or reimbursement to the individual for child care, transportation, work-related expenses, or work-related supportive services is disregarded.</P>

            <P>(vii) At State option, disregard all or part of the monthly earned income of any dependent child applying for AFDC, if the child is a full-time student, and that income has been disregarded for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(viii) Disregard as income the amount of any earned income tax credit payments received by an applicant or recipient. Disregard as resources, in the month of receipt and the following month, the amount of any earned income tax credit payments received by an applicant or recipient. “Earned income tax credit payments” include: Any advance earned income tax credit payment made to a family by an employer and any earned income tax credit payment made as a refund of Federal income taxes.</P>

            <P>(A) The State may not recoup any overpayment previously made to a recipient:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Unless the recipient has income or resources exclusive of the current assistance payment currently available in the amount by which the agency proposes to reduce payments: except that,</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Where such overpayments were occassioned or caused by the recipient's willful withholding of information concerning his income, resources or other circumstances which may affect the amount of payment, the State may recoup prior overpayments from current assistance grants irrespective of current income or resources.<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
            </P>

            <P>(B) Withholding of information which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section includes the following:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Willful misstatements (either oral or written) made by a recipient in response to oral or written questions from the State agency concerning the recipient's income, resources or other circumstances which may affect the amount of payment. Such misstatements may include understatements of amounts of income or resources and omission of an entire category of income or resources;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A willful failure by the recipient to report changes in income, resources or other circumstances which may affect the amount of payment, if the State agency has clearly notified the recipient of an obligation to report such changes. The recipient shall be given such notification periodically at times (not less frequently than semi-annually) and by methods which the State agency determines will effectively bring such reporting requirements to the recipient's attention:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A willfull failure by the recipient (<E T="03">i</E>) to report receipt of a payment which the recipient knew represented an erroneous overpayment, or (<E T="03">ii</E>) to notify the State agency of receipt of a check which exceeded the prior check by at least the amount which the State agency had previously notified the recipient (pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section) might represent an overpayment and constitute a sum to which the recipient would not be entitled. In making a determination pursuant to this paragraph (a)(12)(i)(B)(<E T="03">3</E>), all relevant circumstances including the amount by which the erroneous payment exceeded the previous payment shall be considered.</P>

            <P>(C) Each periodic notification under paragraph (a)(12)(i)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section shall:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Include a reminder that it is the recipient's continuing obligation to furnish to the State agency accurate and timely information concerning changes in income, resources, or other circumstances which may affect the amount of payment, within a reasonable specified period after such change. The recipient may also be notified that a failure to so notify the State agency within the designated time period may constitute a willful withholding of such information and permit the State agency to recover any overpayment occasioned or caused by the willful withholding;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Specifically and comprehensibly in simple phraseology indicate the type of information to be disclosed by the recipient. Examples shall be furnished of the most frequent types of newly acquired income or resources (e.g., inheritance, wages from a part-time job);</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Require that, if there is any doubt whether a particular change in circumstances constitutes such reportable information, the recipient contact the State agency or a designated representative thereof within a reasonable specified period of time after such change in circumstances;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If the State plan provides for recoupment in the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(12)(i)(B)(<E T="03">3</E>)(<E T="03">ii</E>) of this section, notify the recipient that if the check received exceeds the prior check by a specified amount (which amount may not be less than that which a reasonable man should have known was erroneous), this increased check may constitute a sum to which the recipient is not entitled. In such instances, the notification may require that the recipient notify the State agency or a designated representative thereof prior to the negotiation of such check, so that corrective action may be taken; the State agency shall respond to such notification within 24 hours. The recipient may also be notified that a failure to so notify the State agency within the designated time period may constitute a willful withholding of such information and permit the State agency to recover such overpayment.</P>
            <P>(D) The State agency shall require periodic formal acknowledgement by recipients (on a form utilized for this purpose) that the reporting obligations of this paragraph had been brought to the recipient's attention and that they were understood.</P>

            <P>(E) Any recoupment of overpayments made under circumstances other than those specified in paragraph (a)(12)(i)(B) of this section shall be limited to overpayments made during the <PRTPAGE P="74"/>12 months preceding the month in which the overpayment was discovered.</P>

            <P>(F) Any recoupment of overpayments permitted by paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section may be made from available income and resources (including disregarded, set-aside or reserved items) or from current assistance payment or from both. If recoupments are made from current assistance payments, the State shall, on a case-by-case basis, limit the proportion of such payments that may be deducted in each case, so as not to cause undue hardship to recipients.</P>
            <P>(G) The plan may provide for recoupment in all situations specified herein, or only in certain of the circumstances specified herein, and for waiver of the overpayment where the cost of collection would exceed the amount of the overpayment.</P>
            <P>(H) Election by the State not to recoup overpayments shall not waive the provisions of §§ 205.40, and 205.41, or any other quality control requirement.</P>
            <P>(ii) Prompt correction of underpayments to current recipients, resulting from administrative error where the State plan provides for recoupment of overpayments. Under this requirement:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Retroactive corrective payment shall be made only for the 12 months preceding the month in which the underpayment is discovered;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) For purposes of determining continued eligibility and amount of assistance, such retroactive corrective payments shall not be considered as income or as a resource in the month paid nor in the next following month; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) No retroactive payment need be made where the administrative cost would exceed the amount of the payment.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Recovery of overpayments and correction of underpayments for AFDC.</E> (i) Specify uniform Statewide policies for recovery of overpayments of assistance, including overpayments resulting from assistance paid pending hearing decisions. Overpayment means a financial assistance payment received by or for an assistance unit for the payment month which exceeds the amount for which that unit was eligible. (The agency may deny assistance for the corresponding payment month rather than recover if the assistance unit was ineligible for the budget month, the State becomes aware of the ineligibility when the monthly report is submitted, the recipient accurately reported the budget month's income and other circumstances, and the assistance unit will be eligible for the following payment month.)</P>
            <P>(A) The State must take all reasonable steps necessary to promptly correct any overpayment, except that, as set forth in the plan, a State may waive any overpayment which occurred because receipt of an earned income tax credit payment by a family during the period January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1990, caused ineligibility under the 185 percent gross income limitation in paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Any recovery of an overpayment to a current assistance unit, including a current assistance unit or recipient whose overpayment occurred during a prior period of eligibility, must be recovered through repayment (in part or in full) by the individual responsible for the overpayment or recovering the overpayment by reducing the amount of any aid payable to the assistance unit of which he or she is a member, or both.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If recovery is made from the grant, such recovery shall result in the assistance unit retaining, for any payment month, from the combined aid, income and liquid resources, (without application of section 402(a)(8) of the Act) not less than 90 percent of the amount payable under the State plan to a family of the same composition with no other income. Where a State chooses to recover at a rate less than the maximum, it must recover promptly.</P>
            <P>(B) The State shall recover an overpayment from (<E T="03">1</E>) the assistance unit which was overpaid, or (<E T="03">2</E>) any assistance unit of which a member of the overpaid assistance unit has subsequently become a member, or (<E T="03">3</E>) any individual members of the overpaid assistance unit whether or not currently a recipient. If the State recovers from individuals who are no longer recipients, or from recipients who refuse to repay the overpayment from their income and resources, recovery shall be made by appropriate action under <PRTPAGE P="75"/>State law against the income or resources of those individuals.</P>
            <P>(C) If through recovery, the amount payable to the assistance unit is reduced to zero, members of the assistance unit are still considered recipients of AFDC.</P>
            <P>(D) In cases which have both an underpayment and an overpayment, the State may offset one against the other in correcting the payment.</P>
            <P>(E) Prompt recovery of an overpayment: A State must take one of the following three actions by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the overpayment is first identified:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Recover the overpayment, (<E T="03">2</E>) initiate action to locate and/or recover the overpayment from a former recipient, or (<E T="03">3</E>) execute a monthly recovery agreement from a current recipient's grant or income/resources.</P>
            <P>(ii) Specify uniform Statewide policies for prompt correction of any underpayments to current recipients and those who would be a current recipient if the error causing the underpayment had not occurred. Underpayment means a financial assistance payment received by or for an assistance unit for the payment month which is less than the amount for which the assistance unit was eligible, or failure by the State to issue a financial assistance payment for the payment month to an eligible assistance unit if such payment should have been issued. Under this requirement, for purposes of determining continued eligibility and amount of assistance, such retroactive corrective payments shall not be considered as income, or as a resource in the month paid nor in the next following month.</P>
            <P>(iii) Paragraph (a)(13) of this section is effective for incorrect payments which are identified subsequent to September 30, 1981.</P>
            <P>(iv) In locating former recipients who have outstanding overpayments the State should use appropriate data sources such as State unemployment insurance files, State Department of Revenue information from tax returns, State automobile registration, Bendex, and other files relating to current or former recipients.</P>
            <P>(v) The State must maintain information on the individual and total number and amount of overpayments identified and their disposition for current and former recipients.</P>
            <P>(vi) The State may elect not to attempt recovery of an overpayment from an individual no longer receiving aid where the overpayment amount is less than $35. Where the overpayment amount owed by an individual no longer receiving aid is $35 or more, the State can determine when it is no longer cost-effective to continue overpayment recovery efforts, provided it has made reasonable efforts to recover the overpayment from the individual. Reasonable efforts must include notification of the amount of and reason for the overpayment and that repayment is required. States must also maintain information regarding uncollected overpayments as provided under paragraph (a)(13)(v) of this section, to enable the State to recover those overpayments if the individual subsequently becomes a recipient. In cases involving fraud, States must make every effort to recover the overpayment, regardless of the amount.</P>
            <P>(14) For Medicaid eligibility only, beginning October 1, 1998, pursuant to section 402(a)(37) of the Act, an assistance unit will be deemed to be receiving AFDC, but only for the purposes of this paragraph, for a period of nine months after the last month the family actually received aid if the loss of AFDC eligibility was solely because a member of the unit was no longer eligible due to the 4 and 12 month time limitations to have the $30 and one-third or the $30 disregard in paragraph (a)(11)(ii)(B) applied to his or her earned income. At State option, an additional period of Medicaid coverage for up to six months may be provided when the assistance unit would be eligible during such additional period to receive AFDC if the $30 and one-third or the $30 disregards were applied to the assistance unit's earned income.</P>
            <P>(15) For Medicaid eligibility only, pursuant to section 406(h) of the Act:</P>

            <P>(i) Each dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is living (including the eligible spouse of such relative pursuant to section 237.50(b) of this chapter) who becomes ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly because of the initiation of or an increase in the <PRTPAGE P="76"/>amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV-D will be deemed to be receiving AFDC, but only for purposes of this paragraph (a)(15), for a period of four consecutive calendar months beginning with the first month of AFDC ineligibility. To be eligible for extended Medicaid coverage pursuant to this paragraph (a)(15), each dependent child and relative must meet the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(A) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984; and</P>
            <P>(B) The individual must have received AFDC in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which the individual becomes ineligible for AFDC; and</P>
            <P>(C) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly as a result of the initiation of or an increase in the amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV-D.</P>
            <P>(ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(15)(ii)(B) of this section, individuals who are eligible for extended Medicaid lose this coverage if they move to another State during the 4-month period. However, if they move back to and reestablish residence in the State in which they have extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the months remaining in the 4-month period in which they are residents of the State.</P>
            <P>(B) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to non-residents, the State may continue to provide the 4-month extended benefits to individuals who have moved to another State.</P>
            <P>(iii) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section:</P>
            <P>(A) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility when it actively causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even if the support collection must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other independent factors, alone or in combination with each other, might simultaneously cause ineligibility; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility must result when the change in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other circumstances and the other changes in income or circumstances cannot alone or in combination result in termination without the change in support.</P>
            <P>(B) In cases of increases in the amounts of both the support collections and earned income, eligibility under this section does not preclude eligibility under paragraph (a)(14) of this section or section 1925 of the Social Security Act (which was added by section 303(a) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 139r-6)). Extended periods result from both an increase in the amount of the support collection and from an increase in earned income must run concurrently.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal financial participation; General.</E> (1) Federal participation will be available in financial assistance payments made on the basis that (after application of policies governing the allowable reserve, disregard or setting aside of income and resources), all income of the needy individual, together with the assistance payment, do not exceed the State's defined standard of assistance, and available resources of the needy individuals do not exceed the limits under the State plan.</P>
            <P>(2) Federal participation is available within the maximums specified in the Federal law, when the payments do not exceed the amount determined to be needed under the statewide standard, and are made in accordance with the State method for determining the amount of the payments, as specified in § 233.31 for AFDC and in §§ 233.24 and 233.25 for OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD.</P>

            <P>(3) Federal participation is available in financial assistance payments made on the basis of the need of the individual. This basis may include consideration of needy persons living in the same home with the recipient when such other persons are within the State's policy as essential to his well-being. Persons living in the home who are “essential to the well-being of the recipient,” as specified in the State <PRTPAGE P="77"/>plan, will govern as the basis for Federal participation (see Guides and Recommendations). When the State includes persons living outside the home or persons not in need, Federal participation is not available for that portion of financial assistance payments attributable to such persons, and the State's claims must, therefore, identify the amounts of any such nonmatchable payments.</P>
            <P>(4) For all assistance programs except AFDC, Federal participation is available for supplemental payments in the retrospective budgeting system.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal financial participation in vendor payments for home repairs.</E> With respect to expenditures made after December 31, 1967, expenditures to a maximum of $500 are subject to Federal financial participation at 50 percent for repairing the home owned by an individual who is receiving aid or assistance (other than Medical Assistance for the Aged) under a State plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD if:</P>
            <P>(1) Prior to making the expenditures the agency determined that: (i) The home is so defective that continued occupancy is unwarranted; (ii) unless repairs are made the recipient would need to move to rental quarters; and (iii) the rental cost of quarters for the recipient (including the spouse living with him in such home and any other individual whose needs were considered in determining the recipient's need) would exceed (over a period of 2 years) the repair costs needed to make such home habitable together with other costs attributable to continued occupancy of such home.</P>
            <P>(2) No expenditures for repair of such home were made previously pursuant to a determination as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This does not preclude more than one payment made at the time repairs are made pursuant to the determination, e.g., separate payments to the roofer, the electrician, and the plumber.</P>
            <P>(3) Expenditures for home repairs are authorized in writing by a responsible agency person, records show the eligible person in whose behalf the home repair expenditure was made, and there is sufficient evidence that the home repair was performed.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for State plans.</E> A State plan for OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD shall specify if assistance payments shall be computed using a prospective budgeting system or a retrospective budgeting system. A State electing retrospective budgeting shall specify which options it selects and the State plan shall state that it shall meet the requirements in §§ 233.21 through 233.29. Budgeting methods for AFDC are described in §§ 233.31 through 233.37.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to §§ 233.21 through 233.29:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Prospective budgeting</E> means that the agency shall compute the amount of assistance for a payment month based on its best estimate of income and circumstances which will exist in that month. This estimate shall be based on the agency's reasonable expectation and knowledge of current, past or future circumstances.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Retrospective budgeting</E> means that the agency shall compute the amount of assistance for a payment month based on actual income or circumstances which existed in a previous month, the “budget month”.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Budget month</E> means the fiscal or calendar month from which the agency shall use income or circumstances of the family to compute the amount of assistance.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Payment month</E> means the fiscal or calendar month for which an agency shall pay assistance. Payment is based upon income or circumstances in the budget month. In prospective budgeting, the budget month and the payment month are the same. In retrospective budgeting, the payment month follows the budget month and the payment month shall begin within <PRTPAGE P="78"/>32 days after the end of the budget month.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Make an assistance payment.</E> In the context of retrospective budgeting, to make an assistance payment means that the check shall be deposited in the U.S. mail, hand delivered to the recipient, or deposited with an intermediary organization, such as a bank.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Supplemental payment.</E> In the context of retrospective budgeting, a supplemental payment is a payment which maintains a family during the time it takes for the monthly assistance payment to reflect a change in circumstances or income.</P>

            <P>(b) In these subsequent months, other factors of need which affect the amount of the assistance payment may also be based on circumstances in the corresponding budget month, or they may be based on circumstances in the payment month.<PRTPAGE P="79"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) For the first month in which retrospective budgeting is used, a State shall not consider income received by the recipient before the date of application.

            <P>(a) Under retrospective budgeting, there are three options for determining eligibility. The State plan shall specify that eligibility, following the initial one or two months under § 233.24, shall be determined by one of the following methods:</P>
            <P>(1) A State may consider all factors, including income retrospectively, i.e., only from the budget month. For example, if a change in circumstances occurs which affects eligibility, e.g., deprivation ceases, the change may be reported at the end of the budget month and assistance shall be terminated for the corresponding payment month. Thus, even if the agency could have terminated assistance earlier than the corresponding payment month, it shall not do so under retrospective determination of eligibility.</P>
            <P>(2) A State may consider all factors, including income, prospectively. For example, if deprivation ceases, and the family becomes ineligible, the agency shall immediately take steps to terminate assistance.</P>
            <P>(3) A State may use a combination of the options in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section by considering factors related to earned and unearned income retrospectively and all other factors prospectively. For example, if a change in income makes the family ineligible, the agency shall wait until the corresponding payment month to terminate assistance. On the other hand, if a change of circumstances other than income makes the family ineligible, the agency shall immediately take steps to terminate assistance.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">What happens if a completed monthly report is received on time.</E> When the agency receives a completed monthly report by the date specified in § 233.28 it shall process the payment. The agency shall notify the recipient of any changes from the prior payment and the basis for its determinations. This notice must meet the requirements of § 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) of this chapter on adequate notice if the payment is being reduced or assistance is being terminated. This notice must be received by the recipient no later than his or her resulting payment or in lieu of the payment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">What happens if the completed monthly report is received before the extension deadline.</E> (1) If the completed monthly report is not received by the date specified in § 233.28, the agency shall send a notice to the recipient. This notice shall inform him or her that the monthly report is overdue or is not complete and that he or she has at least 10 additional days to file. It must inform the recipient that termination may result if that is the agency's policy, if the report is not filed within the extension period. This notice must reach the recipient at least 10 days before the expected payment. However, in States in which the date specified in § 233.28 is within 10 days of the expected payment date, the notice must reach the recipient on or before the expected payment date.</P>
            <P>(2) When the report is received within the extension period, the agency may delay payment to the recipient, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) In a State that pays within 25 days of the budget month the payment may be delayed 10 days;</P>
            <P>(ii) In a State that pays within 25 to 45 days of the budget month, the payment may not be delayed beyond the 45th day.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">How a recipient may delay an adverse action based on a monthly report.</E> If a recipient's assistance is reduced or terminated based on information in the monthly report, and he or she requests a fair hearing within 10 days, the assistance payment shall be reinstated immediately at the previous month's level pending the hearing decision. The payment shall be made effective from the date assistance was reduced or terminated.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Retrospective budgeting</E> means that the agency shall compute the amount of assistance for a payment month based on actual income or circumstances which existed in a previous month, the “budget month.”</P>

            <P>Definition: <E T="03">Sponsor</E> is any person who, or any public or private agency or organization that, executed an affidavit(s) of support or similar agreement on behalf of an alien (who is not the child of the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse) as a condition of the alien's entry into the United States. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply only to aliens who are sponsored by individuals and who filed applications for the first time after September 30, 1981. Paragraphs (e) and (f) apply only to aliens sponsored by public or private agencies or organizations with respect to periods after October 1, 1984. A State plan under title IV-A of the Act shall provide that:</P>
            <P>(a) For a period of three years following entry for permanent residence into the United States, a sponsored alien who is not exempt under paragraph (g) of this section, shall provide the State agency with any information and documentation necessary to determine the income and resources of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse (if applicable and if living with the sponsor) that can be deemed available to the alien, and obtain any cooperation necessary from the sponsor.</P>
            <P>(b) The income and resources of a sponsor and the sponsor's spouse shall be deemed to be the unearned income and resources of an alien for three years following the alien's entry into the United States:</P>
            <P>(1) Monthly income deemed available to the alien from the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse not receiving AFDC or SSI shall be:</P>

            <P>(i) The total monthly unearned and earned income of the sponsor and sponsor's spouse reduced by 20 percent (not to exceed $175) of the total of any amounts received by them in the month as wages or salary or as net earnings from self-employment.<PRTPAGE P="86"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The amount described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section reduced by:</P>
            <P>(A) The cash needs standard under the plan in the alien's State of residence for a family of the same size and composition as the sponsor and those other people living in the same household as the sponsor who are or could be claimed by the sponsor as dependents to determine his or her Federal personal income tax liability but whose needs are not taken into account in making a determination under § 233.20 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(B) Any amounts actually paid by the sponsor or sponsor's spouse to people not living in the household who are or could be claimed by them as dependents to determine their Federal personal income tax liability; and</P>
            <P>(C) Actual payments of alimony or child support, with respect to individuals not living in the household.</P>
            <P>(2) Monthly resources deemed available to the alien from the sponsor and sponsor's spouse shall be the total amount of their resources determined as if they were applying for AFDC in the alien's State of residence, less $1500.</P>
            <P>(c) In any case where a person is the sponsor of two or more aliens, the income and resources of the sponsor and sponsor's spouse, to the extent they would be deemed the income and resources of any one of the aliens under the provisions of this section, shall be divided equally among the sponsored aliens.</P>
            <P>(d) Income and resources which are deemed to a sponsored alien shall not be considered in determining the need of other unsponsored members of the alien's family except to the extent the income or resources are actually available.</P>
            <P>(e) For a period of three years following entry for permanent residence into the United States, any alien who is not exempt under paragraph (g) of this section and has been sponsored by a public or private agency or organization, shall be ineligible for assistance unless the State agency determines (in accordance with paragraph (f)) that the sponsor no longer exists or has become unable to meet the alien's needs.</P>
            <P>(f) The State plan shall set forth the criteria the State agency will use in determining whether an agency or organization no longer exists or is unable to meet the alien's needs and the documentation the agency will require of the alien in making such determination. The sponsored alien shall provide the State agency with any information and documentation necessary for such determination and obtain any cooperation necessary from the sponsor.</P>
            <P>(g) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any alien who is:</P>
            <P>(1) Admitted as a conditional entrant refugee to the United States as a result of the application, of the provisions of section 203(a)(7) (in effect prior to April 1, 1980) of the Immigration and Nationality Act;</P>

            <P>(c) An overpayment for which the alien or the sponsor and the alien are liable (as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) shall be repaid to the State or recovered in accordance with § 233.20(a)(13). If the agency is unable to recover the overpayment through this method, funds to reimburse the agency for the overpayment shall be withheld from future payments to which the alien or the alien and the individual sponsor are entitled under:</P>

            <P>(i) No examination is necessary when both eyes are missing.</P>
            <P>(ii) Where an initial eye examination or re-examination is necessary, the physician or optometrist conducting such examination will submit to the State agency a report thereof, on such forms and in such manner, as may be prescribed for such purpose. A determination whether the individual meets the State's definition of blindness under the State plan will be based upon a review of such eye examination report as provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and other information or additional examination reports as the State deems necessary.</P>
            <P>(3) Provide that each initial eye examination report and any subsequent re-examination report will be reviewed by a State reviewing physician skilled in the diseases of the eye (e.g., an ophthalmologist or an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist). Such physician is responsible for making the agency's decision that the applicant or recipient does or does not meet the State's definition of blindness, and for determining if and when reexaminations are necessary in periodic reviews of eligibility, as required in § 206.10(a)(9)(iii) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(1) Contain a definition of permanently and totally disabled, showing that:</P>
            <P>(i) “Permanently” is related to the duration of the impairment or combination of impairments; and</P>
            <P>(ii) “Totally” is related to the degree of disability.
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <FP>The following definition is recommended:</FP>

              <P>“Permanently and totally disabled” means that the individual has some permanent physical or mental impairment, disease, or loss, or combination thereof, this substantially precludes him from engaging in useful occupations within his competence, such as holding a job.
              </P>
              <FP>Under this definition:</FP>
              <P>“Permanently” refers to a condition which is not likely to improve or which will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual; it may be a condition which is not likely to respond to any known therapeutic procedures, or a condition which is likely to remain static or to become worse unless certain therapeutic measures are carried out, where treatment is unavailable, inadvisable, or is refused by the individual on a reasonable basis; “permanently” does not rule out the possibility of vocational rehabilitation or even possible recovery in light of future medical advances or changed prognosis; in this sense the term refers to a condition which continues indefinitely, as distinct from one which is temporary or transient;</P>
              <P>“Totally” involves considerations in addition to those verified through the medical findings, such as age, training, skills, and work experience, and the probable functioning of the individual in his particular situation in light of his impairment; an individual's disability would usually be tested in relation to ability to engage in remunerative employment; the ability to keep house or to care for others would be the appropriate test for (and only for) individuals, such as housewives, who were engaged in this occupation prior to the disability and do not have a history of gainful employment; eligibility may continue, even after a period of rehabilitation and readjustment, if the individual's work capacity is still very considerably limited (in comparison with that of a normal person) in terms of such factors as the speed with which he can work, the amount he can produce in a given period of time, and the number of hours he is able to work.</P>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <P>(2) Provide for the review of each medical report and social history by technically competent persons—not less than a physician and a social worker qualified by professional training and pertinent experience—acting cooperatively, who are responsible for the agency's decision that the applicant does or does not meet the State's definition of permanent and total disability. Under this requirement:</P>
            <P>(i) The medical report must include a substantiated diagnosis, based either on existing medical evidence or upon current medical examination;</P>
            <P>(ii) The social history must contain sufficient information to make it possible to relate the medical findings to the activities of the “useful occupation” and to determine whether the individual is totally disabled, and</P>
            <P>(iii) The review physician is responsible for setting dates for reexamination; the review team is responsible for reviewing reexamination reports in conjunction with the social data to determine whether disabled recipients whose health condition may improve continue to meet the State's definition of permanent and total disability.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Factors specific to AFDC.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">State plan requirements.</E> A State plan under title IV-A of the Social Security Act shall provide that:</P>
            <P>(1) The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, or (if the State plan includes such cases) the unemployment of his or her parent who is the principal earner will be made only in relation to the child's natural or adoptive parent, or in relation to the child's stepparent who is married, under State law, to the child's natural or adoptive parent and is legally obligated to support the child under State law of general applicability which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the same extent that natural or adoptive parents are required to support their children. Under this requirement, the inclusion in the family, or the presence in the home, of a “substitute parent” or “man-in-the-house” or any individual other than one described in this paragraph is not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming the availability of income by the State; and</P>
            <P>(2) Where it has reason to believe that a child receiving aid is in an unsuitable environment because of known or suspected instances of physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent treatment or maltreatment of such child, under circumstances which indicate the child's health or welfare is threatened, the State or local agency will:</P>
            <P>(i) Bring such condition to the attention of a court, law-enforcement agency, or other appropriate agency in the State, providing whatever data it has with respect to the situation;</P>
            <P>(ii) In reporting such conditions, use the same criteria as are used in the State for all other parents and children; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Cooperate with the court or other agency in planning and implementing action in the best interest of the child.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Conditions for plan approval.</E> (1) A child may not be denied AFDC either initially or subsequently “because of the conditions of the home in which the child resides”, or because the home is considered “unsuitable”, unless “provision is otherwise made pursuant to a State statute for adequate care and assistance with respect to such child”. (Section 404(b) of the Social Security Act.)</P>
            <P>(2) An otherwise eligible child who is under the age of 18 years may not be denied AFDC, regardless of whether she attends school (unless she is required to participate in the JOBS program pursuant to § 250.30 and she is assigned to educational activities) or makes satisfactory grades.</P>
            <P>(3) A state may elect to include in its AFDC program children age 18 who are full-time students in a secondary school, or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical training, and who may reasonably be expected to complete the program before reaching age 19.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) A child may not be denied AFDC either initially or subsequently because a parent or other caretaker relative fails to cooperate with the child support agency in performing any of the activities needed to:</P>
            <P>(A) Establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock; or</P>
            <P>(B) Obtain support from a person having a legal duty to support the child.</P>
            <P>(ii) Any parent or caretaker relative who fails to so cooperate shall be treated in accordance with § 232.12 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(5) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(6) An otherwise eligible child may not be denied AFDC if a parent is mentally or physically incapacitated as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal financial participation.</E> (1) Federal financial participation under title IV-A of the Social Security Act in payments with respect to a “dependent child,” as defined in section 406(a) of the Act, is available within the following interpretations:<PRTPAGE P="92"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Needy child deprived by reason of.</E> The phrase “needy child * * * deprived * * * by reason of” requires that both need and deprivation of parental support or care exist in the individual case. The phrase encompasses the situation of any child who is in need and otherwise eligible, and whose parent—father or mother—either has died, has a physical or mental incapacity, or is continually absent from the home. This interpretation is equally applicable whether the parent was the chief bread winner or devoted himself or herself primarily to the care of the child, and whether or not the parents were married to each other. The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental support or care is made in relation to the child's natural parent or, as appropriate, the adoptive parent or stepparent described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Death of a parent.</E> If either parent of a child is deceased, the child is deprived of parental support or care, and may, if he is in need and otherwise eligible, be included within the scope of the program.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Continued absence of the parent from the home.</E> Continued absence of the parent from the home constitutes the reason for deprivation of parental support or care when the parent is out of the home, the nature of the absence is such as either to interrupt or to terminate the parent's functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care, or guidance for the child, and the known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes counting on the parent's performance of the function of planning for the present support or care of the child. If these conditions exist, the parent may be absent for any reason, and may have left only recently or some time previously; except that a parent whose absence is occasioned solely by reason of the performance of active duty in the uniformed services of the United States (as defined in section 101(3) of Title 37, United States code) is not considered absent from the home. A parent who is a convicted offender but is permitted to live at home while serving a court-imposed sentence by performing unpaid public work or unpaid community service during the workday is considered absent from the home.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">“Physical or mental incapacity”.</E> “Physical or mental incapacity” of a parent shall be deemed to exist when one parent has a physical or mental defect, illness, or impairment. The incapacity shall be supported by competent medical testimony and must be of such a debilitating nature as to reduce substantially or eliminate the parent's ability to support or care for the otherwise eligible child and be expected to last for a period of at least 30 days. In making the determination of ability to support, the agency shall take into account the limited employment opportunities of handicapped individuals.</P>
            <FP>A finding of eligibility for OASDI or SSI benefits, based on disability or blindness is acceptable proof of incapacity for AFDC purposes.</FP>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">“Living with [a specified relative] in a place of residence maintained * * * as his * * * own home”.</E> (A) A child may be considered to meet the requirement of living with one of the relatives specified in the Act if his home is with a parent or a person in one of the following groups:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Any blood relative, including those of half-blood, and including first cousins, nephews, or nieces, and persons of preceding generations as denoted by prefixes of grand, great, or great-great.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, and stepsister.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Person who legally adopt a child or his parent as well as the natural and other legally adopted children of such persons, and other relatives of the adoptive parents in accordance with State law.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Spouses of any persons named in the above groups even after the marriage is terminated by death or divorce.</P>

            <P>(B) A home is the family setting maintained or in process of being established, as evidenced by assumption and continuation of responsibility for day to day care of the child by the relative with whom the child is living. A home exists so long as the relative exercises responsibility for the care and control of the child, even though either the child or the relative is temporarily <PRTPAGE P="93"/>absent from the customary family setting. Within this interpretation, the child is considered to be “living with” his relative even though:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) He is under the jurisdiction of the court (e.g., receiving probation services or protective supervision); or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Legal custody is held by an agency that does not have physical possession of the child.</P>
            <P>(2) Federal financial participation is available in:</P>
            <P>(i) Initial payments made on behalf of a child who goes to live with a relative specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Social Security Act within 30 days of the receipt of the first payment, provided payments are not made for concurrent period for the same child in the home of another relative or as foster care under title IV-E;</P>
            <P>(ii) Payments made for the entire month in the course of which a child leaves the home of a specified relative, provided payments are not made for a concurrent period for the same child in the home of another relative or as foster care under title IV-E; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Payments made to persons acting for relatives specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Act in emergency situations that deprive the child of the care of the relative through whom he has been receiving aid, for a temporary period necessary to make and carry out plans for the child's continuing care and support.</P>
            <P>(iv) At State option, (A) payments with respect to a pregnant woman with no other children receiving assistance, and additionally, at State option, (B) payments for the purpose of meeting special needs occasioned by or resulting from pregnancy both for the pregnant woman with no other children as well as for the pregnant woman receiving AFDC. However, for both paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) (A) and (B) of this section it must be medically verified that the child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made or within the three-month period following such month of payment, and who, if such child had been born and was living with her in the month of payment, would be eligible for aid to families with dependent children. Federal financial participation is not available to meet the needs of the unborn child. (Refer to Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR 435.115 for Medicaid coverage of pregnant women.)</P>
            <P>(3) Federal financial participation (at the 50 percent rate) is available in any expenses incurred in establishing eligibility for AFDC, including expenses incident to obtaining necessary information to determine the existence of incapacity of a parent or pregnancy of a mother.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Dependent children of unemployed parents.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Requirements for State Plans. If a State wishes to provide AFDC for children of unemployed parents, the State plan under title IV-A of the Social Security Act must:</P>
            <P>(1) Include a definition of an unemployed parent who is the principal earner which shall apply only to families determined to be needy in accordance with the provisions in § 233.20. Such definition must include any such parent who:</P>
            <P>(i) Is employed less than 100 hours a month; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Exceeds that standard for a particular month, if the work is intermittent and the excess is of a temporary nature as evidenced by the fact that he or she was under the 100-hour standard for the prior 2 months and is expected to be under the standard during the next month; except that at the option of the State, such definition need not include a principal earner who is unemployed because of participation in a labor dispute (other than a strike) or by reason of conduct or circumstances which result or would result in disqualification for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.</P>

            <P>(2) Include a definition of a dependent child which shall include any child of an unemployed parent (as defined by the State pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section) who would be, except for the fact that his parent is not dead, <PRTPAGE P="94"/>absent from the home, or incapacitated, a dependent child under the State's plan approved under section 402 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(3) Provide for payment of aid with respect to any dependent child (as defined by the State pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2) of this section) when the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) (i), (ii), (iii), and (vii) of this section are met:</P>
            <P>(i) His or her parent who is the principal earner has been unemployed for at least 30 days prior to the receipt of such aid.</P>
            <P>(ii) Such parent has not without good cause, within such 30-day period prior to the receipt of such aid, refused a bona fide offer of employment or training for employment. Before it is determined that such parent has refused a bona fide offer of employment or training for employment without good cause, the agency must make a determination that such an offer was actually made. (In the case of offers of employment made through the public employment or manpower agencies, the determination as to whether the offer was bona fide, or whether there was good cause to refuse it, will be made by that office or agency.) The parent must be given an opportunity to explain why such offer was not accepted. Questions with respect to the following factors must be resolved:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) That there was a definite offer of employment at wages meeting any applicable minimum wage requirements and which are customary for such work in the community;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Any questions as to the parent's inability to engage in such employment for physical reasons or because he has no way to get to or from the particular job; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Any questions of working conditions, such as risks to health, safety, or lack of worker's compensation protection.</P>
            <P>(iii) Such parent (<E T="03">a</E>) has six or more quarters of work (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section), within any 13-calendar-quarter period ending within 1 year prior to the application for such aid, or (<E T="03">b</E>) within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, or was qualified under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section) for such compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.</P>
            <P>(iv) A “quarter of work” with respect to any individual means a period (of 3 consecutive calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31) in which he or she received earned income of not less than $50 (or which is a “quarter of coverage” as defined in section 213(a)(2) of the Act), or in which he or she participated in a community work experience program under section 409 of the Act or the work incentive program established under title IV-C of the Act.</P>
            <P>(v) An individual shall be deemed “qualified” for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law if he would have been eligible to receive such benefits upon filing application, or he performed work not covered by such law which, if it had been covered, would (together with any covered work he performed) have made him eligible to receive such benefits upon filing application.</P>
            <P>(vi)(A) The “parent who is the principal earner” means, in the case of any child, whichever parent, in a home in which both parents of such child are living, earned the greater amount of income in the 24-month period the last month of which immediately precedes the month in which an application is filed for aid under this part on the basis of the unemployment of a parent. If the State cannot secure primary evidence of earnings for this period, the State shall designate the principal earner, using the best evidence available. The earnings of each parent are considered in determining the principal earner regardless of when their relationship began. The principal earner so defined remains the principal earner for each consecutive month for which the family receives such aid on the basis of such application. This requirement applies to both new applicants and current AFDC unemployed parent families who were eligible and receiving aid prior to October 1, 1981.</P>

            <P>(B) If both parents earned an identical amount of income (or earned no income) in such 24-month period, the <PRTPAGE P="95"/>State shall designate which parent shall be the principal earner.</P>
            <P>(vii) The parent who is the principal earner (unless exempt under § 240.14) has met the requirements for participation in an employment search program under part 240 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(4) Provide for entering into cooperative arrangements with the State agency responsible for administering or supervising the administration of vocational education to assure maximum utilization of available public vocational education services and facilities in the State to encourage the retraining of individuals capable of being retrained.</P>
            <P>(5) Provide for the denial of such aid to any such dependent child or the relative specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Act with whom such child is living,</P>
            <P>(i) If and for so long as such child's parent, unless exempt under § 224.20, is not currently registered for the work incentive program or if exempt under § 224.20(b)(6), is not currently registered with a public employment office in the State, except that in a State with an approved JOBS plan under § 250.20, such child's parent, unless exempt under § 250.30(b), must be currently participating (or available for participation) in a program under part 250, or, if he is exempt under § 250.30(b)(5), must be registered with a public employment office in the State, and</P>
            <P>(ii) With respect to any week for which such child's parent qualifies for unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of the State or of the United States but refuses to apply for or accept such unemployment compensation, and</P>
            <P>(iii) If the parent who is the principal earner (unless exempt under § 240.14) fails to meet the requirements for participation in a program of employment search established under part 240 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(6) Provide that within 30 days after the receipt of such aid, unemployed principal earners will be certified for participation in the Work Incentive program under part 224 or, if the State IV-A agency has an approved JOBS plan pursuant to § 250.20, will participate or apply for participation in a program under part 250 unless the program is not available in the area where the parent is living.</P>
            <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal financial participation.</E> (1) Federal financial participation is available in payments authorized in accordance with the State plan approved under section 402 of the Act as aid to families with dependent children with respect to a child.</P>
            <P>(i) Who meets the requirements of section 406(a)(2) of the Act;</P>
            <P>(ii) Who is living with any of the relatives specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Act in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his (or their) own home;</P>
            <P>(iii) Who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the fact that his or her parent who is the principal earner is employed less than 100 hours a month; or exceeds that standard for a particular month if his or her work is intermittent and the excess is of a temporary nature as evidenced by the fact that he or she was under the 100-hour standard for 2 prior months and is expected to be under the standard during the next month.</P>
            <P>(iv) Whose parent who is the principal earner (<E T="03">a</E>) has six or more quarters of work (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section) within any 13-calendar-quarter period ending within 1 year prior to the application for such aid, (<E T="03">b</E>) within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, or was qualified (under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section) for such compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law; and</P>
            <P>(v) Whose parent who is the principal earner (<E T="03">a</E>) is currently registered with the WIN program unless exempt or is registered with the public employment office in the State if exempt from WIN registration under § 224.20(b)(6) or because there is no WIN program in which he can effectively participate; and (<E T="03">b</E>) has not refused to apply for or accept unemployment compensation with respect to any week for which such child's parent qualifies for unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States.<PRTPAGE P="96"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) The State may not include in its claim for Federal financial participation payments made as aid under the plan with respect to a child who meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, where such payments were made.</P>
            <P>(i) For any part of the 30-day period specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) For such 30-day period if during that period the parent refused without good cause a bona fide offer of employment or training for employment;</P>
            <P>(iii) For any period beginning with the 31st day after receipt of aid, if and for as long as no action is taken during the period to certify the parent for participation in the Work Incentive program under part 224, or if the State IV-A agency has an approved JOBS plan pursuant to § 250.20, no action is taken during the period to undertake appropriate steps directed toward the participation of such parent in a program under part 250; and</P>
            <P>(iv) For any part of the sanction period imposed under § 240.22 (for failure to meet the requirements for participation in the employment search program).</P>

            <P>(a) Requirements for State Plans. Effective October 1, 1990 (for Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, October 1, 1992), a State plan must provide for payment of AFDC for children of unemployed parents. A State plan under title IV-A for payment of such aid must:</P>
            <P>(1) Include a definition of an unemployed parent who is the principal earner which shall apply only to families determined to be needy in accordance with the provisions in § 233.20 of this part. Such definition must have a reasonable standard for measuring unemployment and, at a minimum, include any such parent who:</P>
            <P>(i) Is employed less than 100 hours a month; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Exceeds that standard for a particular month, if the work is intermittent and the excess is of a temporary nature as evidenced by the fact that he or she was under the 100-hour standard for the prior 2 months and is expected to be under the standard during the next month; except that at the option of the State, such definition need not include a principal earner who is unemployed because of participation in a labor dispute (other than a strike) or by reason of conduct or circumstances which result or would result in disqualification for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.</P>
            <P>(2) Include a definition of a dependent child which shall include any child of an unemployed parent (as defined by the State pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section) who would be, except for the fact that his parent is not dead, absent from the home, or incapacitated, a dependent child under the State's plan approved under section 402 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(3) Provide for payment of aid with respect to any dependent child (as defined by the State pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section) when the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii), and (a)(3)(iii) of this section are met.</P>
            <P>(i) His or her parent who is the principal earner has been unemployed for at least 30 days prior to the receipt of such aid;</P>

            <P>(ii) Such parent has not without good cause, within such 30-day period prior to the receipt of such aid, refused a bona fide offer of employment or training for employment. Before it is determined that such parent has refused a bona fide offer of employment or training for employment without good cause, the agency must make a determination that such offer was actually <PRTPAGE P="97"/>made. (In the case of offers of employment made through the public employment or manpower agencies, the determination as to whether the offer was bona fide, or whether there was good cause to refuse it, shall be made by the title IV-A agency.

Questions with respect to the following factors must be resolved:</P>
            <P>(A) That there was a definite offer of employment at wages meeting any applicable minimum wage requirements and which are customary for such work in the community;</P>
            <P>(B) Any questions as to the parent's inability to engage in such employment for physical reasons or because he has no way to get to or from the particular job; and</P>

            <P>(iii) Such parent:</P>
            <P>(A) Has six or more quarters of work (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section), within any 13-calendar-quarter period ending within one year prior to the application for such aid, or</P>
            <P>(B) Within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, or was qualified under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section for such compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.</P>
            <P>(iv) A “quarter of work” with respect to any individual means a period (of 3 consecutive calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31):</P>
            <P>(A) In which an individual received earned income of not less than $50 (or which is a “quarter of coverage” as defined in section 213(a)(2) of the Social Security Act) or participated in a program under part 250 of this chapter; or</P>
            <P>(B) At State option (as specified in the plan), in one or more subdivisions of the State, in which he or she attended, full-time, an elementary school, a secondary school, or a vocational or technical training course that is designed to prepare the individual for gainful employment, or in which the individual participated in an educational or training program established under the Job Training Partnership Act, provided that an individual may qualify for no more than four quarters of work under this paragraph for purposes of the requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(C) A calendar quarter ending before October 1990 in which an individual participated in CWEP under section 409 of the Social Security Act or the WIN program established under title IV-C of the Social Security Act (as in effect for a State immediately before the effective date of that State's JOBS program).</P>
            <P>(v) An individual shall be deemed “qualified” for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law if he or she would have been eligible to receive such benefits upon filing an application, or he performed work not covered by such law, which, if it had been covered, would (together with any covered work he performed) have made him eligible to receive such benefits upon filing an application.</P>
            <P>(vi)(A) The “parent who is the principal earner” means, in the case of any child, whichever parent, in a home in which both parents of such child are living, earned the greater amount of income in the 24-month period the last month of which immediately precedes the month in which an application is filed for aid under this part on the basis of the unemployment of a parent. If the State cannot secure primary evidence of earnings for this period, the State shall designate the principal earner, using the best evidence available. The earnings of each parent are considered in determining the principal earner regardless of when their relationship began. The principal earner so defined remains the principal earner for each consecutive month for which the family receives such aid on the basis of such application. This requirement applies to both new applicants and current AFDC unemployed parent families who were eligible and receiving aid prior to October 1, 1981.</P>

            <P>(B) If both parents earned an identical amount of income (or earned no <PRTPAGE P="98"/>income) in such 24-month period, the State shall designate which parent shall be the principal earner.</P>
            <P>(4) Provide for entering into cooperative arrangements with the State agency responsible for administering or supervising the administration of vocational education to assure maximum utilization of available public vocational education services and facilities in the State to encourage the retraining of individuals capable of being retrained.</P>
            <P>(5) Provide that the needs of the child's parent(s) shall not be taken into account in determining the needs and amount of assistance of the child's family:</P>
            <P>(i) If and for so long as such child's parent(s), unless exempt under § 250.30(b) of this chapter, is not currently participating (or available for participation) in a program under part 250 of this chapter or, if they are exempt under § 250.30(b)(5) of this chapter (or because a JOBS program has not been established in the subdivision where they reside or they reside in a JOBS subdivision but there is no appropriate JOBS activity in which they can participate), are not registered with a public employment office in the State, and</P>
            <P>(ii) With respect to any week for which such child's parent qualifies for unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of the State or of the United States but refuses to apply for or accept such unemployment compensation.</P>
            <P>(6) Provide that medical assistance will be furnished under the State's approved plan under title XIX during any month in which an otherwise eligible individual is denied assistance solely by reason of the time limitation provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">State Plan Options.</E> A State plan under title IV-A may:</P>
            <P>(1) Require the principal earner or both parents to participate in an activity in the JOBS program under part 250 of this chapter, subject to the limitations and conditions of part 250 of this chapter, provided that the participation of each parent in all required activities under the JOBS program does not exceed 40 hours per week, per parent.</P>
            <P>(2) Provide cash assistance after the performance of assigned program activities by parents required to participate in an activity in the JOBS program under part 250 of this chapter (as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) so long as the State:</P>
            <P>(i) Makes assistance payments at regular intervals at least monthly,</P>
            <P>(ii) Prescribes a set of criteria which defines goals or standards for each assigned activity in the JOBS program which must be completed by the participant prior to payment, and</P>
            <P>(iii) Prior to, or concurrent with, assignment to an activity, notifies the participant of the prescribed goals or standards and that payment for a period will be withheld unless performance of each assigned activity for that period is completed.</P>
            <P>(3) Provide for a State to operate a payment after performance system under which a family is issued an assistance payment after the applicable family member has successfully completed her obligation to participate in JOBS for a specific period. If the applicable family member fails without good cause to satisfy the obligation, the State may:</P>
            <P>(i) Impose a sanction in accordance with the JOBS program rules at §§ 250.34, 250.35 and 250.36 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(ii) Reduce the family's assistance payment to which the specific period applies by the amount of the payment attributable to the family member for that period or do not make the payment to the family; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Reduce the family's assistance payment to which the specific period applies (or the amount of the payment attributable to the family member for that period) in proportion to the number of required hours that were not completed.</P>
            <FP>For States that elect to implement paragraphs (b)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this section, the fair hearing requirements set forth at § 205.10(a)(4)(ii)(K) of this chapter apply.</FP>
            

            <P>(4) Limit the number of months that a family may receive AFDC-UP under this section when the following conditions are met:<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The State did not have on September 26, 1988, an approved AFDC-UP program under section 407 of the Social Security Act.</P>
            <P>(ii) The family received such aid (on the basis of the unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner) in at least 6 of the preceding 12 months.</P>
            <P>(iii) The State has in effect a program (described in the plan) for providing education, training, and employment services to assist parents in preparing for and obtaining employment throughout the year. Such a program may include education, training and employment activities under the JOBS program which are provided in part 250 of this chapter or under a State-designed program which provides:</P>
            <P>(A) Education and instruction for individuals who have not graduated from a secondary school or obtained an equivalent degree,</P>
            <P>(B) Training whereby an individual acquires market-oriented skills necessary for self-support, and</P>
            <P>(C) Employment services which seek to place individuals in jobs.</P>
            <P>(iv) The State must guarantee child care necessary for an individual to participate in an approved, State-designed, non-JOBS program. The regulations at part 255 of this chapter apply to such care.</P>
            <P>(v) The State has the option of providing necessary supportive services associated with an individual's participation in a State-designed, non-JOBS program. Federal financial participation is available under sections 403 (k) and (l) of the Social Security Act. The regulations at part 255 of this chapter apply to such supportive services.</P>
            <P>(vi) The State must inform an AFDC-UP family at the time of application that AFDC-UP cash assistance will terminate due to a time limitation, that any family with a child who is (or becomes) deprived due to the death, continued absence, or incapacity of a parent may receive cash assistance under the AFDC program during the time limitation for AFDC-UP, and that a program of training, education, and employment services is available to prepare the family to become self-supporting.</P>
            <P>(vii) Prior to termination due to a time limitation, the State must notify an AFDC-UP recipient family of the earliest month that it may receive AFDC-UP cash assistance again. This notification may be included in the notice of proposed action which is required pursuant to § 205.10(a)(4) of this chapter. To receive assistance again, the family must make a new application.</P>
            <P>(viii) In establishing eligibility upon re-application following months of nonpayment due to the time limitation, an otherwise eligible family that does not receive aid in a month solely by reason of the option to limit assistance under this paragraph shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the period under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, to be receiving AFDC-UP cash assistance in that month. This provision also applies if, at the time of the family's original application for assistance, eligibility was established based on the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, but eligibility could have been established based on the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal Financial Participation.</E> (1) Federal financial participation is available for payments authorized in accordance with the State plan approved under section 402 of the Act as aid to families with dependent children with respect to a child:</P>

            <P>(ii) Who is living with any of the relatives specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Act in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his (or their) own home;</P>
            <P>(iii) Who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the fact that his or her parent who is the principal earner is employed less than 100 hours a month; or exceeds that standard for a particular month if his or her work is intermittent and the excess is of a temporary nature as evidenced by the fact that he or she was under the 100-hour standard for 2 prior months and is expected to be under the standard during the next month;</P>
            <P>(iv) Whose parent who is the principal earner:</P>

            <P>(A) Has six or more quarters of work (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section) within any 13-calendar-<PRTPAGE P="100"/>quarter period ending within 1 year prior to the application for such aid,</P>
            <P>(B) Within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, or was qualified (under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section) for such compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law; and</P>
            <P>(v) Whose parent who is the principal earner:</P>
            <P>(A) Is currently participating in or available to participate in an activity in the JOBS program under part 250 of this chapter, unless exempt, or is registered with the public employment office in the State if exempt from the JOBS program under § 250.30(b)(5) of this chapter; and</P>
            <P>(B) Has not refused to apply for or accept unemployment compensation with respect to any week for which such child's parent qualifies for unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of the State or of the United States.</P>
            <P>(2) The State may not include in its claim for Federal financial participation payments made as aid under the plan with respect to a child who meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, where such payments were made:</P>
            <P>(i) For any part of the 30-day period specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) For such 30-day period if during that period the parent refused without good cause a bona fide offer of employment or training for employment;</P>
            <P>(iii) For any period beginning with the 31st day after the receipt of aid, if and for as long as no action is taken during the period to undertake appropriate steps directed toward the participation of the parent who is the principal earner in a program under part 250 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(iv) To the extent that such payments are made to meet the need of an individual who is subject to a sanction imposed, under part 250 of this chapter (for failure to meet the requirements for participation in the JOBS program).</P>
            <P>(3) Federal financial participation is available for child care and supportive services expenditures associated with participation in an approved State-designed program (as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) under titles IV-A and IV-F of the Act respectively. However, Federal financial participation is not available for any other costs, program or administrative, associated with State-designed programs.</P>
            <P>(d) For all States (other than Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands) the provisions of this section are in effect through September 30, 1998. For Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, the provisions of this section are in effect from October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1998.</P>

            <P>(b) Under the provisions of section 4(c) of Pub. L. 92-223, enacted December 28, 1971, and the provisions of section 292 of Pub. L. 92-603, enacted October 30, 1972:</P>
            <P>(1) In the case of any State which on January 1, 1972, had in effect a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act, section 1121 of the Act authorizing payments under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act for assistance in the form of institutional services in intermediate care facilities is rescinded; and</P>

            <P>(c)(1) Under the provisions of section 249D of Pub.

            </P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this paragraph,</P>
            <P>(i) An institution (see § 233.60(b)(1) of this chapter) is considered to provide medical or remedial care if it provides any care or service beyond room and board because of the physical or mental condition (or both) of its inpatients;</P>
            <P>(ii) An inpatient is an individual who is living in an institution which provides medical or remedial care and who is receiving care or service beyond room and board because of his physical or mental condition (or both).</P>
            <P>(iii) Federal financial participation is not available for any portion of the payment for care of an inpatient. It is immaterial whether such payment is made as a vendor payment or as a money payment or other cash assistance payment. It is also immaterial whether the payment is divided into components, such as separate amounts or payments for room and board, and for care or services beyond room and board, or whether the payment is considered to meet “basic” needs or “special” needs. If, however, a money payment (or protective payment) is made to an individual who is living in an institution, and such payment does not exceed a reasonable rate for room, board and laundry for individuals not living in their own homes, and no additional payment is made for such individual's care in the institution, Federal financial participation is available in the money payment (or protective payment) since the individual may spend the funds at his discretion and obtain room and board at the place of his choice.</P>

            <P>(iv) Federal financial participation is available in cash assistance payments to meet the needs of an inpatient for specific medical services, such as dental care or prescription drugs, which generally are not delivered in an institutional setting and in fact are not <PRTPAGE P="103"/>provided by the institution to the inpatient, provided that such services are not available to the individual under the State's approved title XIX plan.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assistance in the form of money payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Federal financial participation is available in money payments made under a State plan under title I, IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act to eligible families and individuals. Money payments are payments in cash, checks, or warrants immediately redeemable at par, made to the grantee or his legal representative with no restrictions imposed by the agency on the use of funds by the individual.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Protective, vendor and two-party payments for dependent children.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">State plan requirements.</E> (1) If a State plan for AFDC under title IV-A of the Social Security Act provides for protective, vendor and two-party payments for cases other than failure to participate in the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) Program under § 250.34(d), or failure by the caretaker relative to meet the eligibility requirements of § 232.11, § 232.12, or § 232.13 of this chapter. It must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) (2) through (11) of this section. In addition, the plan may provide for protective, vendor, and two-party payments at the request of recipients as provided in paragraph (a)(14) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Methods will be in effect to identify children whose relatives have demonstrated such an inability to manage funds that payments to the relative have not been or are not currently used in the best interest of the child. This means that the relative has misused funds to such an extent that allowing him or her to manage the AFDC grant is a threat to the health or safety of the child.</P>
            <P>(ii) States will establish criteria to determine if mismanagement exists. Under this provision, States may elect to use as one criterion a presumption of mismanagement based on a recipient's nonpayment of rent.</P>
            <P>(iii) Under State agency procedures, the recipient shall be notified whenever a creditor requests a protective, vendor, or two-party payment for mismangement on the basis of non-payment of bills.</P>
            <P>(iv) The recipient shall be notified by the agency of a decision not to use a protective, vendor, or two-party payment if such payment has been requested by a creditor.</P>
            <P>(v) A statement of the specific reasons that demonstrate the need for making protective, vendor, and two-party payments must be placed in the file of the child involved.</P>
            <P>(3) Criteria will be established to identify the circumstances under which protective, vendor, or two-party payments will be made in whole or in part to:</P>
            <P>(i) Another individual who is interested in or concerned with the welfare of the child or relative; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A person or persons furnishing food, living accommodations or other goods, services, or items to or for the child, relative, or essential person.</P>

            <P>(4) Procedures will be established for making protective, vendor, or two-party payments. Under this provision, part of the payment may be made to the family and part may be made to a protective payee or to a vendor, or part may be made in the form of two-party payments, i.e., checks which are drawn jointly to the order of the recipient and the person furnishing goods, services, <PRTPAGE P="104"/>or items and negotiable only upon endorsement by both the recipient and the other person.</P>
            <P>(5)-(6) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(7) Standards will be established for selection:</P>
            <P>(i) Of protective payees, who are interested in or concerned with the recepient's welfare, to act for the recipient in receiving and managing assistance, with the selection of a protective payee being made by the recipient, or with his participation and consent, to the extent possible. If it is in the best interest of the recipient for a staff member of a private agency, of the public welfare department, or of any other appropriate organization to serve as a protective payee, such selection will be made preferably from the staff of an agency or that part of the agency providing protective services for families; and the public welfare department will employ such additional staff as may be necessary to provide protective payees. The selection will not include: The executive head of the agency administering public assistance; the person determining financial eligibility for the family; special investigative or resource staff; or staff handling fiscal processes related to the recipient; or landlords, grocers, or other vendors of goods, services, or items dealing directly with the recipient.</P>
            <P>(ii) Of such persons providing goods, services, or items with the selection of such persons being made by the recipient, or with his participation and consent, to the extent possible.</P>
            <P>(8) The agency will undertake and continue special efforts to develop greater ability on the part of the relative to manage funds in such manner as to protect the welfare of the family.</P>
            <P>(9) Review will be made as frequently as indicated by the individual's circumstances, and at least once every 12 months, of:</P>
            <P>(i) The need for protective, vendor, and two-party payments; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The way in which a protective payee's responsibilities are carried out.</P>
            <P>(10) Provision will be made for termination of protective payments, or payments to a person furnishing goods or services, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) When relatives are considered able to manage funds in the best interest of the child, there will be a return to money payment status.</P>
            <P>(ii) When it appears that need for protective, vendor, or two-party payments will continue or is likely to continue beyond 2 years because all efforts have not resulted in sufficiently improved use of assistance in behalf of the child, judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative will be sought and such payments will terminate when the appointment has been made.</P>
            <P>(11)(i) Opportunity for a fair hearing pursuant to § 205.10 will be given to any individual claiming assistance in relation to the determination:</P>
            <P>(A) That a protective, vendor, and two-party payment should be made or continued.</P>
            <P>(B) As to the payee selected.</P>
            <P>(ii) In cases where the agency has elected the option to presume mismanagement based on a recipient's nonpayment of rent pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the agency may also elect the option to provide the opportunity for a fair hearing pursuant to § 205.10 either before or after the manner or form of payment has been changed for these cases.</P>

            <P>(12) In cases where an individual is sanctioned for failure to participate in WIN, employment search, CWEP, or JOBS, the State plan must provide that when protective or vendor payments are made pursuant to §§ 224.52(a)(1), 238.22, 240.22(a)(1), 240.22(b)(1) and 250.34(d) of this chapter, only paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(9)(ii), and (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section will be applicable. Under these circumstances, when protective payments are made, the entire payment will be made to the protective payee; and when vendor payments are made, at least the greater part of the payment will be through this method. However, if after making all reasonable efforts, the State agency is unable to locate an appropriate individual to whom protective payments can be made, the State may continue to make payments on behalf of the remaining members of the assistance unit to the sanctioned caretaker relative. Provision will be made for termination of protective payments, or payments to a person furnishing goods or <PRTPAGE P="105"/>services, with return to money payment status when adults who refused training, employment, or participation in employment search without good cause either accept training, employment, or employment search or agree to do so. In the case of continuing refusal of the relative to participate, payments will be continued for the children in the home in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(13) For cases in which a caretaker relative fails to meet the eligibility requirements of § 232.11, § 232.12, or § 232.13 of this chapter by failing to assign rights to support or cooperate in determining paternity, securing support, or identifying and providing information to assist the State in pursuing third party liability for medical services, the State plan must provide that only the requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) and (9)(ii) of this section will be applicable. For such cases, the entire amount of the assistance payment will be in the form of protective or vendor payments. These protective or vendor payments will be terminated, with return to money payment status, only upon compliance by the caretaker relative with the eligibility requirements of §§ 232.11, 232.12, and 232.13 of this chapter. However, if after making reasonable efforts, the State agency is unable to locate an appropriate individual to whom protective payments can be made, the State may continue to make payments to the sanctioned caretaker relative on behalf of the remaining members of the assistance unit.</P>
            <P>(14) If the plan provides for protective, vendor, or two-party payments:</P>
            <P>(i) The State may use any combination of protective, vendor, or two-party payments (at the request of the recipient),</P>
            <P>(ii) The request must be in writing from the recipient to whom payment would otherwise be made in an unrestricted manner and must be recorded or retained in the case file, and</P>
            <P>(iii) The restriction will be discontinued promptly upon the written request of the recipient who initiated it.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal financial participation.</E> Federal financial participation is available in payments which otherwise qualify as money payments with respect to an eligible dependent child, but which are made as protective, vendor or two-party payments under this section. Payrolls must identify protective, vendor, or two-party payments either by use of a separate payroll for these cases or by using a special identifying code or symbol on the regular payroll. The payment must be supported by an authorization of award through amendment of an existing authorization document for each case or by preparation of a separate authorization document. In either instance, the authorization document must be a formal agency record signed by a responsible agency official, showing the name of each eligible child and relative, the amount of payment authorized and the name of the protective, vendor or two-party payee.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">State plan requirements.</E> If a State plan for OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD under the Social Security Act includes provisions for protective payments, the State plan must provide that:</P>
            <P>(1) Methods will be in effect to determine that needy individuals have, by reason of physical or mental condition, such inability to manage funds that making payment to them would be contrary to their welfare; such methods to include medical or psychological evaluations, or other reports of physical or mental conditions including observation of gross conditions such as extensive paralysis, serious mental retardation, continued disorientation, or severe memory loss.</P>
            <P>(2) There will be responsibility to assure referral to social services for appropriate action to protect recipients where problems and needs for services and care of the recipients are manifestly beyond the ability of the protective payee to handle. (See paragraph (a)(5) of this section.)</P>

            <P>(3) Standards will be established for selection of protective payees who are <PRTPAGE P="106"/>interested in or concerned with the individual's welfare, to act for the individual in receiving and managing assistance, with the selection of a protective payee being made by the individual, or with his participation and consent, to the extent possible. If it is in the best interest of the individual for a staff member of a private agency, of the public welfare department, or of any other appropriate organization to serve as a protective payee, such selection will be made preferably from the staff of an agency or that part of the agency providing protective services for families or for the disabled or aged group of which the recipient is a member; and such staff of the public welfare department will be utilized only to the extent that the department has adequate staff for this purpose. The selection will not include: The executive head of the agency administering public assistance; the person determining financial eligibility for the individual; special investigative or resource staff, or staff handling fiscal processes related to the recipient; or landlords, grocers, or other vendors of goods or services dealing directly with the recipient—such as the proprietor, administrator or fiscal agent of a nursing home, or social care, medical or nonmedical institution, except for the superintendent of a public institution for mental diseases or a public institution for the mentally retarded, or the designee of such superintendent, when no other suitable protective payee can be found and there are appropriate staff available to assist the superintendent in carrying out the protective payment function.</P>
            <P>(4) Protective payments will be made only in cases in which the assistance payment, with other available income, meets all the needs of the individual, using the State's standards for assistance for the pertinent program, not standards for protective payment cases only.</P>
            <P>(5) The agency will undertake and continue special efforts to protect the welfare of such individuals and to improve, to the extent possible, their capacity for self-care and to manage funds.</P>
            <P>(6) Reconsideration of the need for protective payments and the way in which a protective payee's responsibilities are carried out will be as frequent as indicated by the individual's circumstances and at least every 6 months.</P>
            <P>(7) Provision will be made for appropriate termination of protective payments as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) When individuals are considered able to manage funds in their best interest, there will be a return to money payment status.</P>
            <P>(ii) When a judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative appears to serve the best interest of the individual, such appointment will be sought and the protective payment will terminate when the appointment has been made.</P>
            <P>(8) Opportunity for a fair hearing will be given to any individual claiming assistance in relation to the determination that a protective payment should be made or continued, and in relation to the payee selected.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal financial participation.</E> Federal financial participation is available for payments, which otherwise qualify as money payments with respect to a needy individual, but which are made to a protective payee under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The payment must be supported by an authorization of award through amendment of an existing authorization document for such case or by preparation of a separate authorization document. In either instance, the authorization document must be a formal agency record signed by a responsible agency official showing the name of each eligible individual, the amount of payment authorized and the name of the protective payee. Payrolls must identify protective payment cases either by use of a separate payroll for these cases or by using a special identifying code or symbol on the regular payroll.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assistance in the form of institutional services in intermediate care facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability and State plan requirements.</E> A State which, on January 1, 1972, did not have in effect a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act may provide assistance under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act in the form of institutional services in intermediate care facilities as authorized under title XI of the Act, until the first day of the first month (occurring after January 1, 1972) that such State does have in effect a State plan approved under title XIX of the Act. In any State which may provide such assistance as authorized under title XI of the Act, a State plan under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act which includes such assistance must:</P>
            <P>(1) Provide that such benefits will be provided only to individuals who:</P>
            <P>(i) Are entitled (or would, if not receiving institutional services in intermediate care facilities, be entitled) to receive assistance, under the State plan, in the form of money payments; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Because of their physical or mental condition (or both) require living accommodations and care which, as a practical matter, can be made available to them only through institutional facilities; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Do not have such an illness, disease, injury, or other condition as to require the degree of care and treatment which a hospital or skilled nursing home (as that term is employed in title XIX) is designed to provide.</P>
            <P>(2) Provide that, in determining financial eligibility for benefits in the form of institutional services in intermediate care facilities, available income will be applied, first for personal and incidental needs including clothing, and that any remaining income will be applied to the costs of care in the intermediate care facility.</P>
            <P>(3) Provide methods of administration that include:</P>

            <P>(i) Placing of responsibility, within the State agency, with one or more staff members with sufficient staff time exclusive of other duties to direct and guide the agency's activities with respect to services in intermediate care facilities, including arrangements for consultation and working relationships with the State standard-setting authority and State agencies responsible for mental health and for mental retardation;<PRTPAGE P="108"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) In relation to authorization of benefits, provisions for evaluation by a physician of the individual's physical and mental condition and the kinds and amounts of care he requires; evaluation by the agency worker of the resources available in the home, family and community; and participation by the recipient in determining where he is to receive care, except that in the case of services being provided in a Christian Science Sanatorium, certification by a qualified Christian Science practitioner that the individual meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section may be substituted for the evaluation by a physician;</P>
            <P>(iii) Provisions for redetermination at least semiannually that the individual is properly a recipient of intermediate care.</P>
            <P>(4) Provide for regular, periodic review and reevaluation no less often than annually (by or on behalf of the State agency administering the plan and in addition to the activities described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) of recipients in intermediate care facilities to determine whether their current physical and mental conditions are such as to indicate continued placement in the intermediate care facility, whether the services actually rendered are adequate and responsive to the conditions and needs identified, and whether a change to other living arrangements, or other institutional facilities (including skilled nursing homes) is indicated. Such reviews must be followed by appropriate action on the part of the State agency administering the plan. They must be conducted by or under the supervision of a physician with participation by a registered professional nurse and other appropriate medical and social service personnel not employed by or having a financial interest in the facility, except that, in the case of recipients who have elected care in a Christian Science sanatorium, review by a physician or other medical personnel is not required.</P>
            <P>(5) Provide that all services with respect to social and related problems which the agency makes available to applicants and recipients of assistance under the plan will be equally available to all applicants for and recipients of benefits in the form of institutional services in intermediate care facilities.</P>
            <P>(6) Specify the types of facilities, however described, that will qualify under the State plan for participation as intermediate care facilities, and provide for availability to the Department of Health and Human Services, upon request of (i) copies of the State's requirements for licensing of such facilities, (ii) any requirements imposed by the State in addition to licensing and to definition of intermediate care facilities, and (iii) a description of the manner in which such requirements are applied and enforced including copies of agreements or contracts, if any, with the licensing authority for this purpose.</P>
            <P>(7) Provide for and describe methods of determining amounts of vendor payments to intermediate care facilities which systematically relate amounts of the payment to the kinds, levels, and quantities of services provided to the recipients by the institutions and to the cost of providing such services.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Other requirements.</E> Except when inconsistent with purposes of section 1121 of the Act or contrary to any provision therein, any modification, pursuant thereto, of an approved State plan shall be subject to the same conditions, limitations, rights, and obligations as obtained with respect to such approved State plan. Included specifically among such conditions and limitations are the provisions of titles I, X, XIV, and XVI relating to payments to or care in behalf of any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal financial participation.</E> (1) Federal financial participation is available under section 1121 of the Act in vendor payments for institutional services provided to individuals who are eligible under the respective State plan and who are residents in intermediate care facilities. The rate of participation is the same as for money payments under the respective title or, if the State so elects, at the rate of the Federal medical assistance percentage as defined in section 1905(b) of the Act. Such Federal financial participation ends on the date specified in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="109"/>(c)(2) of this section, or 12 months after the date when the State first has in effect a State plan approved under title XIX of the Act, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(2) For the period from January 1, 1972, to the date on which a determination is made under the provisions of 42 CFR 449.33 as to a facility's eligibility to receive payments for intermediate care facility services under the medical assistance program, title XIX of the Act, but not later than 12 months following the effective date of these regulations, Federal financial participation in payments for such services under title XIX is governed by the provisions of this section, applied to State plans under title XIX.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Definition of terms.</E> For purposes of section 1121 of the Social Security Act, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Institutional services.</E> The term, <E T="03">institutional services,</E> means those items and services provided by or under the auspices of the institution which contribute to the health, comfort, and well-being of the residents thereof; except that the term, <E T="03">institutional services,</E> does not include allowances for clothing and incidental expenses for which money payments to recipients are made under the plan, nor does it include medical care, in a form identifiable as such and separable from the routine services of the facility, for which vendor payments may be made under a State plan approved under title XIX.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Distinct part of an institution.</E> A <E T="03">distinct part</E> of an institution is defined as a part which meets the definition of an intermediate care facility and the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Identifiable unit.</E> The <E T="03">distinct part</E> of the institution is an entire unit such as an entire ward or contiguous wards, wing, floor, or building. It consists of all beds and related facilities in the unit and houses all residents, except as hereafter provided, for whom payment is being made for intermediate care. It is clearly identified and is approved, in writing, by the agency applying the definition of intermediate care facility herein.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Staff.</E> Appropriate personnel are assigned and work regularly in the unit. Immediate supervision of staff is provided in the unit at all time by qualified personnel.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Shared facilities and services.</E> The distinct part may share such central services and facilities as management services, building maintenance and laundry, with other units.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recipient count, Federal financial participation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Pursuant to the formulas in sections 3, 403, 1003, 1118, 1121, 1403, and 1603 of the Social Security Act, it is necessary to identify expenditures that may be included in claims for Federal financial participation. The quarterly statement of expenditures and recoveries which is required for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, and AABD must include, as a part of the basis for computing the amount of Federal participation in such expenditures, the number of eligible recipients each month. However, where the State is making claims under section 1118 of the Act or under optional provisions for Federal sharing specified in such paragraphs no recipient count is involved. Vendor payments for medical care may not be considered if the State has a plan approved under title XIX of the Act. The procedures for determining recipient count are set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Adult assistance categories.</E> For each adult assistance category, under title I, X, XIV, or XVI, of the Act, the recipient count for any month may include:
            </P>
            <P>(1) Eligible recipients who receive money payments or in whose behalf protective payments are made for that month:</P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such payments are not excluded from Federal financial participation under the provisions of § 233.145(c) of this chapter; plus</FP>

            <P>(2) Other eligible recipients in whose behalf payments are made for institutional services in intermediate care facilities for that month, but only in a State which does not have in effect a plan approved under Title XIX of the Act. (See § 233.145(b)(2) of this chapter.)
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">AFDC category.</E> For the AFDC category under title IV, part A, of the Act:</P>
            <P>(1) The recipient count for any month includes:</P>
            <P>(i) Eligible recipients in families which receive a money payment, plus</P>
            <P>(ii) Eligible recipients in families not otherwise counted on whose behalf protective or nonmedical vendor assistance payments are made for such month in accordance with the vendor payment provisions at § 234.60, provided that such payments are not excluded from Federal financial participation under the provisions of § 233.145(c) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) For the purpose of this provision, <E T="03">recipients</E> means, if otherwise eligible:</P>
            <P>(i) Children;</P>
            <P>(ii) In a home with no parent who is the caretaker relative, an otherwise eligible relative of specified degree;</P>
            <P>(iii) Parent(s);</P>
            <P>(iv) The spouse of such parent, in the case of AFDC eligibility due to incapacity or unemployment;</P>

            <P>(3) As used in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the term <E T="03">parent</E> means the natural or adoptive parent, or the stepparent who is married to the child's natural or adoptive parent and is legally obligated to support the child under a State law of general applicability which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the same extent that natural or adoptive parents are required to support their children; and the term “spouse” as used in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section means an individual who is the husband or wife of the child's own parent, as defined above, by reason of a legal marriage as defined under State law.</P>
            <P>(4) Where there are two or more dependent children living in a place of residence with two other persons and each of such other persons is a relative who has responsibility for the care and control of one or more of the dependent children, there may be two AFDC families (assistance units), if neither family includes a parent or sibling included in the other family pursuant to § 206.10 (a)(1)(vii).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Essential person.</E> An <E T="03">essential person</E> or other ineligible person who is living with the eligible person may not be counted as a recipient.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The term “assistance” includes cash, payments, vouchers, and other forms of benefits designed to meet a family's ongoing basic needs (i.e., for food, clothing, shelter, utilities, household goods, personal care items, and general incidental expenses).</P>
              <P>(2) It includes such benefits even when they are:</P>
              <P>(i) Provided in the form of payments by a TANF agency, or other agency on its behalf, to individual recipients; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Conditioned on participation in work experience or community service (or any other work activity under § 261.30 of this chapter).</P>

              <P>(1) Nonrecurrent, short-term benefits that:</P>
              <P>(i) Are designed to deal with a specific crisis situation or episode of need;</P>
              <P>(ii) Are not intended to meet recurrent or ongoing needs; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Will not extend beyond four months.</P>
              <P>(2) Work subsidies (i.e., payments to employers or third parties to help cover the costs of employee wages, benefits, supervision, and training);</P>
              <P>(3) Supportive services such as child care and transportation provided to families who are employed;</P>
              <P>(4) Refundable earned income tax credits;</P>
              <P>(5) Contributions to, and distributions from, Individual Development Accounts;</P>

              <P>(7) Transportation benefits provided under a Job Access or Reverse Commute project, pursuant to section 404(k) of the Act, to an individual who is not otherwise receiving assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) The definition of the term assistance specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Does not apply to the use of the term assistance at part 263, subpart A, or at part 264, subpart B, of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(2) Does not preclude a State from providing other types of benefits and services in support of the TANF goal at § 260.20(a).</P>

              <P>(a) For the purpose of § 264.1(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, WtW cash assistance only includes benefits that:</P>
              <P>(1) Meet the definition of assistance at § 260.31; and</P>
              <P>(2) Are directed at basic needs.</P>
              <P>(b) Thus, it includes benefits described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of § 260.31, but excludes benefits described in paragraph (a)(3) of § 260.31.</P>
              <P>(c) It only includes benefits identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section when they are provided in the form of cash payments, checks, reimbursements, electronic funds transfers, or any other form that can legally be converted to currency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When are expenditures on State or local tax credits allowable expenditures for TANF-related purposes?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) To be an allowable expenditure for TANF-related purposes, any tax <PRTPAGE P="122"/>credit program must be reasonably calculated to accomplish one of the purposes of the TANF program, as specified at § 260.20.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) In addition, pursuant to the definition of expenditure at § 260.30, we would only consider the refundable portion of a State or local tax credit to be an allowable expenditure.</P>
              <P>(2) Under a State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program, the refundable portion that may count as an expenditure is the amount that exceeds a family's State income tax liability prior to application of the EITC. (The family's tax liability is the amount owed prior to any adjustments for credits or payments.) In other words, we would count only the portion of a State EITC that the State refunds to a family and that is above the amount of EITC used as credit towards the family's State income tax liability.</P>
              <P>(3) For other refundable (and allowable) State and local tax credits, such as refundable dependent care credits, the refundable portion that would count as an expenditure is the amount of the credit that exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability prior to the application of the credit. (The taxpayer's liability is the amount owed prior to any adjustments for credits or payments.) In other words, we would count only the portion of the credit that the State refunds to the taxpayer and that is above the amount of the credit applied against the taxpayer's tax bill.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 260.34</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>When do the Charitable Choice provisions of TANF apply?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) These Charitable Choice provisions apply whenever a State or local government uses Federal TANF funds or expends State and local funds used to meet maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements of the TANF program to directly procure services and benefits from non-governmental organizations, or provides TANF beneficiaries with certificates, vouchers, or other forms of indirect disbursement redeemable from such organizations. For purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Direct funding or funds provided directly</E> means that the government or an intermediate organization with the same duties as a governmental entity under this part selects the provider and purchases the needed services straight from the provider (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> via a contract or cooperative agreement).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Indirect funding or funds provided indirectly</E> means placing the choice of service provider in the hands of the beneficiary, and then paying for the cost of that service through a voucher, certificate, or other similar means of payment.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in TANF as long as their Federal TANF or State MOE funded services are provided consistent with the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</P>
              <P>(2) Neither the Federal government nor a State or local government in its use of Federal TANF or State MOE funds shall, in the selection of service providers, discriminate for or against an organization that applies to provide, or provides TANF services or benefits on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation.</P>
              <P>(c) No Federal TANF or State MOE funds provided directly to participating organizations may be expended for inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. If an organization conducts such activities, it must offer them separately, in time or location, from the programs or services for which it receives direct Federal TANF or State MOE funds under this part, and participation must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of those programs or services.</P>

              <P>(d) A religious organization that participates in the TANF program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and local governments and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not expend Federal TANF or State MOE funds that it receives directly to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide TANF-funded services without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols. <PRTPAGE P="123"/>In addition, a Federal TANF or State MOE funded religious organization retains the authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.</P>
              <P>(e) The participation of a religious organization in, or its receipt of funds from, a TANF program does not affect that organization's exemption provided under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1 regarding employment practices.</P>
              <P>(f) A religious organization that receives Federal TANF or State MOE funds shall not, in providing program services or benefits, discriminate against a TANF applicant or recipient on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to actively participate in a religious practice.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) If an otherwise eligible TANF applicant or recipient objects to the religious character of a TANF service provider, the recipient is entitled to receive services from an alternative provider to which the individual has no religious objection. In such cases, the State or local agency must refer the individual to an alternative provider of services within a reasonable period of time, as defined by the State or local agency. That alternative provider must be reasonably accessible and have the capacity to provide comparable services to the individual. Such services shall have a value that is not less than the value of the services that the individual would have received from the program participant to which the individual had such objection, as defined by the State or local agency.</P>
              <P>(2) The alternative provider need not be a secular organization. It must simply be a provider to which the recipient has no religious objection. States may adopt reasonable definitions of the terms “reasonably accessible,” “a reasonable period of time,” “comparable,” “capacity,” and “ value that is not less than.” We expect States to apply these terms in a fair and consistent manner.</P>
              <P>(3) The appropriate State or local governments that administer Federal TANF or State MOE funded programs shall ensure that notice of their right to alternative services is provided to applicants or recipients. The notice must clearly articulate the recipient's right to a referral and to services that reasonably meet the timeliness, capacity, accessibility, and equivalency requirements discussed above.</P>
              <P>(h) Religious organizations that receive Federal TANF and State MOE funds are subject to the same regulations as other non-governmental organizations to account, in accordance with generally accepted auditing/accounting principles, for the use of such funds. Religious organizations may keep Federal TANF and State MOE funds they receive for services segregated in a separate account from non-governmental funds. If religious organizations choose to segregate their funds in this manner, only the Federal TANF and State MOE funds are subject to audit by the government under the program.</P>
              <P>(i) This section applies whenever a State or local organization uses Federal TANF or State MOE funds to procure services and benefits from non-governmental organizations, or redeems certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement from them whether with Federal funds, or State and local funds claimed to meet the MOE requirements of section 409(a)(7) of the Social Security Act.

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this subpart?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Under section 415 of the Act, if a State was granted a waiver under section 1115 of the Act and that waiver was in effect on August 22, 1996, the amendments made by PRWORA do not apply for the period of the waiver, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the waiver and the State elects to continue its waiver.</P>
              <P>(b) Identification of waiver inconsistencies is relevant for the determination of penalties in three areas:</P>
              <P>(1) Under § 261.50 of this chapter for failing to meet the work participation rates at part 261 of this chapter;</P>

              <P>(a) If a State is implementing a work participation component under a waiver, in accordance with this subpart, the provisions of section 407 of the Act will not apply in determining if a penalty should be imposed, to the extent that the provision is inconsistent with the waiver.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of determining if the State's demonstration has a work participation component, the waiver list for the demonstration must include one or more specific provisions that directly correspond to the work policies in section 407 of the Act (i.e., change allowable JOBS activities, exemptions from JOBS participation, hours of required JOBS participation, or sanctions for noncompliance with JOBS participation).</P>
              <P>(c) Corresponding to the inconsistencies certified by the Governor under § 260.75:</P>

              <SUBJECT>How do existing welfare reform waivers affect the application of the Federal time-limit provisions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) If a State is implementing a time-limit component under a waiver, in accordance with this subpart, the provisions of section 408(a)(7) of the Act will not apply in determining if a penalty should be imposed, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the waiver.</P>

              <P>(2) For the purpose of determining if the State's demonstration has a time-limit component, the waiver list for the demonstration must include provisions that directly correspond to the time-limit policies enumerated in section 408(a)(7) of the Act (i.e., address <PRTPAGE P="128"/>which individuals or families are subject to, or exempt from, terminations of assistance based solely on the passage of time or who qualifies for extensions to the time limit).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Generally, under an approved waiver, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a State will count, toward the Federal five-year limit, all months for which the head-of-household or spouse of the head-of-household subject to the State time limit receives assistance with Federal TANF funds, just as it would if it did not have an approved waiver.</P>
              <P>(2) The State need not count, toward the Federal five-year limit, any months for which a head-of-household or spouse of the head-of-household receives assistance with Federal TANF funds while that individual is exempt from the State's time limit under the State's approved waiver.</P>
              <P>(3) Where a State has continued a time limit under waivers that only terminates assistance for adults, the State need not count, toward the Federal five-year limit, any months for which an adult subject to the State time limit receives assistance with Federal TANF funds.</P>
              <P>(4) The State may continue to provide assistance with Federal TANF funds for more than 60 months, without a numerical limit, to families provided extensions to the State time limit, under the provisions of the terms and conditions of the approved waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) Corresponding to the inconsistencies certified by the Governor under § 260.75, we will calculate the State's time-limit exceptions by:</P>
              <P>(1) Excluding, from the determination of the number of months of Federal assistance received by a family:</P>
              <P>(i) Any month in which the adult(s) were exempt from the State's time limit under the terms of an approved waiver or any months in which the children received assistance under a waiver that only terminated assistance to adults; and</P>

              <P>(a) The Governor of the State must certify in writing to the Secretary that:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicable policies have been continually applied in operating the TANF program, as described in § 260.72(c);</P>

              <P>(b) The certification must identify the specific inconsistencies that the State chooses to continue with respect to work and time limits.</P>
              <P>(1) If the waiver inconsistency claim includes work provisions, the certification must specify the standards that will apply, in lieu of the provisions in subparts B and C of part 261 of this chapter, to determine:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of two-parent and all-parent cases that are exempt from participation, if any, for the purpose of determining the denominator of the work participation rate;</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of nonexempt two-parent and all-parent cases that are participating in work activities for the purpose of determining the numerator of the work participation rate, including standards applicable to;</P>
              <P>(A) Countable work activities; and</P>
              <P>(B) Required hours of work for participation for individual participants; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The penalty against an individual or family when an individual refuses to work.</P>
              <P>(2) If the waiver inconsistency claim includes time-limit provisions, the certification must include the standards that will apply, in lieu of the provisions in § 264.1 of this chapter, in determining:</P>
              <P>(i) Which families are counted toward the Federal time limit; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether a family is eligible for an extension of its time limit on federally funded assistance.</P>
              <P>(3) If the State is continuing policies for evaluation purposes in accordance with § 260.76:</P>

              <P>(i) The certification must specify any special work or time-limit standards <PRTPAGE P="129"/>that apply to the control group and experimental group cases; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The State may choose to exclude cases assigned to the experimental and control groups, which are not otherwise exempt, for the purpose of calculating the work participation rate or determining State compliance related to limiting assistance to families including adults who have received 60 months of Federal TANF assistance. In doing so, the State may effectively exclude all experimental group cases and/or control group cases, not otherwise exempt, but may not exclude individual cases on a selective basis.</P>
              <P>(c) The certification may include a claim of inconsistency with respect to hours of required participation in work activities only if the State has written evidence that, when implemented, the waiver policies established specific requirements related to hours of work for nonexempt individuals.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) The Governor's certification must be provided no later than October 1, 1999.</P>
              <P>(2) If a State modifies its waiver policies in a way that has a substantive effect on the determination of its work sanctions, or the calculation of its work participation rates or its time-limit exceptions, it must submit an amended certification no later than the end of the fiscal quarter in which the modifications take effect.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will we hold a State accountable for achieving the work objectives of TANF?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each State must meet two separate work participation rates in FY 2006 and thereafter, one—the two-parent rate based on how well it succeeds in helping work-eligible individuals in two-parent families find work activities described at § 261.30, the other—the overall rate based on how well it succeeds in finding those activities for work-eligible individuals in all the families that it serves.</P>

              <P>(c) If the data show that a State met both participation rates in a fiscal year, then the percentage of historic State expenditures that it must expend under TANF, pursuant to § 263.1 of this chapter, decreases from 80 percent to 75 percent for that fiscal year.

However, if a family with a work-eligible individual has been penalized for refusal to participate in work activities for more than three of the last 12 months, we will not exclude it from the participation rate calculation.</P>
              <P>(3) At State option, we will include in the participation rate calculation families with a work-eligible individual that have been penalized for refusing to work no more than three of the last 12 months.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) If a family receives assistance for only part of a month, we will count it as a month of participation if a work-eligible individual is engaged in work for the minimum average number of hours in each full week that the family receives assistance in that month.</P>
              <P>(2) If a State pays benefits retroactively (i.e., for the period between application and approval of benefits), it has the option to consider the family to be receiving assistance during the period of retroactivity.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will we determine a State's two-parent work rate?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The two-parent participation rate for a fiscal year is the average of the State's two-parent participation rates for each month in the fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(2) The rate applies to two-parent families with two work-eligible individuals. However, if one of the parents is a work-eligible individual with a disability, we will not consider the family to be a two-parent family; i.e., we will not include such a family in either the numerator or denominator of the two-parent rate.</P>
              <P>(b) We determine a State's two-parent participation rate for the month as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of two-parent TANF and SSP-MOE families in which both parents are work-eligible individuals and together they meet the requirements set forth in § 261.32 for the month (i.e., the numerator), divided by,</P>
              <P>(2) The number of two-parent TANF and SSP-MOE families in which both parents are work-eligible individuals during the month, minus the number of such two-parent families that are subject to a penalty for refusing to work in that month (the denominator). However, if a family with a work-eligible individual has been penalized for more than three months of the last 12 months, we will not exclude it from the participation rate calculation.</P>

              <P>(3) At State option, we will include in the participation rate calculation families with a work-eligible individual that have been penalized for refusing to <PRTPAGE P="135"/>work no more than three of the last 12 months.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section, a two-parent family includes, at a minimum, all families with two natural or adoptive parents (of the same minor child) who are work-eligible individuals and living in the home, unless both are minors and neither is a head-of-household.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If the family receives assistance for only part of a month, we will count it as a month of participation if a work-eligible individual in the family (or both work-eligible individuals, if they are both required to work) is engaged in work for the minimum average number of hours in each full week that the family receives assistance in that month.</P>
              <P>(2) If a State pays benefits retroactively (i.e., for the period between application and approval of benefits), it has the option to consider the family to be receiving assistance during the period of retroactivity.</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a family with two work-eligible parents counts as engaged in work for the month for the two-parent rate if:</P>
              <P>(1) Work-eligible parents in the family are participating in work activities for a combined average of at least 35 hours per week during the month, and</P>

              <P>(a) Vocational educational training may only count for a total of 12 months for any individual.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A recipient who is married or a single head-of-household under 20 years old counts as engaged in work in a month if he or she:</P>
              <P>(i) Maintains satisfactory attendance at a secondary school or the equivalent during the month; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Participates in education directly related to employment for an average of at least 20 hours per week during the month.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an individual's participation in job search and job readiness assistance counts for a maximum of six weeks in the preceding 12-month period.</P>
              <P>(b) If the State's total unemployment rate is at least 50 percent greater than the United States' total unemployment rate or if the State meets the definition of a “needy State”, specified at § 260.30 of this chapter, then an individual's participation in job search and job readiness assistance counts for a maximum of 12 weeks in that 12-month period.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a week equals 20 hours for a work-eligible individual who is a single custodial parent with a child under six years of age and equals 30 hours for all other work-eligible individuals.</P>
              <P>(d) An individual's participation in job search and job readiness assistance does not count for a week that immediately follows four consecutive weeks in which the State reports any hours of such participation in the preceding 12-month period. For purposes of this paragraph a week means seven consecutive days.</P>
              <P>(e) Not more than once for any individual in the preceding 12-month period, a State may count three or four days of job search and job readiness assistance during a week as a full week of participation. We calculate a full week of participation based on the average daily hours of participation for three or four days and will prorate participation at that level for the remaining one or two days to determine the total hours for a five-day week. Any prorated hours of participation must be included in the calculation of total hours permitted under the limitation in this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The minimum two-parent participation rate the State must meet for the fiscal year (as provided at § 261.23) decreases, at State option, by either:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of percentage points the prior-year two-parent caseload, including two-parent cases receiving assistance under a separate State program (as provided at § 261.42(b)), fell in comparison to the FY 2005 two-parent caseload, including two-parent cases receiving assistance under a separate State program; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of percentage points the prior-year overall caseload, including assistance under a separate State program (as provided at § 261.42(b)), fell in comparison to the FY 2005 overall caseload, including cases receiving assistance under a separate State program.</P>
              <P>(3) For the credit calculation, we will refer to the fiscal year that precedes the fiscal year to which the credit applies as the “comparison year.”</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The calculations in paragraph (a) of this section must disregard caseload reductions due to requirements of Federal law and to changes that a State has made in its eligibility criteria in comparison to its criteria in effect in FY 2005.</P>
              <P>(2) At State option, the calculation may offset the disregard of caseload reductions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by changes in eligibility criteria that increase caseloads.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) To establish the caseload base for FY 2005 and to determine the comparison-year caseload, we will use the combined TANF and Separate State Program caseload figures reported on the Form ACF-199, TANF Data Report, and Form ACF-209, SSP-MOE Data Report, respectively.</P>
              <P>(2) To qualify for a caseload reduction, a State must have reported monthly caseload information, including cases in separate State programs, for FY 2005 and the comparison year for cases receiving assistance as defined at § 261.43.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) A State may correct erroneous data or submit accurate data to adjust program data or to include unduplicated cases within the fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(2) We will accept the information and estimates provided by a State, unless they are implausible based on the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) We may conduct on-site reviews and inspect administrative records on applications, case closures, or other administrative data sources to validate the accuracy of the State estimates.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to receive a caseload reduction credit, a State must submit a Caseload Reduction Report to us containing the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) A listing of, and implementation dates for, all State and Federal eligibility changes, as defined at § 261.42, made by the State since the beginning of FY 2006;</P>
              <P>(2) A numerical estimate of the positive or negative average monthly impact on the comparison-year caseload of each eligibility change (based, as appropriate, on application denials, case closures or other analyses);</P>
              <P>(3) An overall estimate of the total net positive or negative impact on the applicable caseload as a result of all such eligibility changes;</P>
              <P>(4) An estimate of the State's caseload reduction credit;</P>
              <P>(5) A description of the methodology and the supporting data that a State used to calculate its caseload reduction estimates; and</P>

              <P>(c)(1) A State requesting a caseload reduction credit for the overall participation rate must base its estimates of the impact of eligibility changes on decreases in its comparison-year overall caseload compared to the FY 2005 overall caseload baseline established in accordance with § 261.40(d).</P>
              <P>(2) A State requesting a caseload reduction credit for its two-parent rate must base its estimates of the impact of eligibility changes on decreases in either:</P>
              <P>(i) Its two-parent caseload compared to the FY 2005 base-year two-parent caseload baseline established in accordance with § 261.40(d); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Its overall caseload compared to the FY 2005 base-year overall caseload baseline established in accordance with § 261.40(d).</P>
              <P>(d)(1) For each State, we will assess the adequacy of information and estimates using the following criteria: Its methodology; Its estimates of impact compared to other States; the quality of its data; and the completeness and adequacy of its documentation.</P>
              <P>(2) If we request additional information to develop or validate estimates, the State may negotiate an appropriate deadline or provide the information within 30 days of the date of our request.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) A State's caseload reduction credit must not include caseload decreases due to Federal requirements or State changes in eligibility rules since FY 2005 that directly affect a family's eligibility for assistance. These include, but are not limited to, more stringent income and resource limitations, time limits, full family sanctions, and other new requirements that deny families assistance when an individual does not comply with work requirements, cooperate with child support, or fulfill other behavioral requirements.<PRTPAGE P="140"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) At State option, a State's caseload reduction credit may include caseload increases due to Federal requirements or State changes in eligibility rules since FY 2005 if used to offset caseload decreases in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) A State may not receive a caseload reduction credit that exceeds the actual caseload decline between FY 2005 and the comparison year.</P>
              <P>(4) A State may count the reductions attributable to enforcement mechanisms or procedural requirements that are used to enforce existing eligibility criteria (e.g., fingerprinting or other verification techniques) to the extent that such mechanisms or requirements identify or deter families otherwise ineligible under existing rules.</P>
              <P>(b) A State must include cases receiving assistance in separate State programs as part of its FY 2005 caseload and comparison-year caseload. However, if a State provides documentation that separate State program cases overlap with or duplicate cases in the TANF caseload, we will exclude them from the caseload count.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the definition of a “case receiving assistance” in calculating the caseload reduction credit?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The caseload reduction credit is based on decreases in caseloads receiving TANF- or SSP-MOE-funded assistance (other than those excluded pursuant to § 261.42).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A State that is investing State MOE funds in excess of the required 80 percent or 75 percent basic MOE amount need only include the pro rata share of caseloads receiving assistance that is required to meet basic MOE requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a State may exclude from the overall caseload reduction credit calculation the number of cases funded with excess MOE. This number is calculated by dividing annual excess MOE expenditures on assistance by the average monthly expenditures on assistance per case for the fiscal year,</P>
              <P>(i) Where annual excess MOE expenditures on assistance equal total annual MOE expenditures minus the percentage of historic State expenditures specified in paragraph (v) of this section, multiplied by the percentage that annual expenditures on assistance (both Federal and State) represent of all annual expenditures, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the average monthly assistance expenditures per case for the fiscal year equal the sum of annual TANF and SSP-MOE assistance expenditures (both Federal and State) divided by the average monthly sum of TANF and SSP-MOE caseloads for the fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the excess MOE calculation is for a separate two-parent caseload reduction credit, we multiply the number of cases funded with excess MOE by the average monthly percentage of two-parent cases in the State's total (TANF plus SSP-MOE) average monthly caseload.</P>
              <P>(iv) All financial data must agree with data reported on the TANF Financial Report (form ACF-196) and all caseload data must agree with data reported on the TANF Data and SSP-MOE Data Reports (forms ACF-199 and ACF-209).</P>
              <P>(v) The State must use 80 percent of historic expenditures when calculating excess MOE; however if it has met the work participation requirements for the year, it may use 75 percent of historic expenditures.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What happens if a State fails to meet the participation rates?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If we determine that a State did not achieve one of the required minimum work participation rates, we must reduce the SFAG payable to the State.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) If there was no penalty for the preceding fiscal year, the base penalty for the current fiscal year is five percent of the adjusted SFAG.<PRTPAGE P="141"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) For each consecutive year that the State is subject to a penalty under this part, we will increase the amount of the base penalty by two percentage points over the previous year's penalty. However, the penalty can never exceed 21 percent of the State's adjusted SFAG.</P>
              <P>(c) We impose a penalty by reducing the SFAG payable for the fiscal year that immediately follows our final determination that a State is subject to a penalty and our final determination of the penalty amount.</P>
              <P>(d) In accordance with the procedures specified at § 262.4 of this chapter, a State may dispute our determination that it is subject to a penalty.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances will we reduce the amount of the penalty below the maximum?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) We will reduce the amount of the penalty based on the degree of the State's noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(1) If the State fails only the two-parent participation rate specified at § 261.23, reduced by any applicable caseload reduction credit, its maximum penalty will be a percentage of the penalty specified at § 261.50. This percentage will equal the percentage of two-parent cases in the State's total caseload.</P>
              <P>(2) If the State fails the overall participation rate specified at § 261.21, reduced by any applicable caseload reduction credit, or both rates, its maximum penalty will be the penalty specified at § 261.50.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) In order to receive a reduction of the penalty amounts determined under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) The State must achieve participation rates equal to a threshold level defined as 50 percent of the applicable minimum participation rate at § 261.21 or § 261.23, minus any caseload reduction credit determined pursuant to subpart D of this part; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The adjustment factor for changes in the number of individuals engaged in work, described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, must be greater than zero.</P>
              <P>(2) If the State meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, we will base its reduction on the severity of the failure. For this purpose, we will calculate the severity of the State's failure based on:</P>
              <P>(i) The degree to which it missed the target rate;</P>
              <P>(ii) An adjustment factor that accounts for changes in the number of individuals who are engaged in work in the State since the prior year; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The number of consecutive years in which the State failed to meet the participation rates and the number of rates missed.</P>
              <P>(3) We will determine the degree to which the State missed the target rate using the ratio of the following two factors:</P>
              <P>(i) The difference between the participation rate achieved by the State and the 50-percent threshold level (adjusted for any caseload reduction credit determined pursuant to subpart D of this part); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The difference between the minimum applicable participation rate and the threshold level (both adjusted for any caseload reduction credit determined pursuant to subpart D of this part).</P>
              <P>(4) We will calculate the adjustment factor for changes in the number of individuals engaged in work using the following formula:</P>
              <P>(i) The average monthly number of individuals engaged in work in the penalty year minus the average monthly number of individuals engaged in work in the prior year, divided by,</P>
              <P>(ii) The product of 0.15 and the average monthly number of individuals engaged in work in the prior year.</P>
              <P>(5) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, if the State fails only the two-parent participation rate specified at § 261.23, and qualifies for a penalty reduction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, its penalty reduction will be the product of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The ratio described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section computed with respect to two-parent families; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The adjustment factor described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section computed with respect to two-parent families.</P>

              <P>(6) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, if the State fails the overall <PRTPAGE P="142"/>participation rate specified at § 261.21, or both rates, and qualifies for a penalty reduction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, its penalty reduction will be the product of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The ratio described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section computed with respect to all families; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The adjustment factor described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) Pursuant to § 260.58 of this chapter, we will adjust the calculations in this section to exclude cases for which a State has granted federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If the State was not subject to a penalty the prior year, the State will receive:</P>
              <P>(i) The full applicable penalty reduction described in paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section if it failed only one participation rate; or</P>
              <P>(ii) 50 percent of the penalty reduction described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section if it failed both participation rates.</P>
              <P>(2) If the penalty year is the second successive year in which the State is subject to a penalty, the State will receive:</P>
              <P>(i) 50 percent of the applicable penalty reduction described in paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section if it failed only one participation rate; or</P>
              <P>(ii) 25 percent of the penalty reduction described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section if it failed both participation rates.</P>
              <P>(3) If the penalty year is the third or greater successive year in which the State is subject to a penalty, the State will not receive a penalty reduction described in paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) We may reduce the penalty if the State failed to achieve a participation rate because:</P>
              <P>(i) It meets the definition of a needy State, specified at § 260.30 of this chapter; or,</P>
              <P>(ii) Noncompliance is due to extraordinary circumstances such as a natural disaster, regional recession, or substantial caseload increase.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining noncompliance under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, we will consider such objective evidence of extraordinary circumstances as the State chooses to submit.</P>

              <P>(a) We will not impose a penalty under this part if we determine that the State has reasonable cause for its failure.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the general reasonable cause criteria specified at § 262.5 of this chapter, a State may also submit a request for a reasonable cause exemption from the requirement to meet the minimum participation rate in two specific case situations.</P>
              <P>(1) We will determine that a State has reasonable cause if it demonstrates that failure to meet the work participation rates is attributable to its provision of federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers (i.e., it provides evidence that it achieved the applicable work rates when individuals receiving federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers of work requirements, in accordance with the provisions at §§ 260.54(b) and 260.55 of this chapter, are removed from the calculations in §§ 261.22(b) and 261.24(b)).</P>

              <P>(c) In accordance with the procedures specified at § 262.4 of this chapter, a State may dispute our determination that it is subject to a penalty.</P>

              <P>(b) To qualify for a penalty reduction under § 262.6(j)(1) of this chapter, based <PRTPAGE P="143"/>on significant progress towards correcting a violation, a State must reduce the difference between the participation rate it achieved in the year for which it is subject to a penalty and the rate applicable during the penalty year (adjusted for any caseload reduction credit determined pursuant to subpart D of this part) by at least 50 percent.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What hours of participation may a State report for a work-eligible individual?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A State must report the actual hours that an individual participates in an activity, subject to the qualifications in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and § 261.61(c). It is not sufficient to report the hours an individual is scheduled to participate in an activity.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of calculating the work participation rates for a month, actual hours may include the hours for which an individual was paid, including paid holidays and sick leave. For participation in unpaid work activities, it may include excused absences for hours missed due to a maximum of 10 holidays in the preceding 12-month period and up to 80 hours of additional excused absences in the preceding 12-month period, no more than 16 of which may occur in a month, for each work-eligible individual. Each State must designate the days that it wishes to count as holidays for those in unpaid activities in its Work Verification Plan. It may designate no more than 10 such days. In order to count an excused absence as actual hours of participation, the individual must have been scheduled to participate in a countable work activity for the period of the absence that the State reports as participation. A State must describe its excused absence policies and definitions as part of its Work Verification Plan, specified at § 261.62.</P>
              <P>(c) For unsubsidized employment, subsidized employment, and OJT, a State may report projected actual hours of employment participation for up to six months based on current, documented actual hours of work. Any time a State receives information that the client's actual hours of work have changed, or no later than the end of any six-month period, the State must re-verify the client's current actual average hours of work, and may report these projected actual hours of participation for another six-month period.</P>
              <P>(d) A State may not count more hours toward the participation rate for a self-employed individual than the number derived by dividing the individual's self-employment income (gross income less business expenses) by the Federal minimum wage. A State may propose an alternative method of determining self-employment hours as part of its Work Verification Plan.</P>
              <P>(e) A State may count supervised homework time and up to one hour of unsupervised homework time for each hour of class time. Total homework time counted for participation cannot exceed the hours required or advised by a particular educational program.</P>

              <P>(a) A State must support each individual's hours of participation through documentation in the case file. In accordance with § 261.62, a State must describe in its Work Verification Plan the documentation it uses to verify hours of participation in each activity.</P>

              <P>(b) For an employed individual, the documentation may consist of, but is not limited to pay stubs, employer reports, or time and attendance records substantiating hours of participation. A State may presume that an employed individual participated for the <PRTPAGE P="145"/>total number of hours for which that individual was paid.</P>

              <P>(d) For an individual who is self-employed, the documentation must comport with standards set forth in the State's approved Work Verification Plan. Self-reporting by a participant without additional verification is not sufficient documentation.</P>
              <P>(e) For an individual who is not employed, the documentation for substantiating hours of participation may consist of, but is not limited to, time sheets, service provider attendance records, or school attendance records. For homework time, the State must also document the homework or study expectations of the educational program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What must a State do to verify the accuracy of its work participation information?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To ensure accuracy in the reporting of work activities by work-eligible individuals on the TANF Data Report and, if applicable, the SSP-MOE Data Report, each State must:</P>
              <P>(1) Establish and employ procedures for determining whether its work activities may count for participation rate purposes;</P>
              <P>(2) Establish and employ procedures for determining how to count and verify reported hours of work;</P>
              <P>(3) Establish and employ procedures for identifying who is a work-eligible individual;</P>

              <P>(1) For each countable work activity:</P>
              <P>(i) A description demonstrating how the activity meets the relevant definition at § 261.2;</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of how the State determines the number of countable hours of participation; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the documentation it uses to monitor participation and ensure that the actual hours of participation are reported;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the State's procedures for identifying all work-eligible individuals, as defined at § 261.2;</P>
              <P>(3) A description of how the State ensures that, for each work-eligible individual, it:</P>
              <P>(i) Accurately inputs data into the State's automated data processing system;</P>
              <P>(ii) Properly tracks the hours though the automated data processing system; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Accurately reports the hours to the Department;</P>
              <P>(4) A description of the procedures for ensuring it does not transmit to the Department a work-eligible individual's hours of participation in an activity that does not meet a Federal definition of a countable work activity; and</P>
              <P>(5) A description of the internal controls that the State has implemented to ensure a consistent measurement of the work participation rates, including the quality assurance processes and sampling specifications it uses to monitor adherence to the established work verification procedures by State staff, local staff, and contractors.</P>
              <P>(c) We will review a State's Work Verification Plan for completeness and approve it if we believe that it will result in accurate reporting of work participation information.</P>

              <P>(a) We will take action to impose a penalty under § 262.1(a)(15) of this chapter if:</P>

              <P>(b) If a State fails to submit an interim or complete Work Verification Plan by the due dates in § 261.64(a), we will reduce the SFAG payable for the immediately succeeding fiscal year by five percent of the adjusted SFAG.</P>
              <P>(c) If a State fails to maintain adequate internal controls to ensure a consistent measurement of work participation, we will reduce the adjusted SFAG by the following percentages for a fiscal year:</P>

            <P>(a) We will assess fiscal penalties against States under circumstances defined in parts 261 through 265 of this chapter. The penalties are:</P>
            <P>(1) A penalty of the amount by which a State misused its TANF funds;</P>
            <P>(2) An additional penalty of five percent of the adjusted SFAG if such misuse was intentional;</P>
            <P>(3) A penalty of four percent of the adjusted SFAG for each quarter a State fails to submit an accurate, complete and timely required report;</P>
            <P>(4) A penalty of up to 21 percent of the adjusted SFAG for failure to satisfy the minimum participation rates;</P>
            <P>(5) A penalty of no more than two percent of the adjusted SFAG for failure to participate in IEVS;</P>
            <P>(6) A penalty of no more than five percent of the adjusted SFAG for failure to enforce penalties on recipients who are not cooperating with the State Child Support Enforcement (IV-D) agency;</P>
            <P>(7) A penalty equal to the outstanding loan amount, plus interest, for failure to repay a Federal loan;</P>
            <P>(8) A penalty equal to the amount by which a State fails to meet its basic MOE requirement;</P>
            <P>(9) A penalty of five percent of the adjusted SFAG for failure to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance;</P>
            <P>(10) A penalty equal to the amount of contingency funds that were received but were not remitted for a fiscal year, if the State fails to maintain 100 percent of historic State expenditures in that fiscal year;</P>
            <P>(11) A penalty of no more than five percent of the adjusted SFAG for the failure to maintain assistance to an adult single custodial parent who cannot obtain child care for a child under age six;</P>
            <P>(12) A penalty of no more than two percent of the adjusted SFAG plus the amount a State has failed to expend of its own funds to replace the reduction to its SFAG due to the assessment of penalties in this section in the immediately succeeding fiscal year;</P>
            <P>(13) A penalty equal to the amount of the State's Welfare-to-Work formula grant for failure to meet its basic MOE requirement during a year in which it receives the formula grant;</P>
            <P>(14) A penalty of not less than one percent and not more than five percent of the adjusted SFAG for failure to impose penalties properly against individuals who refuse to engage in required work in accordance with section 407 of the Act; and</P>

            <P>(15) A penalty of not less than one percent and not more than five percent of the adjusted SFAG for failure to establish or comply with work participation verification procedures.<PRTPAGE P="148"/>
            </P>
            <P>(16)(i) A penalty of not more than five percent of the adjusted SFAG (in accordance with § 264.61(a) of this chapter), for failure to report annually on the state's implementation and maintenance of policies and practices required in § 264.60 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(ii) A penalty of not more than five percent of the adjusted SFAG (in accordance with § 264.61(b) of this chapter), for FY 2014 and each succeeding fiscal year in which the state does not demonstrate that it has implemented and maintained policies and practices required in § 264.60 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(iii) The penalty under paragraphs (a)(16)(i) and (ii) of this section may be reduced based on the degree of noncompliance of the state.</P>
            <P>(iv) Fraudulent activity by any individual receiving TANF assistance in an attempt to circumvent the policies and practices required by § 264.60 of this chapter shall not trigger a state penalty under paragraphs (a)(16)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) In the event of multiple penalties for a fiscal year, we will add all applicable penalty percentages together. We will then assess the penalty amount against the adjusted SFAG that would have been payable to the State if we had assessed no penalties. As a final step, we will subtract other (fixed) penalty amounts from the adjusted SFAG.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) We will take the penalties specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(7) of this section by reducing the SFAG payable for the quarter that immediately follows our final decision.</P>
            <P>(2) We will take the penalties specified in paragraphs (a)(3) through (6) and (8) through (16) of this section by reducing the SFAG payable for the fiscal year that immediately follows our final decision.</P>
            <P>(d) When imposing the penalties in paragraph (a) of this section, the total reduction in an affected State's quarterly SFAG amount must not exceed 25 percent. If this 25-percent limit prevents the recovery of the full penalty amount imposed on a State during a quarter or a fiscal year, as appropriate, we will apply the remaining amount of the penalty to the SFAG payable for the immediately succeeding quarter until we recover the full penalty amount.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) In the immediately succeeding fiscal year, a State must expend additional State funds to replace any reduction in the SFAG resulting from penalties.</P>
            <P>(2) The State must document compliance with this replacement provision on its TANF Financial Report (or Territorial Financial Report).</P>

            <P>(a)(1) We will use the single audit under 45 CFR part 75, subpart F, in conjunction with other reviews, audits, and data sources, as appropriate, to determine if a State is subject to a penalty for misusing Federal TANF funds (§ 263.10 of this chapter), intentionally misusing Federal TANF funds (§ 263.12 of this chapter), failing to participate in IEVS (§ 264.10 of this chapter), failing <PRTPAGE P="149"/>to comply with paternity establishment and child support requirements (§ 264.31 of this chapter), failing to maintain assistance to an adult single custodial parent who cannot obtain child care for a child under 6 (§ 261.57 of this chapter), failing to reduce assistance to a recipient who refuses without good cause to work (§ 261.54 of this chapter), and after October 1, 2007 failing to comply with work participation verification procedures (§ 261.64 of this chapter).</P>
            <P>(2) We will also use the single audit as a secondary method of determining if a State is subject to other penalties if an audit detects lack of compliance in other penalty areas.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) We will use the TANF Data Report required under part 265 of this chapter to determine if a State failed to meet participation rates (§§ 261.21 and 261.23 of this chapter) or failed to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance (§ 264.1 of this chapter).</P>
            <P>(2) Data in these reports are subject to our verification in accordance with § 265.7 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) We will use the TANF Financial Report (or, as applicable, the Territorial Financial Report) as the primary method for determining if a State has failed to meet the basic MOE requirement (§ 263.8 of this chapter), meet the Contingency Fund MOE requirement (§ 264.76 of this chapter), or replace SFAG reductions with State-only funds (§ 264.50 of this chapter).</P>

            <P>(3) Provides a corrective compliance plan, pursuant to § 262.6.</P>

            <P>(c) If we find that we determined the penalty erroneously, or that the State has adequately demonstrated that it had reasonable cause for failing to meet one or more requirements, we will not impose the penalty.<PRTPAGE P="150"/>

            <P>(f)(1)(i) We will notify the State in writing of our findings with respect to reasonable cause generally within 60 days of the date when we receive its response to our penalty notice (in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Under what general circumstances will we determine that a State has reasonable cause?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) We will not impose a penalty against a State if we determine that the State had reasonable cause for its failure. The general factors a State may use to claim reasonable cause include:</P>
            <P>(1) Natural disasters and other calamities (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, fire) whose disruptive impact was so significant as to cause the State's failure;</P>
            <P>(2) Formally issued Federal guidance that provided incorrect information resulting in the State's failure; or</P>
            <P>(3) Isolated problems of minimal impact that are not indicative of a systemic problem.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) We will grant reasonable cause to a State that:</P>
            <P>(i) Clearly demonstrates that its failure to submit complete, accurate, and timely data, as required at § 265.8 of this chapter, for one or both of the first two quarters of FY 2000, is attributable, in significant part, to its need to divert critical system resources to Year 2000 compliance activities; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Submits complete and accurate data for the first two quarters of FY 2000 by September 30, 2000.</P>
            <P>(2) A State may also use the additional factors for claiming reasonable cause for failure to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance or the minimum participation rates, as specified at §§ 261.52 and 264.3 and subpart B of part 260 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) In determining reasonable cause, we will consider the efforts the State made to meet the requirement, as well as the duration and severity of the circumstances that led to the State's failure to achieve the requirement.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) The burden of proof rests with the State to fully explain the circumstances and events that constitute reasonable cause for its failure to meet a requirement.</P>
            <P>(2) The State must provide us with sufficient relevant information and documentation to substantiate its claim of reasonable cause.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What happens if a State does not demonstrate reasonable cause?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A State may accept the penalty or enter into a corrective compliance plan that will correct or discontinue the violation in order to avoid the penalty if:</P>
            <P>(1) A State does not claim reasonable cause; or</P>
            <P>(2) We find that the State does not have reasonable cause.</P>

            <P>(b) A State that does not claim reasonable cause will have 60 days from <PRTPAGE P="151"/>receipt of our notice described in § 262.4(a) to submit its corrective compliance plan.</P>
            <P>(c) A State that unsuccessfully claimed reasonable cause will have 60 days from the date that it received our second notice, described in § 262.4(f), to submit its corrective compliance plan.</P>
            <P>(d) The corrective compliance plan must include:</P>
            <P>(1) A complete analysis of why the State did not meet the requirements;</P>
            <P>(2) A detailed description of how the State will correct or discontinue, as appropriate, the violation in a timely manner;</P>
            <P>(3) The time period in which the violation will be corrected or discontinued;</P>
            <P>(4) The milestones, including interim process and outcome goals, that the State will achieve to assure it comes into compliance within the specified time period; and</P>
            <P>(5) A certification by the Governor that the State is committed to correcting or discontinuing the violation, in accordance with the plan.</P>
            <P>(e) The corrective compliance plan must correct or discontinue the violation within the following time frames:</P>
            <P>(1) For a penalty under § 262.1(a)(4), (a)(9), or (a)(15), by the end of the first fiscal year ending at least six months after our receipt of the corrective compliance plan; and</P>
            <P>(2) For the remaining penalties, by a date the State proposes that reflects the minimum period necessary to achieve compliance.</P>
            <P>(f) During the 60-day period following our receipt of the State's corrective compliance plan, we may request additional information and consult with the State on modifications to the plan including in the case of a penalty under § 262.1(a)(15), modifications to the State's work verification procedures and Work Verification Plan.</P>
            <P>(g) We will accept or reject the State's corrective compliance plan, in writing, within 60 days of our receipt of the plan, although a corrective compliance plan is deemed to be accepted if we take no action during the 60-day period following our receipt of the plan.</P>
            <P>(h) If a State does not submit an acceptable corrective compliance plan on time, we will assess the penalty immediately.</P>
            <P>(i) We will not impose a penalty against a State with respect to any violation covered by a corrective compliance plan that we accept if the State completely corrects or discontinues, as appropriate, the violation within the period covered by the plan.</P>
            <P>(j) Under limited circumstances, we may reduce the penalty if the State fails to completely correct or discontinue the violation pursuant to its corrective compliance plan and in a timely manner. To receive a reduced penalty, the State must demonstrate that it met one or both of the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) Although it did not achieve full compliance, the State made significant progress towards correcting or discontinuing the violation; or</P>
            <P>(2) The State's failure to comply fully was attributable to either a natural disaster or regional recession.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How can a State appeal our decision to take a penalty?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) We will formally notify the Governor and the State agency of an adverse action (i.e., the reduction in the SFAG) within five days after we determine that a State is subject to a penalty under parts 261 through 265 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) Such notice will include the factual and legal basis for taking the penalty in sufficient detail for the State to be able to respond in an appeal.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The State may file an appeal of the action, in whole or in part, with the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (the Board) within 60 days after the date it receives notice of the adverse action. The State must submit its brief and supporting documents when it files its appeal.</P>
            <P>(2) The State must send a copy of the appeal, and any supplemental filings, to the Office of the General Counsel, Children, Families and Aging Division, Room 411-D, 200 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20201.</P>

            <P>(c) We will submit our reply brief and supporting documentation within 45 <PRTPAGE P="152"/>days of the receipt of the State's submission under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

            <P>(f) The Board will consider an appeal filed by a State on the basis of the documentation and briefs submitted, along with any additional information the Board may require to support a final decision. Such information may include a hearing if the Board determines that it is necessary.

            <P>(g)(1) A State may obtain judicial review of a final decision by the Board by filing an action within 90 days after the date of such decision. It should file this action with the district court of the United States in the judicial district where the State agency is located or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</P>
            <P>(2) The district court will review the final decision of the Board on the record established in the administrative proceeding, in accordance with the standards of review prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 706(2).

            <P>(a) Except as noted in § 263.2(d), the general TANF definitions at § 260.30 through § 260.33 of this chapter apply to this part.</P>
            <P>(b) The term “administrative costs” means costs necessary for the proper administration of the TANF program or separate State programs.</P>
            <P>(1) It excludes direct costs of providing program services.</P>

            <P>(i) For example, it excludes costs of providing diversion benefits and services, providing program information to clients, screening and assessments, development of employability plans, <PRTPAGE P="153"/>work activities, post-employment services, work supports, and case management. It also excludes costs for contracts devoted entirely to such activities.</P>
            <P>(ii) It excludes the salaries and benefits costs for staff providing program services and the direct administrative costs associated with providing the services, such as the costs for supplies, equipment, travel, postage, utilities, rental of office space and maintenance of office space.</P>
            <P>(2) It includes costs for general administration and coordination of these programs, including contract costs and all indirect (or overhead) costs. Examples of administrative costs include:</P>
            <P>(i) Salaries and benefits of staff performing administrative and coordination functions;</P>
            <P>(ii) Activities related to eligibility determinations;</P>
            <P>(iii) Preparation of program plans, budgets, and schedules;</P>

              <SUBJECT>How much State money must a State expend annually to meet the basic MOE requirement?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The minimum basic MOE for a fiscal year is 80 percent of a State's historic State expenditures.</P>
              <P>(2) However, if a State meets the minimum work participation rate requirements in a fiscal year, as required under §§ 261.21 and 261.23 of this chapter, after adjustment for any caseload reduction credit under § 261.41 of this chapter, then the minimum basic MOE for that fiscal year is 75 percent of the State's historic State expenditures.</P>
              <P>(3) A State that does not meet the minimum participation rate requirements in a fiscal year, as required under §§ 261.21 and 261.23 of this chapter (after adjustment for any caseload reduction credit under § 261.41 of this chapter), but which is granted full or partial penalty relief for that fiscal year, must still meet the minimum basic MOE specified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The basic MOE level also depends on whether a Tribe or consortium of Tribes residing in a State has received approval to operate its own TANF program. The State's basic MOE level for a fiscal year will be reduced by the same percentage as we reduced the SFAG as the result of any Tribal Family Assistance Grants awarded to Tribal grantees in the State for that year.</P>

              <P>(a) Expenditures of State funds in TANF or separate State programs may count if they are made for the following types of benefits or services:</P>
              <P>(1) Cash assistance, including the State's share of the assigned child support collection that is distributed to the family, and disregarded in determining eligibility for, and amount of the TANF assistance payment;</P>
              <P>(2) Child care assistance (see § 263.3);</P>

              <P>(3) Education activities designed to increase self-sufficiency, job training, and work (see § 263.4);<PRTPAGE P="154"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Any other use of funds allowable under section 404(a)(1) of the Act including:</P>
              <P>(i) Nonmedical treatment services for alcohol and drug abuse and some medical treatment services (provided that the State has not commingled its MOE funds with Federal TANF funds to pay for the services), if consistent with the goals at § 260.20 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Pro-family healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood activities enumerated in part IV-A of the Act, sections 403(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 403(a)(2)(C)(ii) that are consistent with the goals at § 260.20(c) or (d) of this chapter, but do not constitute “assistance” as defined in § 260.31(a) of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(5)(i) Administrative costs for activities listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, not to exceed 15 percent of the total amount of countable expenditures for the fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(ii) Costs for information technology and computerization needed for tracking or monitoring required by or under part IV-A of the Act do not count towards the limit in paragraph (5)(i) of this section, even if they fall within the definition of “administrative costs.”</P>
              <P>(A) This exclusion covers the costs for salaries and benefits of staff who develop, maintain, support, or operate the portions of information technology or computer systems used for tracking and monitoring.</P>
              <P>(B) It also covers the costs of contracts for the development, maintenance, support, or operation of those portions of information technology or computer systems used for tracking or monitoring.</P>
              <P>(b) With the exception of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, the benefits or services listed under paragraph (a) of this section count only if they have been provided to or on behalf of eligible families. An “eligible family” as defined by the State, must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be comprised of citizens or non-citizens who:</P>
              <P>(i) Are eligible for TANF assistance;</P>
              <P>(ii) Would be eligible for TANF assistance, but for the time limit on the receipt of federally funded assistance; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Are lawfully present in the United States and would be eligible for assistance, but for the application of title IV of PRWORA;</P>
              <P>(2) Include a child living with a custodial parent or other adult caretaker relative (or consist of a pregnant individual); and</P>
              <P>(3) Be financially eligible according to the appropriate income and resource (when applicable) standards established by the State and contained in its TANF plan.</P>
              <P>(c) Benefits or services listed under paragraph (a) of this section provided to a family that meets the criteria under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, but who became ineligible solely due to the time limitation given under § 264.1 of this chapter, may also count.</P>
              <P>(d) Expenditures for the benefits or services listed under paragraph (a) of this section count whether or not the benefit or service meets the definition of assistance under § 260.31 of this chapter. Further, families that meet the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section are considered to be eligible for TANF assistance for the purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Expenditures for benefits or services listed under paragraph (a) of this section may include allowable costs borne by others in the State (e.g., local government), including cash donations from non-Federal third parties (e.g., a non-profit organization) and the value of third party in-kind contributions if:</P>
              <P>(1) The expenditure is verifiable and meets all applicable requirements in 45 CFR 75.2 and 75.306;</P>
              <P>(2) There is an agreement between the State and the other party allowing the State to count the expenditure toward its MOE requirement; and,</P>
              <P>(3) The State counts a cash donation only when it is actually spent.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What restrictions apply to the length of time Federal TANF assistance may be provided?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Subject to the exceptions in this section, no State may use any of its Federal TANF funds to provide assistance (as defined in § 260.31 of this chapter) to a family that includes an adult head-of-household or a spouse of the head-of-household who has received Federal assistance for a total of five years (i.e., 60 cumulative months, whether or not consecutive).</P>
              <P>(2) The provision in paragraph (a)(1) of this section also applies to a family that includes a pregnant minor head-of-household, minor parent head-of-household, or spouse of such a head-of-household who has received Federal assistance for a total of five years.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a State may provide assistance under WtW, pursuant to section 403(a)(5) of the Act, to a family that is ineligible for TANF solely because it has reached the five-year time limit.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) States must not count toward the five-year limit:<PRTPAGE P="160"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Any month of receipt of assistance by an individual who is not the head-of-household or married to the head-of-household;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any month of receipt of assistance by an adult while living in Indian country (as defined in section 1151 of title 18, United States Code) or a Native Alaskan Village where at least 50 percent of the adults were not employed; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any month for which an individual receives only noncash assistance provided under WtW, pursuant to section 403(a)(5) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) Only months of assistance that are paid for with Federal TANF funds (in whole or in part) count towards the five-year time limit.</P>
              <P>(c) States have the option to extend assistance paid for by Federal TANF funds beyond the five-year limit for up to 20 percent of the average monthly number of families receiving assistance during the fiscal year or the immediately preceding fiscal year, whichever the State elects. States are permitted to extend assistance to families only on the basis of:</P>
              <P>(1) Hardship, as defined by the State; or</P>
              <P>(2) The fact that the family includes someone who has been battered, or subject to extreme cruelty based on the fact that the individual has been subjected to:</P>
              <P>(i) Physical acts that resulted in, or threatened to result in, physical injury to the individual;</P>
              <P>(ii) Sexual abuse;</P>
              <P>(iii) Sexual activity involving a dependent child;</P>
              <P>(iv) Being forced as the caretaker relative of a dependent child to engage in nonconsensual sexual acts or activities;</P>
              <P>(v) Threats of, or attempts at, physical or sexual abuse;</P>
              <P>(vi) Mental abuse; or</P>
              <P>(vii) Neglect or deprivation of medical care.</P>
              <P>(d) If a State opts to extend assistance to part of its caseload as permitted under paragraph (c) of this section, it would grant such an extension to a specific family once a head-of-household or spouse of a head-of-household in the family has received 60 cumulative months of assistance.</P>
              <P>(e) To determine whether a State has failed to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance established in paragraph (c) of this section for a fiscal year, we would divide the average monthly number of families with a head-of-household or a spouse of a head-of-household who has received assistance for more than 60 cumulative months by the average monthly number of all families that received assistance during that fiscal year or during the immediately preceding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(f) If the five-year limit is inconsistent with a State's waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act, we will determine State compliance with the Federal time limit in accordance with the provisions of subpart C of part 260.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 264.2</SECTNO>

              <P>If we determine that a State has not complied with the requirements of § 264.1, we will reduce the SFAG payable to the State for the immediately succeeding fiscal year by five percent of the adjusted SFAG unless the State demonstrates to our satisfaction that it had reasonable cause, or it corrects or discontinues the violation under an approved corrective compliance plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How can a State avoid a penalty for failure to comply with the five-year limit?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) We will not impose the penalty if the State demonstrates to our satisfaction that it had reasonable cause for failing to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance or it achieves compliance under a corrective compliance plan, pursuant to §§ 262.5 and 262.6 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition, we will determine a State has reasonable cause if it demonstrates that it failed to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance because of federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers provided to victims of domestic violence in accordance with provisions of subpart B of part 260.</P>

              <P>(a) Pursuant to section 1137 of the Act and subject to paragraph (a)(2) of that section, States must meet the requirements of IEVS and request the following information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the State Wage Information Collections Agency (SWICA), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS):</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The State agency must refer all appropriate individuals in the family of a child, for whom paternity has not been established or for whom a child support order needs to be established, modified or enforced, to the child support enforcement agency (i.e., the IV-D agency).</P>
              <P>(2) Referred individuals must cooperate in establishing paternity and in establishing, modifying, or enforcing a support order with respect to the child.</P>
              <P>(b) If the IV-D agency determines that an individual is not cooperating, and the individual does not qualify for a good cause or other exception established by the State agency responsible for making good cause determinations in accordance with section 454(29) of the Act or for a good cause domestic violence waiver granted in accordance with § 260.52 of this chapter, then the IV-D agency must notify the IV-A agency promptly.</P>
              <P>(c) The IV-A agency must then take appropriate action by:</P>
              <P>(1) Deducting from the assistance that would otherwise be provided to the family of the individual an amount equal to not less than 25 percent of the amount of such assistance; or</P>

              <P>(a)(1) If we find that, for a fiscal year, the State IV-A agency did not enforce the penalties against recipients required under § 264.30(c), we will reduce the SFAG payable for the next fiscal year by one percent of the adjusted SFAG.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon a finding for a second fiscal year, we will reduce the SFAG by two percent of the adjusted SFAG for the following year.</P>
              <P>(3) A third or subsequent finding will result in the maximum penalty of five percent.</P>
              <P>(b) We will not impose a penalty if:</P>
              <P>(1) The State demonstrates to our satisfaction that it had reasonable cause pursuant to § 262.5 of this chapter; or</P>
              <P>(2) The State achieves compliance under a corrective compliance plan pursuant to § 262.6 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(1) The entire outstanding loan balance, plus all accumulated interest, becomes due and payable immediately; and</P>

              <P>(2) We will reduce the SFAG payable for the immediately succeeding fiscal <PRTPAGE P="162"/>year quarter by the outstanding loan amount plus interest.</P>
              <P>(b) Neither the reasonable cause provisions at § 262.5 of this chapter nor the corrective compliance plan provisions at § 262.6 of this chapter apply when a State fails to repay a Federal loan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What happens if, in a fiscal year, a State does not expend, with its own funds, an amount equal to the reduction to the adjusted SFAG resulting from a penalty?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) When we withhold Federal TANF funds from a State during a fiscal year because of other penalty actions listed at § 262.1 of this chapter, the State must replace these Federal TANF funds with State funds during the subsequent fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(2) If the State fails to replace funds during the subsequent year, then we will assess an additional penalty of no more than two percent of the adjusted SFAG during the year that follows the subsequent year.</P>
              <P>(b) A State must expend such replacement funds under its TANF program, not under “separate State programs.”</P>
              <P>(c) We will assess a penalty of no more than two percent of the adjusted SFAG plus the amount equal to the difference between the amount the State was required to expend and the amount it actually expended in the fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(1) We will assess the maximum penalty amount if the State made no additional expenditures to compensate for the reductions to its adjusted SFAG resulting from penalties.</P>
              <P>(2) We will reduce the percentage portion of the penalty if the State has expended some of the amount required. In such case, we will calculate the applicable percentage portion of the penalty by multiplying the percentage of the required expenditures that the State failed to make in the fiscal year by two percent.</P>
              <P>(d) The reasonable cause and corrective compliance plan provisions at §§ 262.5 and 262.6 of this chapter do not apply to this penalty.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Measures of participation by low-income working households in the Food Stamp Program</E>—(1) <E T="03">Food Stamp absolute measure.</E> (i) Beginning in FY 2002, we will measure the number of low-income working households with children (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> households with children under age 18 which have an income less than 130 percent of poverty and earnings equal to at least half-time, full-year minimum wage) receiving Food Stamps as a percentage of the number of low-income working households with children (as defined in this paragraph) in the State.</P>
            <P>(ii) We will rank all States that choose to compete on this measure and will award bonuses to the three States with the highest scores. We will calculate the percentage rate for this measure to two decimal points. If two or more States have the same percentage rate for the measure, we will calculate the rates for these States to as many decimal points as necessary to eliminate the tie.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Food Stamp improvement measure.</E> (i) Beginning in FY 2002, we will measure the improvement in the number of low-income working households with children (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> households with children under age 18 which have an income less than 130 percent of poverty and earnings equal to at least half-time, full-year Federal minimum wage) receiving Food Stamps as a percentage of the number of low-income working households with children (as defined in this subparagraph) in the State.</P>
            <P>(ii) For any given year, we will compare a State's performance on this measure to its performance in the previous year, beginning with a comparison of calendar (CY) 2000 to CY 2001, based on Census Bureau decennial and annual demographic program data.</P>

            <P>(iii) We will rank all States that choose to compete on this measure and will award bonuses to the seven States with the greatest percentage point improvement in this measure. We will calculate the percentage rate for this <PRTPAGE P="174"/>measure to two decimal points. If two or more States have the same percentage rate for this measure, we will calculate the rates for these States to as many decimal points as necessary to eliminate the tie.</P>

            <P>(d) Measures of participation by low-income families in the Medicaid/SCHIP Programs. (1) <E T="03">Medicaid/SCHIP absolute measure.</E> (i) Beginning in FY 2002, we will measure the number of individuals receiving TANF benefits who are also enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP, who leave TANF in a fiscal year and are enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP in the fourth month after leaving TANF assistance, and who are not receiving TANF assistance in the fourth month as a percentage of individuals who left TANF in the fiscal year and are not receiving TANF assistance in the fourth month after leaving.</P>
            <P>(ii) We will rank the performance of each State that chooses to compete on this absolute measure and award bonuses to the three States with the highest scores.</P>
            <P>(iii) We will calculate the percentage rate for this measure to two decimal points. If two or more States have the same percentage rate for this measure, we will calculate the rates for these States to as many decimal points as necessary to eliminate the tie.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Medicaid/SCHIP improvement measure.</E> (i) Beginning in FY 2002, we will measure the improvement in the number of individuals receiving TANF benefits who are also enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP, who leave TANF in a fiscal year and are enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP in the fourth month after leaving TANF assistance, and who are not receiving TANF assistance in the fourth month as a percentage of individuals who left TANF in the fiscal year and are not receiving TANF assistance in the fourth month after leaving.</P>
            <P>(ii) For any given year, we will compare a State's performance on this improvement measure to its performance in the previous year, beginning with a comparison of FY 2000 to FY 2001, based on a quarterly submission by the State as determined by matching individuals (adults and children) who have left TANF assistance and who are not receiving TANF assistance in the fourth month with Medicaid or SCHIP enrollment data.</P>
            <P>(iii) We will rank the performance of all States that choose to compete on this improvement measure and will award bonuses to the seven States with the greatest percentage point improvement in this measure.</P>
            <P>(iv) We will calculate the percentage rate for the measure to two decimal points. If two or more States have the same percentage rate for this measure, we will calculate the rates for these States to as many decimal points as necessary to eliminate the tie.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Child care subsidy measure.</E> (1) Beginning in FY 2002, we will measure State performance based upon a composite ranking of:</P>
            <P>(i) The accessibility of services based on the percentage of children in the State who meet the maximum allowable Federal eligibility requirements for the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) who are served by the State during the performance year, and who are included in the data reported on the ACF-800 and ACF-801 for the same fiscal year; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The affordability of CCDF services based on a comparison of the reported assessed family co-payment to reported family income and a comparison of the number of eligible children under the State's defined income limits to the number of eligible children under the federal eligibility limits.</P>
            <P>(2) Beginning in FY 2003, we will measure State performance based upon a composite ranking of:</P>
            <P>(i) The two components described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The quality of CCDF services based on a comparison of reimbursement rates during the performance year to the market rates, determined in accordance with 45 CFR 98.43(b)(2), applicable to that year.</P>
            <P>(3) For the affordability component in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, we will compare family income to the assessed State family co-payment as reported on the ACF-801 across four income ranges. These income ranges refer to percentages of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for a family of three persons. The income ranges are as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Income below the poverty level;<PRTPAGE P="175"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Income at least 100 percent and below 125 percent of poverty;</P>
            <P>(iii) Income at least 125 percent and below 150 percent of poverty; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Income at least 150 percent and below 175 percent of poverty.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) For the affordability component, we will calculate, for each income range, the average of the ratios of family co-payment to family income for each family served; and</P>
            <P>(ii) We will calculate a ratio of the number of children eligible under the State's defined income limits compared to the number of children eligible under the Federal eligibility limits in the CCDF, i.e., 85 percent of the State's median income.</P>
            <P>(iii) We will rank each State based on each of the four averages calculated in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section and the ratio calculated in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section and combine the ranks to obtain the State's score on this component.</P>
            <P>(5) For the quality component specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, in FY 2003 and beyond, we will compare the actual rates paid by the State as reported on the ACF-801 (not the published maximum rates) to the market rates applicable to the performance year, i.e., FY 2002. Each State competing on this measure must submit the following data as a part of its market rate survey:</P>
            <P>(i) Age-specific rates for children 0-13 years of age reported by the child care centers and family day care homes responding to the State's market rate survey; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The provider's county or, if the State uses multi-county regions to measure market rates or set maximum payment rates, the administrative region.</P>
            <P>(6) For the quality component, we will compute the percentile of the market represented by the amount paid for each child as reported on the ACF-801 by comparing the actual payment for each child to the array of reported market rates for children of the same age in the relevant county or administrative region. (We will compare payments for children in center-based care to reported center care provider rates. We will compare payments for children in non-center-based care, i.e., family day care and unlicensed child care, to reported family child care provider rates.)</P>
            <P>(i) We will take the percentile that results from the per-child comparison of the actual payment to the reported market rates and compute separate State-wide averages for center-based and non-center-based care; and</P>
            <P>(ii) We will rank the State according to the two State-wide averages and combine the ranks to obtain the State's score on this component.</P>
            <P>(7) For any given year, we will rank the States that choose to compete on the child care measure on each component of the overall measure and award bonuses to the ten States with the highest composite rankings.</P>
            <P>(8) We will calculate each component score for this measure to two decimal points. If two or more States have the same score for a component, we will calculate the scores for these States to as many decimal points as necessary to eliminate the tie.</P>
            <P>(9)(i) The rank of the measure for the FY 2002 bonus year will be a composite weighted score of the two components at paragraph (e)(1) of this section, with the component at paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section having a weight of 6 and the component at paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section having a weight of 4.</P>
            <P>(ii) The rank of the measure for the bonus beginning in FY 2003 will be a composite weighted score of the three components at paragraph (e)(2) of this section, with the component at paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section having a weight of 5, the component at paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section having a weight of 3, and the component at paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section having a weight of 2.</P>
            <P>(10) We will award bonuses only to the top ten qualifying States that have fully obligated their CCDF Matching Funds for the fiscal year corresponding to the performance year and fully expended their CCDF Matching Funds for the fiscal year preceding the performance year.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Family formation and stability measure.</E> (1) Beginning in FY 2002 and beyond, we will measure the increase in the percent of children in each State who reside in married couple families, beginning with a comparison of CY 2000 <PRTPAGE P="176"/>and CY 2001 data from the Census Bureau. For any given subsequent year we will compare a State's performance on this measure to its performance in the previous year.</P>
            <P>(2) We will rank the performance of those States that choose to compete on this measure and will award bonuses to the ten States with the greatest percentage point improvement in this measure.</P>
            <P>(3) We will calculate the percentage rate for the measure to two decimal points. If two or more States have the same percentage rate for this measure, we will calculate the rates for these States to as many decimal points as necessary to eliminate the tie.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Option to compete.</E> Each State has the option to compete on one, any number of, or none of the measures specified in this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What factors will we use to determine a State's score on the work measures?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The work measures are defined as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The <E T="03">Job Entry</E> Rate means the unduplicated number of adult recipients who entered employment for the first time in the performance year (job entries) as a percentage of the total unduplicated number of adult recipients unemployed at some point in the performance year.</P>
            <P>(2) The <E T="03">Success in the Work Force Rate</E> is composed of two equally weighted sub-measures defined as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) The <E T="03">Job Retention Rate</E> means the performance year sum of the unduplicated number of employed adult recipients in each quarter one through four who were also employed in the first and second subsequent quarters, as a percentage of the sum of the unduplicated number of employed adult recipients in each quarter. (At some point, the adult might become a former recipient.); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The <E T="03">Earnings Gain Rate</E> means the performance year sum of the gain in earnings between the initial and second subsequent quarter in each of quarters one through four for adult recipients employed in both these quarters as a percentage of the sum of their initial earnings in each of quarters one through four. (At some point, the adult might become a former recipient.)</P>
            <P>(3) The <E T="03">Increase in the Job Entry Rate</E> means the positive percentage point difference between the job entry rate for the performance year and the job entry rate for the comparison year; and</P>
            <P>(4) The Increase in Success in the Work Force Rate means the positive percentage point difference on at least one sub-measure between the success in the work force rate for the performance year and the success in the work force rate for the comparison year. It is composed of two equally weighted sub-measures defined as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) The <E T="03">Increase in the Job Retention Rate</E> means the percentage point difference between the job retention rate for the performance year and the job retention rate for the comparison year; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The <E T="03">Increase in the Earning Gain Rate</E> means the percentage point difference between the earnings gain rate for the performance year and the earnings gain rate for the comparison year.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Ranking of States.</E> (1) We will measure State performance in the work measures over the course of an entire fiscal year both for the performance year and the comparison year, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) We will rank the competing States on the work measures for which they:</P>
            <P>(i) Indicate they wish to compete; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Submit the data specified in § 270.6 within the time frames specified in § 270.11.</P>

            <P>(3) We will rank the States on absolute performance in each of the work measures in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. For each of the work measures in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, we will rank States based on the percentage point change <PRTPAGE P="177"/>in their improvement rate in the performance year compared to the comparison year. The rank of the performance in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) of this section will be a composite score of the rank of the job retention and the earnings gain measures.</P>
            <P>(4) We will calculate the percentage rate for each work measure to two decimal points. If two or more States have the same absolute or improvement rate for a specific work measure, we will calculate the rates for these States to as many decimal points as necessary to eliminate the tie.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What steps will we follow to award the bonus?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) For each of the fiscal years 1999 through 2002, we will:</P>
            <P>(1) Based on the vital statistics data provided by NCHS as described in § 283.4, calculate the ratios for the most recent two years for which final birth data are available, and for the prior two years, as described in § 283.5;</P>
            <P>(2) Calculate the proportionate change between these two ratios, as described in § 283.5.</P>
            <P>(3) Identify as potentially eligible a maximum of eight States, i.e., Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, and five other States, that have qualifying decreases in their ratios, using the methodology described in § 283.5;</P>
            <P>(4) Notify these potentially eligible States that we will consider them for the bonus if they submit data on abortions as stated in § 283.6; and</P>
            <P>(5) Identify which of the potentially eligible States that submitted the required data on abortions have experienced decreases in their rates of abortion relative to 1995, as described in § 283.7. These States will receive the bonus.</P>
            <P>(b) We will determine the amount of the grant for each eligible State, based on the number of eligible States, and whether Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands are eligible. No State will receive a bonus award greater than $25 million in any year.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 283.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>If a State wants to be considered for bonus eligibility, what birth data must it submit?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be considered for a bonus, the State must have submitted data on out-of-wedlock births as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The State must have submitted to NCHS the final vital statistics data files for all births occurring in the State. These files must show, among other elements, the total number of live births and the total number of out-of-wedlock live births occurring in the State. These data must conform to the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program contract for all years in the calculation period. This contract specifies, among other things, the guidelines and time-lines for submitting vital statistics data files; and</P>
            <P>(2) The State must have submitted these data for the most recent two years for which NCHS reports final data, as well as for the previous two years.</P>
            <P>(b) If a State has changed its method of determining marital status for the purposes of these data, the State also must have met the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) The State has identified all years for which the method of determining marital status is different from that used for the previous year;</P>
            <P>(2) For those years identified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State has either:</P>
            <P>(i) Replicated as closely as possible a consistent method for determining marital status at the time of birth, and the State has reported to NCHS the resulting alternative number of out-of-wedlock births; or</P>

            <P>(ii) If NCHS agrees that such replication is not methodologically feasible, the State may chose to accept an NCHS estimate of what the alternative number would be;<PRTPAGE P="181"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The State has submitted documentation to NCHS on what changes occurred in the determination of marital status for those years and, if appropriate, how it determined the alternative number of out-of-wedlock births for the State; and</P>
            <P>(4) For methodological changes that were implemented prior to 1998 and applicable to data collected for the bonus period, the State has submitted the information described in paragraphs (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section within two months after April 14, 1999. For such changes implemented during or after 1998, the State must submit such information either by the end of calendar year 1999 or according to the same deadline that applies to its vital statistics data for that year, whichever is later.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 283.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How will we use these birth data to determine bonus eligibility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) We will base eligibility determinations on final vital statistics data provided by NCHS showing the number of out-of-wedlock live births and the number of total live births among women living in each State and a factor provided by NCHS to adjust for changes in data reporting for those States that have changed their methodology for collecting data on out-of-wedlock births during the bonus period.</P>
            <P>(b) We will use the number of total live births and the number of out-of-wedlock births, adjusted for any changes in data collection or reporting, to calculate the decrease in the ratio of out-of-wedlock to total births for each State as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) We will calculate the ratio as the number of out-of-wedlock births for the State during the most recent two-year period for which NCHS has final birth data divided by the number of total births for the State during the same period. We will calculate, to three decimal places, the ratio for each State that submits the necessary data on total and out-of-wedlock births described in § 283.4.</P>
            <P>(2) We will calculate the ratio for the previous two-year period using the same methodology.</P>
            <P>(3) We will calculate the proportionate change in the ratio as the ratio of out-of-wedlock births to total births for the most recent two-year period minus the ratio of out-of-wedlock births to total births from the prior two-year period, all divided by the ratio of out-of-wedlock births to total births for the prior two-year period. A negative number will indicate a decrease in the ratio and a positive number will indicate an increase in the ratio.</P>
            <P>(c) We will identify which States have a decrease in their ratios large enough to make them potentially eligible for the bonus, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) For States other than Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands, we will use this calculated change to rank the States and identify which five States have the largest decrease in their ratios. Only States among the top five will be potentially eligible for the bonus. We will identify fewer than five such States as potentially eligible if fewer than five experience decreases in their ratios. We will not include Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands in this ranking.</P>
            <P>(2) If we identify more than five States due to a tie in the decrease, we will recalculate the ratio and the decrease in the ratio to as many decimal places as necessary to eliminate the tie. We will identify no more than five States.</P>
            <P>(3) For Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands, we will use the calculated change in the ratio to identify which of these States experienced a decrease that is either at least as large as the smallest qualifying decrease identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or a decrease that ranks within the top five decreases when all States and Territories are ranked together. These identified States will be potentially eligible for the bonus also.</P>
            <P>(4) We will notify the potentially eligible States, as identified under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section that they must submit the information on abortions specified under § 283.6 if they want to be considered for the bonus.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <PRTPAGE P="182"/>
            <SECTNO>§ 283.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>If a State wants to be considered for bonus eligibility, what data on abortions must it submit?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be considered further for bonus eligibility, each potentially eligible State, as identified under § 283.5, must submit to ACF data and information on the number of abortions for calendar year 1995 within two months of this notification. This number must measure either of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) For calendar year 1995, the total number of abortions performed by all providers within the State; or</P>
            <P>(2) For calendar year 1995, the total number of abortions performed by all providers within the State on the total population of State residents only. This is the preferred measure.</P>
            <P>(b) States must have obtained these data on abortions for calendar year 1995 within 60 days of publication of the final rule and must include with their submission of 1995 data an official record documenting when they obtained the abortion data.</P>
            <P>(c) Within two months of notification by ACF of potential eligibility, the State must submit:</P>
            <P>(1) The number of abortions performed for the most recent year for which abortion data are available (as defined in § 283.2 to mean the year that is two calendar years prior to the current calendar year). In measuring the number of abortions, the State must use the same definition, either under paragraph (a)(1) or paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for both 1995 and the most recent year; or</P>
            <P>(2) If applicable, the adjusted number and information specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) If the State's data collection or reporting methodology changed between 1995 and the bonus year in such a way as to reflect an increase or decrease in the number of abortions that is different than what actually occurred during the period, the State must:</P>
            <P>(1) When submitting the number of abortions for the most recent year under paragraph (c)(2), adjust the number to exclude increases or decreases in the number due to changes in methodology for collecting or reporting the data. For example, this calculation should include adjustments for increases or decreases in response rates for providers in reporting abortion data;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide a rationale for the adjustment, i.e., a description of how the data collection or reporting methodology was changed. This could include a description of how legislative, policy or procedural changes affected the collection or reporting of abortion data, or an indication of changes in the response rate of providers in reporting abortion data; and</P>
            <P>(3) Provide a certification by the Governor, or his or her designee, that the number of abortions reported to ACF accurately reflects these adjustments for changes in data collection or reporting methodology.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 283.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How will we use these data on abortions to determine bonus eligibility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) For those States that have met all the requirements under §§ 283.1 through 283.6, we will calculate the rate of abortions for calendar year 1995 and for the most recent year for which abortion data are available as defined in § 283.2. These rates will equal the number of abortions reported by the State to ACF for the applicable year, divided by total live births among women living in the State reported by NCHS for the same year. We will calculate the rates to three decimal places.</P>
            <P>(b) If ACF determines that the State's rate of abortions for the most recent year for which abortion data are available is less than the rate for 1995, and, if the State has met all the requirements listed elsewhere under this part, the State will receive the bonus.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What will be the amount of the bonus?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If, for a bonus year, none of the eligible States is Guam, American Samoa or the Virgin Islands, then the amount of the grant shall be:</P>
            <P>(1) $20 million per State if there are five eligible States; or</P>
            <P>(2) $25 million per State if there are fewer than five eligible States.</P>

            <P>(b) If for a bonus year, Guam, the Virgin Islands, or American Samoa is an eligible State, then the amount of the grant shall be:<PRTPAGE P="183"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) In the case of such a State, 25 percent of the mandatory ceiling amount as defined in section 1108 of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of any other State, $100 million, minus the total amount of any bonuses paid to Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, and divided by the number of eligible States other than Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands, not to exceed $25 million per State.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 283.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What do eligible States need to know to access and use the bonus funds?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) States must use the bonus funds to carry out the purposes of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant in section 401 and 404 of the Act. This may include statewide programs to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies.</P>
            <P>(b) As applicable, these funds are subject to the requirements in, and the limitations of, sections 404 and 408 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) For Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, the bonus award funds are not subject to the mandatory ceilings on funding established in section 1108(c)(4) of the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What information will we use to determine the child poverty rate in each State?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> We will determine the child poverty rate in each State based on estimates from either the Census Bureau or the State, as described in this section. Each year we will use these data to determine the change in the State's child poverty rate over a two-year period, beginning with calendar years 1996 and 1997.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Estimates from the Census Bureau.</E> (1) Annually, we will obtain from the Census Bureau and provide to each State the estimate of the number and percentage of children in poverty in each State. The estimate will be based on the Census Bureau methodology.</P>
            <P>(2) In 2000, and annually thereafter, we will determine for each State, at the 90-percent confidence level, the percentage change in the child poverty rate and provide this information to the State. The determination of percentage change in 2000 will cover the change between calendar years 1996 and 1997.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Estimates from the State.</E> (1) As an alternative to the Census Bureau estimates provided to the State under paragraph (b) of this section, the State may provide to us data on child poverty in the State derived from an independent source.</P>
            <P>(2) If the State provides data on child poverty as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must:</P>
            <P>(i) Provide an estimate of the child poverty rate for the same two calendar years as the Census Bureau estimates provided to the State under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide the change in the child poverty rate for the applicable two-calendar-year period at the 90-percent confidence level;</P>
            <P>(iii) Use the official definition of poverty as used by the Census Bureau; and</P>

            <P>(iv) Describe the methodology used to develop its independent estimates, the sources of data and methodology <PRTPAGE P="185"/>for collecting the data, any known problems associated with making estimates of this type, the estimate of the standard error, and the power of the sample to detect a five percent change in the child poverty rate.</P>
            <P>(3) The State must submit its independent estimates and supporting information within 45 days of the date the State receives the Census Bureau estimates as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of the State's child poverty rate.</E> (1) If we determine that the State's independent estimates of the child poverty rate are more reliable than the Census Bureau estimates, we will accept these estimates.</P>

            <P>(1) Conclude that the State has satisfied the statutory requirements of section 413(i) of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(2) Notify the State that no further information from or action by the State is required for the applicable two-calendar-year period.</P>

Relevant information may include, but is not limited to, Census Bureau data, data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, data from other Federal programs, and Tribal records. In such a case, we will use the data submitted by the Tribe to assist us in determining the amount of the TFAG. Where there are inconsistencies in the data, follow-up discussions with the Tribe and the State will ensue.</P>
              <P>(b) We will share the data submitted by the State under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section with the Tribe.

              <P>(1) Will the Tribe impose a pro rata reduction, or more at Tribal option, or will it terminate assistance to a family?</P>
              <P>(2) After consideration of the provision specified at § 286.150, what will be the proposed Tribal policies related to a single custodial parent, with a child under the age of 6, who refuses to engage in work activities because of a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care?</P>

              <SUBJECT>What special provisions apply to victims of domestic violence?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Tribes electing the Family Violence Option (FVO) must certify that they have established and are enforcing standards and procedures to:</P>
              <P>(1) Screen and identify individuals receiving TANF assistance with a history of domestic violence, while maintaining the confidentiality of such individuals;</P>
              <P>(2) Refer such individuals to counseling and supportive services; and</P>
              <P>(3) Provide waivers, pursuant to a determination of good cause, of TANF program requirements to such individuals for so long as necessary in cases where compliance would make it more difficult for such individuals to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize those who are or have been victimized by such violence or who are at risk of further domestic violence.</P>
              <P>(b) Tribes have broad flexibility to grant waivers of TANF program requirements, but such waivers must:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify the specific program requirement being waived;</P>
              <P>(2) Be granted based on need as determined by an individualized assessment by a person trained in domestic violence and redeterminations no less than every six months;</P>
              <P>(3) Be accompanied by an appropriate services plan that:</P>

              <P>(i) Is developed in coordination with a person trained in domestic violence;<PRTPAGE P="201"/>
              </P>

              <P>(c) If a Tribe wants us to take waivers that it grants under this section into account in deciding if it has reasonable cause for failing to meet its work participation rates or comply with the established time limit on TANF assistance, has achieved compliance or made significant progress towards achieving compliance with such requirements during a corrective compliance period, the waivers must comply with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) We will determine that a Tribe has reasonable cause for failing to meet its work participation rates or to comply with established time limits on assistance if—</P>
              <P>(1) Such failures were attributable to good cause domestic violence waivers granted to victims of domestic violence;</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of work participation rates, the Tribe provides evidence that it achieved the applicable rates except with respect to any individuals who received a domestic violence waiver of work participation requirements. In other words, the Tribe must demonstrate that it met the applicable rates when such waiver cases are removed from the calculation of work participation rate;</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of established time limits on assistance, the Tribe provides evidence that it granted good cause domestic violence waivers to extend time limits based on the need for continued assistance due to current or past domestic violence or the risk of further domestic violence, and individuals and their families receiving assistance beyond the established time limit under such waivers do not exceed 20 percent of the total number of families receiving assistance.</P>
              <P>(e) We may take good cause domestic violence waivers of work participation or waivers which extend the established time limits for assistance into consideration in deciding whether a Tribe has achieved compliance or made significant progress toward achieving compliance during a corrective compliance period.</P>

              <P>(1) Appropriate child care within a reasonable distance from the home or work site is unavailable;</P>
              <P>(2) Informal child care by a relative or under other arrangements is unavailable or unsuitable; or</P>

              <P>(c) The Tribe will determine when the individual has demonstrated that he or she cannot find child care, in accordance with criteria established by the Tribe. These criteria must:</P>
              <P>(1) Address the procedures that the Tribe uses to determine if the parent has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care;</P>

              <SUBJECT>What penalties will apply to Tribes?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Tribes will be subject to fiscal penalties and requirements as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If we determine that a Tribe misused its Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds, including providing assistance beyond the Tribe's negotiated time limit under § 286.115, we will reduce the TFAG for the following fiscal year by the amount so used;</P>
              <P>(2) If we determine that a Tribe intentionally misused its TFAG for an unallowable purpose, the TFAG for the following fiscal year will be reduced by an additional five percent;</P>
              <P>(3) If we determine that a Tribe failed to meet the minimum work participation rate(s) established for the Tribe, the TFAG for the following fiscal year will be reduced. The amount of the reduction will depend on whether the Tribe was under a penalty for this reason in the preceding year. If not, the penalty reduction will be a maximum of five percent. If a penalty was imposed on the Tribe in the preceding year, the penalty reduction will be increased by an additional 2 percent, up to a maximum of 21 percent. In determining the penalty amount, we will take into consideration the severity of the failure and whether the reasons for the failure were increases in the unemployment rate in the TFAG service area and changes in TFAG caseload size during the fiscal year in question; and</P>
              <P>(4) If a Tribe fails to repay a Federal loan provided under section 406 of the Act, we will reduce the TFAG for the following fiscal year by an amount equal to the outstanding loan amount plus interest.</P>
              <P>(b) In calculating the amount of the penalty, we will add together all applicable penalty percentages, and the total is applied to the amount of the TFAG that would have been payable if no penalties were assessed against the Tribe. As a final step, we will subtract other (non-percentage) penalty amounts.</P>
              <P>(c) When imposing the penalties in paragraph (a) of this section, we will not reduce an affected Tribe's grant by more than 25 percent. If the 25 percent limit prevents the recovery of the full penalty imposed on a Tribe during a fiscal year, we will apply the remaining amount of the penalty to the TFAG payable for the immediately succeeding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(1) If we reduce the TFAG payable to a Tribe for a fiscal year because of penalties that have been imposed, the Tribe must expend additional Tribal funds to replace any such reduction. The Tribe must document compliance with this provision on its TANF expenditure report.</P>

              <P>(2) We will impose a penalty of not more than 2 percent of the amount of the TFAG on a Tribe that fails to expend additional Tribal funds to replace amounts deducted from the TFAG due to penalties. We will apply this penalty <PRTPAGE P="205"/>to the TFAG payable for the next succeeding fiscal year, and this penalty cannot be excused (see § 286.235).</P>
              <P>(d) If a Tribe retrocedes the program, the Tribe will be liable for any penalties incurred for the period the program was in operation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will we determine if Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds were misused or intentionally misused?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) We will use the single audit or Federal review or audit to determine if a Tribe should be penalized for misusing Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds under § 286.195(a)(1) or intentionally misusing Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds under § 286.195(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(b) If a Tribe uses the TFAG in violation of the provisions of the Act, the provisions of 45 CFR part 75, or any Federal statutes and regulations applicable to the TANF program, we will consider the funds to have been misused.</P>
              <P>(c) The Tribe must show, to our satisfaction, that it used the funds for purposes that a reasonable person would consider to be within the purposes of the TANF program (as specified at § 286.35) and the provisions listed in § 286.45.</P>
              <P>(d) We will consider the TFAG to have been intentionally misused under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) There is supporting documentation, such as Federal guidance or policy instructions, indicating that TANF funds could not be used for that purpose; or</P>
              <P>(2) After notification that we have determined such use to be improper, the Tribe continues to use the funds in the same or similarly improper manner.</P>
              <P>(e) If the single audit determines that a Tribe misused Federal funds in applying the negotiated time limit provisions under § 286.115, the amount of the penalty for misuse will be limited to five percent of the TFAG amount.</P>
              <P>(1) This penalty shall be in addition to the reduction specified under § 286.195(a)(1).</P>

              <P>(2) Formally issued Federal guidance which provided incorrect information resulting in the Tribe's failure or prior to the effective date of these regulations, guidance that was issued after a Tribe implemented the requirements of the Act based on a different, but reasonable, interpretation of the Act.</P>

              <P>(1) Clearly demonstrates that its failure to submit complete, accurate, and timely data, as required at § 286.245, for one or both of the first two quarters of FY 2000, is attributable, in significant part, to its need to divert critical system resources to Year 2000 compliance activities; and</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">TANF Data Report: Aggregated Data—Section three.</E> Each Tribe must file aggregated information on families receiving, applying for, and no longer receiving TANF assistance. This section of the Report asks for aggregate figures in the following areas: the total number of applications and their disposition; the total number of recipient families, adult recipients, and child recipients; the total number of births, out-of-wedlock births, and minor child heads-of-households; the total number of non-custodial parents participating in work activities; and the total amount of TANF assistance provided.</P>

              <P>(a) Each Tribe may report disaggregated data on all recipient families (universal reporting) or on a sample of families selected through the use of a scientifically acceptable sampling method. The sampling method must be approved by ACF in advance of submitting reports.</P>
              <P>(1) Tribes may not use a sample to generate the aggregated data.</P>

              <P>(b) Each Tribe must submit its TANF Data Report and TANF Financial Report within 45 days following the end of each quarter. If the 45th day falls on a weekend or on a national, State or Tribal holiday, the reports are due no later than the next business day.</P>

              <P>(a) If we determine that a Tribe has not submitted to us a complete and accurate Tribal TANF Data Report within the time limit, the Tribe risks the imposition of a penalty at § 286.205 related to the work participation rate targets since the data from the Tribal TANF Data Report is required to calculate participation rates.</P>
              <P>(b) Non-reporting of the Tribal TANF Financial Report may give rise to a penalty under § 286.200 since this Report is used to demonstrate compliance with provisions of the Act, the provisions of 45 CFR part 75, or any Federal statutes and regulations applicable to the TANF program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Approval of State plans and amendments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The State plan consists of records furnished by the State to cover its Child Support Enforcement program under title IV-D of the Act. After approval of the original plan by the Office, all relevant changes, required by new statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions, are required to be submitted currently so that the Office may determine whether the plan continues to meet Federal requirements and policies.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Submittal.</E> State plans and revisions of the plans are submitted first to the State governor or his designee for review in accordance with § 301.12, and then to the regional office. The States are encouraged to obtain consultation of the regional staff when a plan is in process of preparation or revision.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Review.</E> The Office of Child Support Enforcement in the regional offices is responsible for review of State plans and amendments. It also initiates discussion with the IV-D agency on clarification of significant aspects of the plan which come to its attention in the course of this review. State plan material on which the regional staff has questions concerning the application of Federal policy is referred with recommendations as required to the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the central office for technical assistance. Comments and suggestions, including those of consultants in specified areas, may be prepared by the central office for use by the regional staff in negotiations with the IV-D agency.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Action.</E> The Regional Office exercises delegated authority to take affirmative action on the State plan and amendments thereto on the basis of policy statements or precedents previously approved by the Director. The Director retains authority for determining that proposed plan material is not approvable, or that a previously approved plan no longer meets the requirements for approval, except that a final determination of disapproval may not be made without prior consultation and discussion by the Director with the Secretary. The Regional Office or the Director formally notifies the IV-D agency of the actions taken on the State plan or revisions thereto.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Basis for approval.</E> Determinations as to whether the State plan (including plan amendments and administrative practice under the plan) originally meets or continues to meet the requirements for approval are based on relevant Federal statutes and regulations. Guidelines are furnished to assist in the interpretation of the regulations.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Prompt approval of the State plan.</E> The determination as to whether the State plan submitted for approval conforms to the requirements for approval under the Act and regulations issued pursuant thereto shall be made promptly and not later than the 90th day following the date on which the <PRTPAGE P="227"/>plan submittal is received in OCSE Regional Program Office, unless the Regional Office has secured from the IV-D agency an agreement, which is reflected in a record, to extend that period.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Prompt approval of plan amendments.</E> Any amendment of an approved State plan may, at the option of the State, be considered as a submission of a new State plan. If the State requests that such amendments be so considered, the determination as to its conformity with the requirements for approval shall be made promptly and not later than the 90th day following the date on which such a request is received in the Regional Office with respect to an amendment that has been received in such office, unless the Regional Office has secured from the State agency an agreement, which is reflected in a record, to extend that period.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The effective date of a new plan may not be earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter in which an approvable plan is submitted.</P>

Within 30 days after receipt of such a petition, the Director shall notify the State of the time and place at which the hearing for the purpose of reconsidering such issue will be held. Such hearing shall be held not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date notice of such hearing is furnished to the State, unless the Director and the State agree in writing on another time. The hearing procedures contained in 45 CFR part 213 applicable to § 201.4 of this title shall apply to reconsiderations brought under this section. A determination affirming, modifying, or reversing the Director's original decision will be made within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing. Action pursuant to an initial determination by the Director described in such § 301.1 (e) or (f) that a plan or amendment is not approvable shall not be stayed pending the reconsideration, but in the event that the Director subsequently determines that his original decision was incorrect he shall certify restitution forthwith in a lump sum of any funds incorrectly withheld or otherwise denied.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies to every person who, as a regular part of his or her employment, receives, disburses, handles or has access to support collections, which includes:</P>
            <P>(1) IV-D agency employees and employees of any other State or local agency to which IV-D functions have been delegated.</P>

            <P>The State plan shall provide that the following requirements and criteria to separate the cash handling and accounting functions are in effect.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">IV-D responsibility.</E> The IV-D agency will maintain methods of administration designed to assure that persons responsible for handling cash receipts of support do not participate in accounting or operating functions which would permit them to conceal in the accounting records the misuse of support receipts. Such methods of administration shall follow generally recognized accounting standards.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies to persons who participate in the collection, accounting or operating functions which include:</P>

            <P>(2) In the case of any individual with respect to whom an assignment as defined in § 301.1 of this chapter is effective, to secure support for a child or children from any person who is legally liable for such support, using State laws regarding intrastate and interstate establishment and enforcement of support obligations. Effective October 1, 1985, this includes securing support for a spouse or former spouse who is living with the child or children, but only if a support obligation has been established for that spouse and the child support obligation is being enforced under the title IV-D State plan.</P>

            <P>(c) The IV-D agency will not undertake to establish paternity or secure support in any case for which it has received notice that there has been a finding of good cause unless there has been a determination that support enforcement may proceed without the participation of the caretaker or other relative. If there has been such a determination, the IV-D agency will undertake to establish paternity or secure support but may not involve the caretaker or other relative in such undertaking.</P>

            <P>(b) Timeframes for disbursement of support payments by SDUs under section 454B of the Act.<PRTPAGE P="233"/>

            <P>(2) Amounts collected by the IV-D agency on behalf of recipients of aid under the State's title IV-A or IV-E plan for whom an assignment under sections 408(a)(3) or 471(a)(17) of the Act is effective shall be disbursed by the SDU within the following timeframes:</P>
            <P>(i) Except as specified under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, if the SDU sends payment to the family (other than payments sent to the family from the State share of assigned support collections), the SDU must send these payments within 2 business days of the end of the month in which the payment was received by the SDU. Any payment passed through to the family from the State share of assigned support collections must be sent to the family within 2 business days of the date of receipt by the SDU.</P>
            <P>(ii) Except as specified under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, when the SDU sends collections to the family for the month after the month the family becomes ineligible for title IV-A, the SDU must send collections to the family within 2 business days of the date of receipt by the SDU.</P>
            <P>(iii) Except as specified under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, when the SDU sends collections to the IV-E foster care agency under § 302.52(b)(2) and (4) of this part, the SDU must send collections to the IV-E agency within 15 business days of the end of the month in which the support was received by the SUD.</P>
            <P>(iv) Collections as a result of Federal tax refund offset paid to the family or distributed in title IV-E foster care cases under § 302.52(b)(4) of this part, must be sent to the title IV-A family or title IV-E agency, as appropriate, within 30 calendar days of the date of initial receipt by the title IV-D agency, unless State law requires a post-offset appeal process and an appeal is filed timely, in which case the SDU must send any payment to the title IV-A family or title IV-E agency within 15 calendar days of the date the appeal is resolved.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, amounts collected on behalf of individuals receiving services under § 302.33 of this part shall be disbursed by the SDU pursuant to section 457 of the Act, within 2 business days of receipt by the SDU.</P>
            <P>(ii) Collections due the family as a result of Federal tax refund offset must be sent to the family within 30 calendar days of the date of initial receipt in the title IV-D agency, except:</P>

            <P>(i) Files an application for the services with the IV-D agency. In an interstate case, only the initiating State may require an application under this section; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Is a non-IV-A Medicaid recipient; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Has been receiving IV-D services and is no longer eligible for assistance under the title IV-A, IV-E foster care, and Medicaid program.</P>
            <P>(2) The State may not require an application, other request for services or an application fee from any individual who is eligible to receive services under paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section. If an individual receiving services under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section refuses services in response to a notice under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and subsequently requests services, that individual must file an application and pay an application fee.</P>

            <P>(3) The State may not charge fees or recover costs from any individual who is eligible to receive services under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="234"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) Whenever a family is no longer eligible for assistance under the State's title IV-A and Medicaid programs, the IV-D agency must notify the family, within 5 working days of the notification of ineligibility, that IV-D services will be continued unless the family notifies the IV-D agency that it no longer wants services but instead wants to close the case. This notice must inform the family of the benefits and consequences of continuing to receive IV-D services, including the available services and the State's fees, cost recovery, and distribution policies. This requirement to notify the family that services will be continued, unless the family notifies the IV-D agency to the contrary, also applies when a child is no longer eligible for IV-E foster care, but only in those cases that the IV-D agency determines that such services and notice would be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(5) The State must provide all appropriate IV-D services, in addition to IV-D services related to securing medical support, to all individuals who are eligible to receive services under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section unless the individual notifies the State that only IV-D services related to securing medical support are wanted.</P>
            <P>(6) The State may elect in its State plan to allow an individual under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section who files an application to request paternity-only limited services in an intrastate case. If the State chooses this option, the State must define how this process will be implemented and must establish and use procedures, including domestic violence safeguards, which are reflected in a record, that specify when paternity-only limited services will be available. An application will be considered full-service unless the parent specifically applies for paternity-only limited services in accordance with the State's procedures. If one parent specifically requests paternity-only limited services and the other parent requests full services, the case will automatically receive full services. The State will be required to charge the application and service fees required under paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section for paternity-only limited services, and may recover costs in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section if the State has chosen this option in its State plan. The State must provide the applicant an application form with information on the availability of paternity-only limited services, consequences of selecting this limited service, and an explanation that the case will be closed when the limited service is completed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Applicant's income</E> means the disposable income available for the applicant's use under State law.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Application fee.</E> (1) Beginning October 1, 1985, the State plan must provide that an application fee will be charged for each individual who applies for services under this section. Under this paragraph:</P>
            <P>(i) The State shall collect the application fee from the individual applying for IV-D services or pay the application fee out of State funds.</P>
            <P>(ii) The State may recover the application fee from the noncustodial parent who owes a support obligation to a non-IV-A family on whose behalf the IV-D agency is providing services and repay it to the applicant or itself.</P>
            <P>(iii) State funds used to pay an application fee are not program expenditures under the State plan but are program income under § 304.50 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(iv) Any application fee charged must be uniformly applied on a statewide basis and must be:</P>
            <P>(A) A flat dollar amount not to exceed $25 (or such higher or lower amount as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate for any fiscal year to reflect increases or decreases in administrative costs); or</P>
            <P>(B) An amount based on a fee schedule not to exceed the flat dollar amount specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section. The fee schedule must be based on the applicant's income.</P>
            <P>(v) The State may allow the jurisdiction that collects support for the State under this part to retain any application fee collected under this section.</P>

            <P>(2) In an interstate case, the application fee is charged by the State where the individual applies for services under this section.<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Recovery of costs.</E> (1) The State may elect in its State plan to recover any costs incurred in excess of any fees collected to cover administrative costs under the IV-D State plan. A State which elects to recover costs shall collect on a case by case basis either excess actual or standardized costs:</P>
            <P>(i) From the individual who owes a support obligation to a non-IV-A family on whose behalf the IV-D agency is providing services under this section; or</P>
            <P>(ii) From the individual who is receiving IV-D services under paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this section, either directly or from the support collected on behalf of the individual, but only if the State has in effect a procedure for informing all individuals authorized within the State to establish an obligation for support that the State will recover costs from the individual receiving IV-D services under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) A State that recovers standardized costs under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall develop a methodology, which is reflected in a record, to determine standardized costs which are as close to actual costs as is possible. This methodology must be made available to any individual upon request.</P>
            <P>(3) The IV-D agency shall not treat any amount collected from the individual as a recovery of costs under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section except amounts which exceed the current support owed by the individual under the obligation.</P>
            <P>(4) If a State elects to recover costs under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the IV-D agency may attempt to seek reimbursement from the individual who owes a support obligation for any costs paid by the individual who is receiving IV-D services and pay all amounts reimbursed to the individual who is receiving IV-D services.</P>
            <P>(5) If a State elects to recover costs under this section, the IV-D agency must notify, consistent with the option selected, either the individual who is receiving IV-D services under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this section, or the individual who owes a support obligation that such recovery will be made. In an interstate case, the IV-D agency where the case originated must notify the individual receiving IV-D services of the States that recover costs.</P>
            <P>(6) The IV-D agency must notify the IV-D agencies in all other States if it recovers costs from the individual receiving IV-D services.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Annual $25 fee.</E> (1) A State must impose in, and report for, a Federal fiscal year an annual fee of $25 for each case if there is an individual in the case to whom IV-D services are provided and:</P>
            <P>(i) For whom the State has collected and disbursed to the family at least $500 of support in that year; and</P>
            <P>(ii) No individual in the case has received assistance under a former State AFDC program, assistance as defined in § 260.31 under a State TANF program, or assistance as defined in § 286.10 under a Tribal TANF program.</P>
            <P>(2) The State must impose the annual $25 fee in international cases under section 454(32) of the Act in which the criteria for imposition of the annual $25 fee under paragraph (1) of this section are met.</P>
            <P>(3) For each Federal fiscal year, after the first $500 of support is collected and disbursed to the family, the fee must be collected by one or more of the following methods:</P>
            <P>(i) Retained by the State from support collected in cases subject to the fee in accordance with distribution requirements in § 302.51(a)(5) of this part, except that no cost will be assessed for such services against:</P>
            <P>(A) A foreign obligee in an international case receiving IV-D services pursuant to section 454(32)(C) of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(B) An individual who is required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7;</P>
            <P>(ii) Paid by the individual applying for services under section 454(4)(A)(ii) of the Act and implementing regulations in this section, provided that the individual is not required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7;</P>

            <P>(iii) Recovered from the noncustodial parent, provided that the noncustodial parent is not an individual required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a <PRTPAGE P="236"/>condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Paid by the State out of its own funds.</P>
            <P>(4) The State must report, in accordance with § 302.15 of this part and instructions issued by the Secretary, the total amount of annual $25 fees imposed under this section for each Federal fiscal year as program income, regardless of which method or methods are used under paragraph (3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) State funds used to pay the annual $25 fee shall not be considered administrative costs of the State for the operation of the title IV-D plan, and all annual $25 fees imposed during a Federal fiscal year must be considered income to the program, in accordance with § 304.50 of this chapter.</P>

Such arrangements shall contain provisions for providing courts and law enforcement officials with pertinent information needed in locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity and securing support, to the extent that such information is relevant to the duties to be performed pursuant to the arrangement. They shall also provide for assistance to the IV-D agency in carrying out the program, and may relate to any other matters of common concern. Under matters of common concern, such arrangements may include provisions for the investigation and prosecution of fraud directly related to paternity and child and spousal support, and provisions to reimburse courts and law enforcement officials for their assistance.</P>

            <P>The State plan shall provide as follows:</P>
            <P>(a)(1) For purposes of distribution in a IV-D case, amounts collected, except as provided under paragraphs (a)(3) and (5) of this section, shall be treated first as payment on the required support obligation for the month in which the support was collected and if any amounts are collected which are in excess of such amount, these excess amounts shall be treated as amounts which represent payment on the required support obligation for previous months.</P>
            <P>(2) In title IV-A and title IV-E foster care cases in which conversion to a monthly amount is necessary because support is ordered to be paid other than monthly, the IV-D agency may round off the converted amount to whole dollar amount for the purpose of distribution under this section and § 302.52 of this part.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii), amounts collected through Federal tax refund offset must be distributed as arrearages in accordance with § 303.72 of this chapter, and section 457 of the Act;</P>
            <P>(ii) Effective October 1, 2009, or up to a year earlier at State option, amounts collected through Federal tax refund offset shall be distributed in accordance with § 303.72 of this chapter and the option selected under section 454(34) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) Effective October 1, 1998 (or October 1, 1999 if applicable) except with respect to those collections addressed under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and except as specified under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, with respect to amounts collected and distributed under title IV-D of the Act, the date of collection for distribution purposes in all IV-D cases is the date of receipt in the State disbursement unit established under section 454B of the Act.</P>
            <P>(ii) If current support is withheld by an employer in the month when due, and received by the State in a month other than the month when due, the date of withholding may be deemed to be the date of collection.</P>
            <P>(iii) When the date of collection pursuant to this subparagraph is deemed to be the date the wage or other income was withheld, and the employer fails to report the date of withholding, the IV-D agency must reconstruct that date by contacting the employer or comparing actual amounts collected with the pay schedule specified in the court or administrative order.</P>
            <P>(5)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(ii), a State must pay to a family that has never received assistance under a program funded or approved under title IV-A or foster care under title IV-E of the Act and to an individual who is not required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7 the portion of the amount collected that remains after withholding any annual $25 fee that the State imposes under § 302.33(e) of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) If a State charges the noncustodial parent the annual $25 fee under § 302.33(e) of this part, the State may retain the $25 fee from the support collected after current support and any payment on arrearages for the month under a court or administrative order have been disbursed to the family provided the noncustodial parent is not required to cooperate with the IV-D program as a condition of Food Stamp eligibility as defined at § 273.11(o) and (p) of title 7.</P>

            <P>(b) If an amount collected as support represents payment on the required support obligation for future months, the amount shall be applied to such future months. However, no such amounts shall be applied to future months unless amounts have been collected which fully satisfy the support obligation assigned under section <PRTPAGE P="240"/>403(a)(8) of the Act for the current month and all past months.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) The amounts collected by the IV-D agency which represent specific dollar amounts designated in the support order for medical purposes that have been assigned to the State under 42 CFR 433.146 shall be forwarded to the Medicaid agency for distribution under 42 CFR 433.154.</P>
            <P>(2) When a family ceases receiving assistance under the State's title XIX plan, the assignment of medical support rights under section 1912 of the Act terminates, except for the amount of any unpaid medical support obligation that has accrued under such assignment.

            <P>Effective October 1, 1984, the State plan shall provide as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) For purposes of distribution under this section, amounts collected in foster care maintenance cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of § 302.51(a) of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) The amounts collected as support by the IV-D agency under the State plan on behalf of children for whom the State is making foster care maintenance payments under the title IV-E State plan and for whom an assignment under section 471(a)(17) of the Act is effective shall be distributed as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Any amount that is collected in a month which represents payment on the required support obligation for that month shall be retained by the State to reimburse itself for foster care maintenance payments. Of that amount retained by the State as reimbursement for that month's foster care maintenance payment, the State IV-D agency shall determine the Federal government's share so that the State may reimburse the Federal government to the extent of its participation in financing of the foster care maintenance payment.</P>
            <P>(2) If the amount collected is in excess of the monthly amount of the foster care maintenance payment but not more than the monthly support obligation, the State must pay the excess to the State agency responsible for supervising the child's placement and care under section 472(a)(2) of the Act. The State agency must use the money in the manner it determines will serve the best interests of the child including:</P>
            <P>(i) Setting aside amounts for the child's future needs; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Making all or part of the amount available to the person responsible for meeting the child's daily needs to be used for the child's benefit.</P>
            <P>(3) If the amount collected exceeds the amount required to be distributed under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, but not the total unreimbursed foster care maintenance payments provided under title IV-E or unreimbursed assistance payments provided under title IV-A, the State shall retain the excess to reimburse itself for these payments. If past assistance or foster care maintenance payments are greater than the total support obligation owed, the maximum amount the State may retain as reimbursement for such payments is the amount of such obligation. If amounts are collected which represent the required support obligation for periods prior to the first month in which the family received assistance under the State's title IV-A plan or foster care maintenance payments under the State's title IV-E plan, such amounts may be retained by the State to reimburse the difference between such support obligation and such payments. Of the amounts retained by the State, the State IV-D agency shall determine the Federal government's share of the amount so that the State may reimburse the Federal government to the extent of its participation in financing the assistance payments and foster care maintenance payments.</P>

            <P>(4) Any balance shall be paid to the State agency responsible for supervising the child's placement and care <PRTPAGE P="241"/>and shall be used to serve the best interests of the child as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) If an amount collected as support represents payment on the required support obligation for future months, the amount shall be applied to those future months. However, no amounts shall be applied to future months unless amounts have been collected which fully satisfy the support obligation assigned under sections 408(a)(3) and 471 (a)(17) of the Act for the current month and all past months.</P>
            <P>(c) When a State ceases making foster care maintenance payments under the State's title IV-E State plan, the assignment of support rights under section 471(a)(17) of the Act terminates except for the amount of any unpaid support that has accrued under the assignment. The IV-D agency shall attempt to collect such unpaid support. Under this requirement, any collection made by the State under this paragraph must be distributed in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Guidelines for setting child support orders.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Within 1 year after completion of the State's next quadrennial review of its child support guidelines, that commences more than 1 year after publication of the final rule, in accordance with § 302.56(e), as a condition of approval of its State plan, the State must <PRTPAGE P="242"/>establish one set of child support guidelines by law or by judicial or administrative action for setting and modifying child support order amounts within the State that meet the requirements in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) The State must have procedures for making the guidelines available to all persons in the State.</P>
            <P>(c) The child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section must at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(1) Provide that the child support order is based on the noncustodial parent's earnings, income, and other evidence of ability to pay that:</P>
            <P>(i) Takes into consideration all earnings and income of the noncustodial parent (and at the State's discretion, the custodial parent);</P>
            <P>(ii) Takes into consideration the basic subsistence needs of the noncustodial parent (and at the State's discretion, the custodial parent and children) who has a limited ability to pay by incorporating a low-income adjustment, such as a self-support reserve or some other method determined by the State; and</P>
            <P>(iii) If imputation of income is authorized, takes into consideration the specific circumstances of the noncustodial parent (and at the State's discretion, the custodial parent) to the extent known, including such factors as the noncustodial parent's assets, residence, employment and earnings history, job skills, educational attainment, literacy, age, health, criminal record and other employment barriers, and record of seeking work, as well as the local job market, the availability of employers willing to hire the noncustodial parent, prevailing earnings level in the local community, and other relevant background factors in the case.</P>
            <P>(2) Address how the parents will provide for the child's health care needs through private or public health care coverage and/or through cash medical support;</P>
            <P>(3) Provide that incarceration may not be treated as voluntary unemployment in establishing or modifying support orders; and</P>
            <P>(4) Be based on specific descriptive and numeric criteria and result in a computation of the child support obligation.</P>
            <P>(d) The State must include a copy of the child support guidelines in its State plan.</P>
            <P>(e) The State must review, and revise, if appropriate, the child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section at least once every four years to ensure that their application results in the determination of appropriate child support order amounts. The State shall publish on the internet and make accessible to the public all reports of the guidelines reviewing body, the membership of the reviewing body, the effective date of the guidelines, and the date of the next quadrennial review.</P>
            <P>(f) The State must provide that there will be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the establishment and modification of a child support order, that the amount of the order which would result from the application of the child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section is the correct amount of child support to be ordered.</P>
            <P>(g) A written finding or specific finding on the record of a judicial or administrative proceeding for the establishment or modification of a child support order that the application of the child support guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case will be sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case, as determined under criteria established by the State. Such criteria must take into consideration the best interests of the child. Findings that rebut the child support guidelines shall state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines and include a justification of why the order varies from the guidelines.</P>
            <P>(h) As part of the review of a State's child support guidelines required under paragraph (e) of this section, a State must:</P>

            <P>(1) Consider economic data on the cost of raising children, labor market data (such as unemployment rates, employment rates, hours worked, and earnings) by occupation and skill-level for the State and local job markets, <PRTPAGE P="243"/>the impact of guidelines policies and amounts on custodial and noncustodial parents who have family incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, and factors that influence employment rates among noncustodial parents and compliance with child support orders;</P>
            <P>(2) Analyze case data, gathered through sampling or other methods, on the application of and deviations from the child support guidelines, as well as the rates of default and imputed child support orders and orders determined using the low-income adjustment required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The analysis must also include a comparison of payments on child support orders by case characteristics, including whether the order was entered by default, based on imputed income, or determined using the low-income adjustment required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii). The analysis of the data must be used in the State's review of the child support guidelines to ensure that deviations from the guidelines are limited and guideline amounts are appropriate based on criteria established by the State under paragraph (g); and</P>
            <P>(3) Provide a meaningful opportunity for public input, including input from low-income custodial and noncustodial parents and their representatives. The State must also obtain the views and advice of the State child support agency funded under title IV-D of the Act.</P>

            <P>(3) Establish and use criteria, which are reflected in a record, for selecting cases to pursue via the withholding of unemployment compensation for support purposes. These criteria must be designed to ensure maximum case selection and minimal discretion in the selection process.</P>
            <P>(4) Provide a receipt at least annually to an individual who requests a receipt for the support paid via the withholding of unemployment compensation, if receipts are not provided through other means.</P>

            <P>(iv) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity creates a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity, and under which such voluntary acknowledgment is admissible as evidence of paternity;</P>
            <P>(v) Procedures which provide that any objection to genetic testing results must be made in writing within a specified number of days before any hearing at which such results may be introduced into evidence; and if no objection is made, a report of the test results, which is reflected in a record, is admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy;</P>

            <P>(2) When an individual requests an application for IV-D services, provide an application to the individual on the day the individual makes a request in person, or send an application to the individual within no more than 5 working days of a request received by telephone or in a record. Information describing available services, the individual's rights and responsibilities, and the State's fees, cost recovery and distribution policies must accompany all applications for services and must be provided to title IV-A, Medicaid and title IV-E foster care applicants or recipients within no more than 5 working days of referral to the IV-D agency; and</P>

            <P>(b) For all cases referred to the IV-D program for IV-D services because of an assignment of support rights or cases opened upon application for IV-D services under § 302.33 of this chapter, the IV-D program must attempt to locate all noncustodial parents or their sources of income and/or assets when location is needed to take a necessary action. Under this standard, the IV-D program must:</P>
            <P>(1) Use appropriate location sources such as the Federal PLS; interstate location networks; local officials and employees administering public assistance, general assistance, medical assistance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and social services (whether such individuals are employed by the State or a political subdivision); relatives and friends of the noncustodial parent; current or past employers; electronic communications and internet service providers; utility companies; the U.S. Postal Service; financial institutions; unions; corrections institutions; fraternal organizations; police, parole, and probation records if appropriate; and State agencies and departments, as authorized by State law, including those departments which maintain records of public assistance, wages and employment, unemployment insurance, income taxation, driver's licenses, vehicle registration, and criminal records and other sources;</P>
            <P>(2) Establish working relationships with all appropriate agencies in order to use locate resources effectively;</P>
            <P>(3) Within no more than 75 calendar days of determining that location is necessary, access all appropriate location sources and ensure that location information is sufficient to take the next appropriate action in a case;</P>
            <P>(4) Refer appropriate IV-D cases to the IV-D program of any other State, in accordance with the requirements of § 303.7 of this part. The IV-D program of such other State shall follow the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section for such cases, as necessary, except that the responding State is not required to access the Federal PLS;</P>
            <P>(5) Repeat location attempts in cases in which previous attempts to locate noncustodial parents or sources of income and/or assets have failed, but adequate identifying and other information exists to meet requirements for submittal for location, either quarterly or immediately upon receipt of new information which may aid in location, whichever occurs sooner. Quarterly attempts may be limited to automated sources, but must include accessing State workforce files. Repeated attempts because of new information which may aid in location must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(6) Have in effect safeguards, applicable to all confidential information handled by the IV-D program, that are designed to protect the privacy rights of the parties and that comply with the requirements of sections 454(26) and 454A(d) and (f) of the Act and §§ 303.21 and 307.13.</P>
            <P>(c) The State must establish guidelines defining diligent efforts to serve process. These guidelines must include periodically repeating service of process attempts in cases in which previous attempts to serve process have failed, but adequate identifying and other information exists to attempt service of process.</P>

            <P>(b) Use appropriate State statutes, procedures, and legal processes in establishing and modifying support obligations in accordance with § 302.56 of this chapter, which must include, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(1) Taking reasonable steps to develop a sufficient factual basis for the support obligation, through such means as investigations, case conferencing, interviews with both parties, appear and disclose procedures, parent questionnaires, testimony, and electronic data sources;</P>
            <P>(2) Gathering information regarding the earnings and income of the noncustodial parent and, when earnings and income information is unavailable or insufficient in a case gathering available information about the specific circumstances of the noncustodial parent, including such factors as those listed under § 302.56(c)(1)(iii) of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(3) Basing the support obligation or recommended support obligation amount on the earnings and income of the noncustodial parent whenever available. If evidence of earnings and income is unavailable or insufficient to use as the measure of the noncustodial parent's ability to pay, then the support obligation or recommended support obligation amount should be based on available information about the specific circumstances of the noncustodial parent, including such factors as those listed in § 302.56(c)(1)(iii) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(4) Documenting the factual basis for the support obligation or the recommended support obligation in the case record.</P>

            <P>(d) Within 90 calendar days of locating the alleged father or noncustodial parent, regardless of whether paternity has been established, establish an order for support or complete service of process necessary to commence proceedings to establish a support order and, if necessary, paternity (or document unsuccessful attempts to serve process, in accordance with the State's guidelines defining diligent efforts under § 303.3(c)).</P>
            <P>(e) If the court or administrative authority dismisses a petition for a support order without prejudice, the IV-D agency must, at the time of dismissal, examine the reasons for dismissal and determine when it would be appropriate to seek an order in the future, and seek a support order at that time.</P>
            <P>(f) Seek a support order based on a voluntary acknowledgment in accordance with § 302.70(a)(5)(vii).</P>

            <P>(iii) Use automated methods (including automated comparisons with wage or State income tax data) to identify orders eligible for review, conduct the review, identify orders eligible for adjustment, and apply the appropriate adjustment to the orders eligible for adjustment under any threshold that may be established by the State.</P>
            <P>(2) The State may elect in its State plan to initiate review of an order, after learning that a noncustodial parent will be incarcerated for more than 180 calendar days, without the need for a specific request and, upon notice to both parents, review and, if appropriate, adjust the order, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) If the State elects to conduct the review under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the State must have procedures which permit either party to contest the adjustment, within 30 days after the date of the notice of the adjustment, by making a request for review and, if appropriate, adjustment of the order in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 467(a) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(4) If the State conducts a guideline review under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Review</E> means an objective evaluation, conducted through a proceeding before a court, quasi-judicial process, or administrative body or agency, of information necessary for application of the State's guidelines for support to determine:</P>
            <P>(A) The appropriate support award amount; and</P>
            <P>(B) The need to provide for the child's health care needs in the order through health insurance coverage or other means.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adjustment</E> applies only to the child support provisions of the order, and means:</P>
            <P>(A) An upward or downward change in the amount of child support based upon an application of State guidelines for setting and adjusting child support awards; and/or</P>
            <P>(B) Provision for the child's health care needs, through health insurance coverage or other means.</P>
            <P>(5) The State must have procedures which provide that any adjustment under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be made without a requirement for proof or showing of a change in circumstances.</P>
            <P>(6) The State must have procedures under which, in the case of a request for a review, and if appropriate, an adjustment outside the 3-year cycle (or such shorter cycle as the State may determine) under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State shall review and, if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances, adjust the order in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to section 467(a) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(7) The State must provide notice—</P>
            <P>(i) Not less than once every 3 years to both parents subject to an order informing the parents of their right to request the State to review and, if appropriate, adjust the order consistent with this section. The notice must specify the place and manner in which the request should be made. The initial notice may be included in the order.</P>

            <P>(ii) If the State has not elected paragraph (b)(2) of this section, within 15 business days of when the IV-D agency learns that a noncustodial parent will be incarcerated for more than 180 calendar days, to both parents informing them of the right to request the State <PRTPAGE P="258"/>to review and, if appropriate, adjust the order, consistent with this section. The notice must specify, at a minimum, the place and manner in which the request should be made. Neither the notice nor a review is required under this paragraph if the State has a comparable law or rule that modifies a child support obligation upon incarceration by operation of State law.</P>
            <P>(c) Standard for adequate grounds. The State may establish a reasonable quantitative standard based upon either a fixed dollar amount or percentage, or both, as a basis for determining whether an inconsistency between the existent child support award amount and the amount of support determined as a result of a review is adequate grounds for petitioning for adjustment of the order. Such reasonable quantitative standard must not exclude incarceration as a basis for determining whether an inconsistency between the existing child support order amount and the amount of support determined as a result of a review is adequate grounds for petitioning for adjustment of the order.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Health care needs must be an adequate basis.</E> The need to provide for the child's health care needs in the order, through health insurance or other means, must be an adequate basis under State law to initiate an adjustment of an order, regardless of whether an adjustment in the amount of child support is necessary.</P>
            <P>(e) Timeframes for review and adjustment. Within 180 calendar days of receiving a request for a review or locating the non-requesting parent, whichever occurs later, a State must: Conduct a review of the order and adjust the order or determine that the order should not be adjusted, in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(f) Interstate review and adjustment. (1) In interstate cases, the State with legal authority to adjust the order must conduct the review and adjust the order pursuant to this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The applicable laws and procedures for review and adjustment of child support orders, including the State guidelines for setting child support awards, established in accordance with § 302.56 of this chapter, are those of the State in which the review and adjustment, or determination that there be no adjustment, takes place.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Case closure criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The IV-D agency shall establish a system for case closure.</P>
            <P>(b) The IV-D agency may elect to close a case if the case meets at least one of the following criteria and supporting documentation for the case closure decision is maintained in the case record:</P>
            <P>(1) There is no longer a current support order and arrearages are under $500 or unenforceable under State law;</P>
            <P>(2) There is no longer a current support order and all arrearages in the case are assigned to the State;</P>
            <P>(3) There is no longer a current support order, the children have reached the age of majority, the noncustodial parent is entering or has entered long-term care arrangements (such as a residential care facility or home health care), and the noncustodial parent has no income or assets available above the subsistence level that could be levied or attached for support;</P>
            <P>(4) The noncustodial parent or alleged father is deceased and no further action, including a levy against the estate, can be taken;</P>
            <P>(5) The noncustodial parent is living with the minor child (as the primary caregiver or in an intact two parent household), and the IV-D agency has determined that services are not appropriate or are no longer appropriate;</P>
            <P>(6) Paternity cannot be established because:</P>
            <P>(i) The child is at least 18 years old and an action to establish paternity is barred by a statute of limitations that meets the requirements of § 302.70(a)(5) of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(ii) A genetic test or a court or an administrative process has excluded the alleged father and no other alleged father can be identified;</P>

            <P>(iii) In accordance with § 303.5(b), the IV-D agency has determined that it would not be in the best interests of the child to establish paternity in a case involving incest or rape, or in any <PRTPAGE P="259"/>case where legal proceedings for adoption are pending; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The identity of the biological father is unknown and cannot be identified after diligent efforts, including at least one interview by the IV-D agency with the recipient of services;</P>
            <P>(7) The noncustodial parent's location is unknown, and the State has made diligent efforts using multiple sources, in accordance with § 303.3, all of which have been unsuccessful, to locate the noncustodial parent:</P>
            <P>(i) Over a 2-year period when there is sufficient information to initiate an automated locate effort; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Over a 6-month period when there is not sufficient information to initiate an automated locate effort; or</P>
            <P>(iii) After a 1-year period when there is sufficient information to initiate an automated locate effort, but locate interfaces are unable to verify a Social Security Number;</P>
            <P>(8) The IV-D agency has determined that throughout the duration of the child's minority (or after the child has reached the age of majority), the noncustodial parent cannot pay support and shows no evidence of support potential because the parent has been institutionalized in a psychiatric facility, is incarcerated, or has a medically-verified total and permanent disability. The State must also determine that the noncustodial parent has no income or assets available above the subsistence level that could be levied or attached for support;</P>
            <P>(9) The noncustodial parent's sole income is from:</P>

            <P>(i) Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments made in accordance with sections 1601 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> of title XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1381 <E T="03">et seq.;</E> or</P>

            <P>(10) The noncustodial parent is a citizen of, and lives in, a foreign country, does not work for the Federal government or a company with headquarters or offices in the United States, and has no reachable domestic income or assets; and there is no Federal or State treaty or reciprocity with the country;</P>
            <P>(11) The IV-D agency has provided location-only services as requested under § 302.35(c)(3) of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(12) The non-IV-A recipient of services requests closure of a case and there is no assignment to the State of medical support under 42 CFR 433.146 or of arrearages which accrued under a support order;</P>
            <P>(13) The IV-D agency has completed a limited service under § 302.33(a)(6) of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(14) There has been a finding by the IV-D agency, or at the option of the State, by the responsible State agency of good cause or other exceptions to cooperation with the IV-D agency and the State or local assistance program, such as IV-A, IV-E, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Medicaid, has determined that support enforcement may not proceed without risk of harm to the child or caretaker relative;</P>
            <P>(15) In a non-IV-A case receiving services under § 302.33(a)(1)(i) or (iii) of this chapter, or under § 302.33(a)(1)(ii) when cooperation with the IV-D agency is not required of the recipient of services, the IV-D agency is unable to contact the recipient of services despite a good faith effort to contact the recipient through at least two different methods;</P>

            <P>(iii) The State IV-D agency notified the recipient of services that the case has been transferred to the Tribal IV-D agency and closed; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The Tribal IV-D agency has a State-Tribal agreement approved by OCSE to transfer and close cases. The State-Tribal agreement must include a provision for obtaining the consent from the recipient of services to transfer and close the case.</P>

            <P>(1) The child is eligible for health care services from the Indian Health Service (IHS); and</P>
            <P>(2) The IV-D case was opened because of a Medicaid referral based solely upon health care services, including the Purchased/Referred Care program, provided through an Indian Health Program (as defined at 25 U.S.C. 1603(12)).</P>
            <P>(d) The IV-D agency must have the following requirements for case closure notification and case reopening:</P>
            <P>(1) In cases meeting the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (10) and (b)(15) and (16) of this section, the State must notify the recipient of services in writing 60 calendar days prior to closure of the case of the State's intent to close the case.</P>

            <P>(4) For cases to be closed in accordance with paragraph (b)(13) of this section, the State must notify the recipient of services, in writing, 60 calendar days prior to closure of the case of the State's intent to close the case. This notice must also provide information regarding reapplying for child support services and the consequences of receiving services, including any State fees, cost recovery, and distribution policies. If the recipient reapplies for child support services in a case that was closed in accordance with paragraph (b)(13) of this section, the recipient must complete a new application for IV-D services and pay any applicable fee.</P>
            <P>(5) If the case is closed, the former recipient of services may request at a later date that the case be reopened if there is a change in circumstances that could lead to the establishment of paternity or a support order or enforcement of an order by completing a new application for IV-D services and paying any applicable fee.</P>
            <P>(6) For notices under paragraphs (d)(1) and (4) of this section, if the recipient of services specifically authorizes consent for electronic notifications, the IV-D agency may elect to notify the recipient of services electronically of the State's intent to close the case.

            <P>(3) Cash medical support or the cost of health insurance is considered reasonable in cost if the cost to the parent responsible for providing medical support does not exceed five percent of his or her gross income or, at State option, a reasonable alternative income-based numeric standard defined in State law, regulations, or court rule having the force of law or State child support guidelines adopted in accordance with § 302.56(c) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(ii) Allocate the cost of coverage between the parents.</P>
            <P>(2) If health care coverage described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not available at the time the order is entered or modified, petition to include cash medical support in new or modified orders until such time as health care coverage, that is accessible and reasonable in cost as defined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, becomes available. In appropriate cases, as defined by the State, cash medical support may be sought in addition to health care coverage.</P>
            <P>(3) Establish criteria, which are reflected in a record, to identify orders that do not address the health care needs of children based on—</P>
            <P>(i) Evidence that health care coverage may be available to either parent at reasonable cost, as defined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Facts, as defined by State law, regulation, procedure, or other directive, and review and adjustment requirements under § 303.8(d) of this part, which are sufficient to warrant modification of the existing support order to address the health care needs of children in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for collection of past-due support by Federal tax refund offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Past-due support qualifying for offset.</E> Past-due support as defined in § 301.1 of this chapter qualifies for offset if:</P>
            <P>(1) There has been an assignment of the support rights under section 408(a)(3) of the Act or section 471(a)(17) of the Act to the State making the request for offset or the IV-D agency is providing services under § 302.33 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) For support that has been assigned to the State under section 408(a)(3) of the Act or section 471(a)(17) of the Act, the amount of the support is not less than $150. The State may combine assigned support amounts from the same obligor in multiple cases to reach $150. Amounts under this paragraph may not be combined with amounts under paragraph (a)(3) of this section to reach the minimum amounts required under this paragraph or under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

            <P>(3) For support owed in cases where the title IV-D agency is providing title IV-D services under § 302.33 of this chapter:<PRTPAGE P="270"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The support is owed to or on behalf of a child, or a child and the parent with whom the child is living if the same support order includes support for the child and the parent.</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount of support is not less than $500. The State may combine support amounts from the same obligor in multiple cases where the IV-D agency is providing IV-D services under § 302.33 of this chapter to reach $500.

            <P>(iii) At State option, the amount has accrued since the State IV-D agency began to enforce the support order; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The State has checked its records to determine if a title IV-A or foster care maintenance assigned arrearage exists with respect to the non-IV-A individual or family.</P>
            <P>(4) The IV-D agency has in its records:</P>
            <P>(i) A copy of the order and any modifications upon which the amount referred is based which specify the date of issuance and amount of support;</P>
            <P>(ii) A copy of the payment record, or, if there is no payment record, an affidavit signed by the custodial parent attesting to the amount of support owed; and</P>
            <P>(iii) In non-IV-A cases, the custodial parent's current address.</P>
            <P>(5) Before submittal, the State IV-D agency has verified the accuracy of the name and social security number of the noncustodial parent and the accuracy of the past-due support amount. If the State IV-D agency has verified this information previously, it need not reverify it.</P>
            <P>(6) A notification of liability for past-due support has been received by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury as prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification to OCSE of liability for past-due support.</E> (1) A State IV-D agency shall submit a notification (or notifications) of liability for past-due support to the Office according to the timeframes and in the manner specified by the Office in instructions.</P>

            <P>(i) The name of the taxpayer who owes the past-due support;</P>
            <P>(ii) The social security number of that taxpayer;</P>
            <P>(iii) The amount of past-due support owed;</P>
            <P>(iv) The State codes as contained in the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publication of the National Bureau of Standards and also promulgated by the General Services Administration in Worldwide Geographical Location Codes; and</P>

            <P>(3) The notification of liability for past-due support may contain with respect to each delinquency the taxpayer's IV-D identifier.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of requests by the Office.</E> (1) The Deputy Director will review each request to determine whether it meets the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If a request meets all requirements, the Deputy Director will transmit the request to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and will notify the State IV-D agency of the transmittal.</P>
            <P>(3) If a request does not meet all requirements, the Deputy Director will attempt to correct the request in consultation with the State IV-D agency.</P>
            <P>(4) If a request cannot be corrected through consultation, the Deputy Director will return it to the State IV-D agency with an explanation of why the request could not be transmitted to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification of changes in case status.</E> (1) The State referring past-due support for offset must, in interstate situations, notify any other State involved in enforcing the support order when it receives the offset amount from the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.</P>

            <P>(2) The State IV-D agency shall, within timeframes established by the Office in instructions, notify the Deputy Director of any deletion of, or any change in, the arrears balance, if the change is significant according to the guidelines developed by the State. The <PRTPAGE P="271"/>notification shall contain the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notices of offset</E>—(1) <E T="03">Advance.</E> The State IV-D agency, or the Office, if the State requests and the Office agrees, shall send a written advance notice to inform a noncustodial parent that the amount of his or her past-due support will be referred to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury for collection by Federal tax refund offset. The notice must inform noncustodial parents:</P>
            <P>(i) Of their right to contest the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of past-due support;</P>
            <P>(ii) Of their right to an administrative review by the submitting State or at the noncustodial parent's request the State with the order upon which the referral for offset is based;</P>
            <P>(iii) Of the procedures and timeframe for contacting the IV-D agency in the submitting State to request administrative review; and</P>
            <P>(iv) That, in the case of a joint return, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will notify the noncustodial parent's spouse at the time of offset regarding the steps to take to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to that spouse. If the IV-D agency sends the notice, it must meet the conditions specified by the Office in instructions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">At offset.</E> The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will notify the noncustodial parent that the offset has been made. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will also notify any individual who filed a joint return with the noncustodial parent of the steps to take in order to secure a proper share of the refund.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedures for contesting in intrastate cases.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a complaint from a noncustodial parent in response to the advance notice required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or concerning a tax refund which has already been offset, the IV-D agency must send a notice to the noncustodial parent and, in non-IV-A cases the custodial parent, of the time and place of the administrative review of the complaint and conduct the review to determine the validity of the complaint.</P>
            <P>(2) If the complaint concerns a joint tax refund that has not yet been offset, the IV-D agency must inform the noncustodial parent that the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury will notify the noncustodial parent's spouse at the time of offset regarding the steps to take to secure his or her proper share of the refund. If the complaint concerns a joint tax refund which has already been offset, the IV-D agency must refer the noncustodial parent to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.</P>
            <P>(3) If the administrative review results in a deletion of, or change in, the arrears balance, the IV-D agency must notify OCSE within timeframes established by the Office and include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) If, as a result of the administrative review, an amount which has already been offset is found to have exceeded the amount of past-due support owed, the IV-D agency must take steps to refund the excess amount to the noncustodial parent promptly.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Procedures for contesting in interstate cases.</E> (1) If the noncustodial parent requests an administrative review in the submitting State, the IV-D agency must meet the requirements in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If the complaint cannot be resolved by the submitting State and the noncustodial parent requests an administrative review in the State with the order upon which the referral for offset is based, the submitting State must notify the State with the order of the request for an administrative review and provide that State with all necessary information, including the information listed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, within 10 days of the noncustodial parent's request for an administrative review.</P>
            <P>(3) The State with the order must send a notice to the noncustodial parent and, in non-IV-A cases the custodial parent, of the time and place of the administrative review, conduct the review and make a decision within 45 days of receipt of the notice and information from the submitting State.</P>

            <P>(4) If the administrative review results in a deletion of, or change in, the arrears balance, the State with the order upon which the referral for offset is based must notify the submitting State within timeframes established by <PRTPAGE P="272"/>the Office and include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The submitting State must then notify the Office within timeframes established by the Office and include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) Upon resolution of a complaint after an offset has been made, the State with the order must notify the submitting State of its decision promptly.</P>
            <P>(6) When an administrative review is conducted in the State with the order, the submitting State is bound by the decision made by the State with the order.</P>
            <P>(7) Based on the decision of the State with the order, the IV-D agency in the submitting State must take steps to refund any excess amount to the noncustodial parent promptly.</P>
            <P>(8) In computing the arrearage collection performance level under § 305.2(a)(4) of this chapter, if the case is referred to the State with the order for an administrative review, the collections made as a result of Federal tax refund offset will be treated as having been collected in full by both the submitting State and the State with the order.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Distribution of collections.</E> (1) Collections received by the IV-D agency as a result of Federal tax refund offset to satisfy title IV-A or non-IV-A past-due support shall be distributed as required in accordance with section 457 and, effective October 1, 2009, or up to a year earlier at State option, in accordance with the option selected under section 454(34) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Collections received by the IV-D agency in foster care maintenance cases shall be distributed as past-due support under § 302.52(b) (3) and (4) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(ii), the IV-D agency must inform individuals receiving services under § 302.33 of this chapter in advance that amounts offset will be applied to satisfy any past-due support which has been assigned to the State and submitted for Federal tax refund offset.</P>
            <P>(ii) Effective October 1, 2009, or up to a year earlier at State option, the IV-D agency need no longer meet the requirement for notice under paragraph (h)(3)(i) if the State has opted, under section 454(34) of the Act, to apply amounts submitted to Federal tax refund offset first to satisfy any current support due and past-due support owed to the family.</P>
            <P>(4) If the amount collected is in excess of the amounts required to be distributed under section 457 of the Act, the IV-D agency must repay the excess to the noncustodial parent whose refund was offset or to the parties filing a joint return within a reasonable period in accordance with State law.</P>
            <P>(5) In cases where the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, through OCSE, notifies the State that an offset is being made to satisfy non-IV-A past-due support from a refund based on a joint return, the State may delay distribution until notified that the unobligated spouse's proper share of the refund has been paid or for a period not to exceed six months from notification of offset, whichever is earlier.</P>
            <P>(6) Collections from offset may be applied only to cases that were being enforced by the IV-D agency at the time the advance notice described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section was sent.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Payment of fee.</E> (1) A refund offset fee, in such amount as the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have agreed to be sufficient to reimburse the U.S. Department of Treasury for the full cost of the offset procedure, shall be deducted from the offset amount and credited to the U.S. Department of Treasury appropriations which bore all or part of the costs involved in making the collection. The full amount of the offset must be credited against the obligor's payment record. The fee which the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may impose with respect to non-IV-A submittals shall not exceed $25 per submittal.</P>
            <P>(2) The State IV-D agency may charge an individual who is receiving services under § 302.33(a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this chapter a fee not to exceed $25 for submitting past-due support for Federal tax refund offset. The State must inform the individual in advance of the amount of any fee charged.</P>

            <P>(3) Any State which requests the Office to send the advance written notice under paragraph (e)(1) of this section <PRTPAGE P="273"/>will be charged a fee, in an amount established by the Office in instructions, for printing and mailing of pre-offset notices. This fee shall be credited to the Health and Human Services appropriations which bore all or part of the costs involved in making the collection.</P>
            <P>(j) Each State involved in a referral of past-due support for offset must comply with instructions issued by the Office.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for income withholding.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General withholding requirements.</E> (1) The State must ensure that in the case of each noncustodial parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, and is being enforced under the State plan, so much of his or her income as defined in sections 466(b)(1) and (8) of the Act must be withheld, in accordance with this section, as is necessary to comply with the order.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition to the amount to be withheld to pay the current month's obligation, the amount to be withheld must include an amount to be applied toward liquidation of overdue support.</P>
            <P>(3) The total amount to be withheld under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and, if applicable, (f)(1)(iii) of this section may not exceed the maximum amount permitted under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)).</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of a support order being enforced under the State plan, the withholding must occur without the need for any amendment to the support order involved or any other action by the court or entity that issued it other than that required or permitted under this section.</P>
            <P>(5) If there is more than one notice for withholding against a single noncustodial parent, the State must allocate amounts available for withholding giving priority to current support up to the limits imposed under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)). The State must establish procedures for allocation of support among families, but in no case shall the allocation result in a withholding for one of the support obligations not being implemented.</P>
            <P>(6) The withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State.</P>
            <P>(7) The State must have procedures for promptly terminating withholding:</P>
            <P>(i) In all cases, when there is no longer a current order for support and all arrearages have been satisfied; or,</P>
            <P>(ii) At State option, when the noncustodial parent requests termination and withholding has not been terminated previously and subsequently initiated, and the noncustodial parent meets the conditions for an alternative arrangement set forth under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(8) The State must have procedures for promptly refunding to noncustodial parents amounts which have been improperly withheld.</P>
            <P>(9) Support orders issued or modified in IV-D cases must include a provision requiring the noncustodial parent to keep the IV-D agency informed of the name and address of his or her current employer, whether the noncustodial parent has access to health insurance coverage at reasonable cost and, if so, the health insurance policy information.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Immediate withholding on IV-D cases.</E> (1) In the case of a support order <PRTPAGE P="274"/>being enforced under this part that is issued or modified on or after November 1, 1990, the income of a noncustodial parent shall be subject to withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, on the effective date of the order, except that such income shall not be subject to withholding under this paragraph in any case where:</P>
            <P>(i) Either the noncustodial or custodial parent demonstrates, and the court or administrative authority finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate withholding; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A written agreement is reached between the absent and custodial parent, and, at State option, the State in IV-D cases in which there is an assignment of support rights to the State, which provides for an alternative arrangement.</P>
            <P>(2) For the purposes of this paragraph, any finding that there is good cause not to require immediate withholding must be based on at least:</P>
            <P>(i) A written determination that, and explanation by the court or administrative authority of why, implementing immediate income withholding would not be in the best interests of the child; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Proof of timely payment of previously ordered support in cases involving the modification of support orders.</P>
            <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph, “written agreement” means a written alternative arrangement signed by both the custodial and noncustodial parent, and, at State option, by the State in IV-D cases in which there is an assignment of support rights to the State, and reviewed and entered in the record by the court or administrative authority.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initiated withholding in IV-D cases.</E> In the case of income not subject to immediate withholding under paragraph (b) of this section, including cases subject to a finding of good cause or to a written agreement:</P>
            <P>(1) The income of the noncustodial parent shall become subject to the withholding on the date on which the payments which the noncustodial parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of:</P>
            <P>(i) The date on which the noncustodial parent requests that withholding begin;</P>
            <P>(ii) The date on which the custodial parent requests that withholding begin, if the State determines, in accordance with such procedures and standards as it may establish, that the request should be approved; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Such earlier date as State law or procedure may provide.</P>
            <P>(2) The only basis for contesting a withholding under this paragraph is a mistake of fact, which for purposes of this paragraph means an error in the amount of current or overdue support or in the identity of the alleged noncustodial parent.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to the noncustodial parent in cases of initiated withholding.</E> The State must send a notice to the noncustodial parent regarding the initiated withholding. The notice must inform the noncustodial parent:</P>
            <P>(1) That the withholding has commenced;</P>
            <P>(2) Of the amount of overdue support that is owed, if any, and the amount of wages that will be withheld;</P>

            <P>(i) A State may require registration for orders from other States for purposes of enforcement through withholding only if registration is for the sole purpose of obtaining jurisdiction for enforcement of the order; does not confer jurisdiction on the court or agency for any other purpose (such as modification of the underlying or original support order or resolution of custody or visitation disputes); and does not delay implementation of withholding beyond the timeframes established in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Within 20 calendar days of a determination that withholding is required in a particular case, and, if appropriate, receipt of any information necessary to carry out withholding, the initiating State must notify the IV-D agency of the State in which the noncustodial parent is employed to implement interstate withholding.

            <P>(5) Except with respect to when withholding must be implemented which is controlled by the State where the support order was entered, the law and procedures of the State in which the noncustodial parent is employed shall apply.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Provision for withholding in all child support orders.</E> Child support orders issued or modified in the State whether or not being enforced under the State IV-D plan must have a provision for withholding of income. This requirement does not alter the requirement governing all IV-D cases in paragraph (a)(4) of this section that enforcement under the State plan must <PRTPAGE P="277"/>proceed without the need for a withholding provision in the order.</P>

            <P>(2) Each State will include one-quarter of the estimated total payment in its quarterly collection report which will reduce the amount that would otherwise be paid to the Federal government to reimburse its share of assistance payments under §§ 302.51 and 302.52 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) Following the end of a fiscal year, the Office will calculate the actual incentive payment the State should have received based on the reports submitted for that fiscal year. If adjustments to the estimate made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are necessary, the State's IV-A grant award will be reduced or increased because of over- or under-estimates for prior quarters and for other adjustments.</P>

The remaining amount of the repayment shall be in quarterly amounts not less than those for the 9th through 12th quarters.</FP>
            <P>(7) The amount of a retroactive claim to be paid a State will be offset against any amounts to be, or already being, repaid by the State in installments, under the same title of the Social Security Act. Under this provision the State may choose to:</P>
            <P>(i) Suspend payments until the retroactive claim due the State has, in fact, been offset; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Continue payments until the reduced amount of its debt (remaining after the offset), has been paid in full. This second option would result in a shorter payment period.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The definitions found in § 301.1 of this chapter are also applicable to this part. In addition, for purposes of this part:</P>
            <P>(a) The term <E T="03">IV-D case</E> means a parent (mother, father, or putative father) who is now or eventually may be obligated under law for the support of a child or children receiving services under the title IV-D program. A parent is a separate IV-D case for each family with a dependent child or children that the parent may be obligated to support. If both parents are absent and liable or potentially liable for support of a child or children receiving services under the IV-D program, each parent is considered a separate IV-D case. In counting cases for the purposes of this part, States may exclude cases closed under § 303.11 and cases over which the State has no jurisdiction. Lack of jurisdiction cases are those in which a non-custodial parent resides in the civil jurisdictional boundaries of another country or federally recognized Indian Tribe and no income or assets of this individual are located or derived from outside that jurisdiction and the State has no other means through which to enforce the order.</P>
            <P>(b) The term <E T="03">Current Assistance collections</E> means collections received and distributed on behalf of individuals whose rights to support are required to be assigned to the State under title IV-A of the Act, under title IV-E of the Act, or under title XIX of the Act. In addition, a referral to the State's IV-D agency must have been made.</P>
            <P>(c) The term <E T="03">Former Assistance collections</E> means collections received and distributed on behalf of individuals whose rights to support were formerly required to be assigned to the State under title IV-A (TANF or Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC), title IV-E (Foster Care), or title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(d) The term <E T="03">Never Assistance/Other collections</E> means all other collections received and distributed on behalf of individuals who are receiving child support enforcement services under title IV-D of the Act.</P>
            <P>(e) The term <E T="03">total IV-D dollars expended</E> means total IV-D administrative expenditures claimed by a State in a specified fiscal year adjusted in accordance with § 305.32 of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) The term <E T="03">Consumer Price Index or CPI</E> means the last Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. The CPI for a fiscal year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(g) The term <E T="03">State incentive payment share for a fiscal year</E> means the incentive base amount for the State for the fiscal year divided by the sum of the incentive base amounts for all of the States for the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(h) The term <E T="03">incentive base amount for a fiscal year</E> means the sum of the State's performance level percentages (determined in accordance with § 305.33) multiplied by the State's corresponding maximum incentive base on each of the following measures:</P>
            <P>(1) The paternity establishment performance level;</P>
            <P>(2) The support order performance level;</P>
            <P>(3) The current collections performance level;</P>
            <P>(4) The arrears collections performance level; and</P>
            <P>(5) the cost-effectiveness performance level.</P>
            <P>(i) The term <E T="03">reliable data,</E> means the most recent data available which are <PRTPAGE P="290"/>found by the Secretary to be reliable and is a state that exists when data are sufficiently complete and error free to be convincing for their purpose and context. State data must meet a 95 percent standard of reliability effective beginning in fiscal year 2001. This is with the recognition that data may contain errors as long as they are not of a magnitude that would cause a reasonable person, aware of the errors, to doubt a finding or conclusion based on the data.</P>
            <P>(j) The term <E T="03">complete data</E> means all reporting elements from OCSE reporting forms, necessary to compute a State's performance levels, incentive base amount, and maximum incentive base amount, have been provided within timeframes established in instructions to these forms and § 305.32(f) of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Performance measures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The child support incentive system measures State performance levels in five program areas:</P>
            <P>Paternity establishment; support order establishment; current collections; arrearage collections; and cost-effectiveness. The penalty system measures State performance in three of these areas: Paternity establishment; establishment of support orders; and current collections.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Paternity Establishment Performance Level.</E> States have the choice of being evaluated on one of the following two measures for their paternity establishment percentage (commonly known as the PEP). The count of children shall not include any child who is a dependent by reason of the death of a parent (unless paternity is established for that child). It shall also not include any child whose parent is found to have good cause for refusing to cooperate with the State agency in establishing paternity, or for whom the State agency determines it is against the best interest of the child to pursue paternity issues.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">IV-D Paternity Establishment Percentage</E> means the ratio that the total number of children in the IV-D caseload in the fiscal year (or, at the option of the State, as of the end of the fiscal year) who have been born out-of-wedlock and for whom paternity has been established or acknowledged, bears to the total number of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding fiscal year who were born out-of-wedlock. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):</P>

              <MID>ER27DE00.045</MID>
            </MATH>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Statewide Paternity Establishment Percentage</E> means the ratio that the total number of minor children who have been born out-of-wedlock and for whom paternity has been established or acknowledged during the fiscal year, bears to the total number of children born out-of-wedlock during the preceding fiscal year. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):</P>

            <PRTPAGE P="291"/>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Support Order Establishment Performance Level.</E> This measure requires a determination of whether or not there is a support order for each case. These support orders include all types of legally enforceable orders, such as court, default, and administrative. Since the measure is a case count at a point-in-time, modifications to an order do not affect the count. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):</P>
            <MATH DEEP="26" SPAN="2">
              <MID>ER27DE00.047</MID>
            </MATH>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Current Collections Performance Level.</E> Current support is money applied to current support obligations and does not include payment plans for payment towards arrears. If included, voluntary collections must be included in both the numerator and the denominator. This measure is computed monthly and the total of all months is reported at the end of the year. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):</P>
            <MATH DEEP="26" SPAN="2">
              <MID>ER27DE00.048</MID>
            </MATH>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Arrearage Collection Performance Level.</E> This measure includes those cases where all of the past-due support was disbursed to the family, or retained by the State because all the support was assigned to the State. If some of the past-due support was assigned to the State and some was to be disbursed to the family, only those cases where some of the support actually went to the family can be included. The equation to compute the measure is as follows (expressed as a percent):</P>
            <MATH DEEP="24" SPAN="2">
              <MID>ER27DE00.049</MID>
            </MATH>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Cost-Effectiveness Performance Level.</E> Interstate incoming and outgoing distributed collections will be included for both the initiating and the responding State in this measure. The equation to compute this measure is as follows (expressed as a ratio):</P>
            <MATH DEEP="26" SPAN="2">
              <MID>ER27DE00.050</MID>
            </MATH>

            <P>(b) For incentive purposes, the measures will be weighted in the following manner. Each State will earn five scores based on performance on each of the five measures. Each of the first three measures (paternity establishment, order establishment, and current collections) earn 100 percent of the collections base as defined in § 305.31(e) of this part. The last two measures (collections on arrears and cost-effectiveness) earn a maximum of 75 percent of <PRTPAGE P="292"/>the collections base as defined in § 305.31(e) of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Amount of incentive payment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The incentive payment for a State for a fiscal year is equal to the incentive payment pool for the fiscal year, multiplied by the State incentive payment share for the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(b) The incentive payment pool is:</P>
            <P>(1) $422,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;</P>
            <P>(2) $429,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;</P>
            <P>(3) $450,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;</P>
            <P>(4) $461,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;</P>
            <P>(5) $454,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;</P>
            <P>(6) $446,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;</P>
            <P>(7) $458,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;</P>
            <P>(8) $471,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;</P>
            <P>(9) $483,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and</P>
            <P>(10) For any succeeding fiscal year, the amount of the incentive payment pool for the fiscal year that precedes such succeeding fiscal year multiplied by the percentage (if any) by which the CPI for such preceding fiscal year exceeds the CPI for the second preceding fiscal year. In other words, for each fiscal year following fiscal year 2008, the incentive payment pool will be multiplied by the percentage increase in the CPI between the two preceding years. For example, if the CPI increases by 1 percent between fiscal years 2007 and 2008, then the incentive pool for fiscal year 2009 would be a 1 percent increase over the $483,000,000 incentive payment pool for fiscal year 2008, or $487,830,000.</P>
            <P>(c) The State incentive payment share for a fiscal year is the incentive base amount for the State for the fiscal year divided by the sum of the incentive base amounts for all of the States for the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(d) A State's maximum incentive base amount for a fiscal year is the State's collections base for the fiscal year for the paternity establishment, support order, and current collections performance measures and 75 percent of the State's collections base for the fiscal year for the arrearage collections and cost-effectiveness performance measures.</P>
            <P>(e) A State's maximum incentive base amount for a State for a fiscal year is zero, unless a Federal audit performed under § 305.60 of this part determines that the data submitted by the State for the fiscal year and used to determine the performance level involved are complete and reliable.</P>
            <P>(f) A State's collections base for a fiscal year is equal to: two times the sum of the total amount of support collected for Current Assistance cases plus two times the total amount of support collected in Former Assistance cases, plus the total amount of support collected in Never Assistance/other cases during the fiscal year, that is: 2(Current Assistance collections + Former Assistance collections) + all other collections.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements applicable to calculations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In calculating the amount of incentive payments or penalties, the following conditions apply:</P>
            <P>(a) Each measure is based on data submitted for the Federal fiscal year. The Federal fiscal year runs from October 1st of one year through September 30th of the following year.</P>
            <P>(b) Only those Current Assistance, Former Assistance and Never Assistance/other collections disbursed and those expenditures claimed by the State in the fiscal year will be used to determine the incentive payment payable for that fiscal year;</P>
            <P>(c) Support collected by one State at the request of another State will be treated as having been collected in full by each State;</P>
            <P>(d) Amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project under section 455(e) of the Act will be excluded from the State's total IV-D dollars expended in computing incentive payments;</P>
            <P>(e) Fees paid by individuals, recovered costs, and program income such as interest earned on collections will be deducted from total IV-D dollars expended; and</P>

            <P>(f) States must submit data used to determine incentives and penalties following instructions and formats as required by HHS on Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved reporting instruments. Data necessary to calculate performance for incentives and penalties for a fiscal year must be submitted to the Office of Child Support Enforcement by December 31st, the end of the first quarter after the <PRTPAGE P="293"/>end of the fiscal year. Only data submitted as of December 31st will be used to determine the State's performance for the prior fiscal year and the amount of incentive payments due the States.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination of applicable percentages based on performance levels.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A State's paternity establishment performance level for a fiscal year is, at the option of the State, the IV-D paternity establishment percentage or the Statewide paternity establishment percentage determined under § 305.2 of this part. The applicable percentage for each level of a State's paternity establishment performance can be found in table 1 of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) If the State's paternity establishment performance level for a fiscal year is less than 50 percent, but exceeds its paternity establishment performance level for the immediately preceding fiscal year by at least 10 percentage points, then the State's applicable percentage for the paternity establishment performance level is 50 percent.</P>
            <P>(c) A State's support order establishment performance level for a fiscal year is the percentage of the total number of cases where there is a support order determined under §§ 305.2 and 305.32 of this part. The applicable percentage for each level of a State's support order establishment performance can be found on table 1 of this part, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) If the State's support order establishment performance level for a fiscal year is less than 50 percent, but exceeds the State's support order establishment performance level for the immediately preceding fiscal year by at least 5 percentage points, then the State's applicable percentage is 50 percent.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Payment of incentives.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each State must report one-fourth of its estimated annual incentive payment on each of its four quarterly collections' reports for a fiscal year. When combined with the amounts claimed on each of the State's four quarterly expenditure reports, the portion of the annual estimated incentive payment as reported each quarter will be included in the calculation of the next quarterly grant awarded to the State under title IV-D of the Act.</P>

            <P>(b) Following the end of each fiscal year, HHS will calculate the State's annual incentive payment, using the actual collection and expenditure data and the performance data submitted by December 31st by the State and other States for that fiscal year. A positive <PRTPAGE P="295"/>or negative grant will then be awarded to the State under title IV-D of the Act to reconcile an actual annual incentive payment that has been calculated to be greater or lesser, respectively, than the annual incentive payment estimated prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(c) Payment of incentives is contingent on a State's data being determined complete and reliable by Federal auditors.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reinvestment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A State must expend the full amount of incentive payments received under this part to supplement, and not supplant, other funds used by the State to carry out IV-D program activities or funds for other activities approved by the Secretary which may contribute to improving the effectiveness or efficiency of the State's IV-D program, including cost-effective contracts with local agencies, whether or not the expenditures for the activity are eligible for reimbursement under this part.</P>
            <P>(b) In those States in which incentive payments are passed through to political subdivisions or localities, such payments must be used in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(c) State IV-D expenditures may not be reduced as a result of the receipt and reinvestment of incentive payments.</P>
            <P>(d) A base amount will be determined by subtracting the amount of incentive funds received and reinvested in the State IV-D program for fiscal year 1998 from the total amount expended by the State in the IV-D program during the same period. Alternatively, States have an option of using the average amount of the previous three fiscal years (1996, 1997, and 1998) as a base amount. This base amount of State spending must be maintained in future years. Incentive payments under this part must be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, the base amount. Non-compliance will result in disallowances of incentive amounts equal to the amount of funds supplanted.</P>
            <P>(e) Using the Form OCSE-396, “Child Support Enforcement Program Quarterly Financial Report,” the State Current Spending Level will be calculated by determining the State Share of Total Expenditures Claimed for all four quarters of the fiscal year minus State Share of IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments for all four quarters of the fiscal year, plus the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) fees for all four quarters of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(1) The State Share of Expenditures Claimed is: Total Expenditures Claimed for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter Adjustments minus the Federal Share of Total Expenditures Claimed for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter Adjustments claimed on the Form OCSE-396 for all four quarters of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(2) The State Share of IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments is: IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter Adjustments minus the Federal Share of IV-D Administrative Expenditures Made Using Funds Received as Incentive Payments for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter Adjustments claimed on the Form OCSE-396 for all four quarters of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(3) The Fees for the Use of the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) can be computed by adding the FPLS fees claimed on the Form OCSE-396 for all four quarters of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(f) Requests for approval of expending incentives on activities not currently eligible for funding under the IV-D program, but which would benefit the IV-D program, must be submitted in accordance with instructions issued by the Commissioner of the Office of Child Support Enforcement.</P>

            <P>(a) There are three performance measures for which States must achieve certain levels of performance in order to avoid being penalized for poor performance. These measures are the paternity establishment, support order establishment, and current collections measures set forth in § 305.2 of this part. The levels the State must meet are:<PRTPAGE P="296"/>

            <SUBJECT>Notice, corrective action year, and imposition of penalty.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If a State is found by the Secretary to be subject to a penalty as described in § 305.61, the OCSE will notify the State, in a record, of such finding.</P>
            <P>(b) The notice will:</P>

            <P>(2) Specify that the penalty will be assessed in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 262.1(b) through (e) and 262.7 if the State is found to have failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice during the automatic corrective action year (i.e., the succeeding fiscal year following the year with respect to which the deficiency occurred.)</P>
            <P>(c) The penalty under § 305.61 of this part will be assessed if the Secretary determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice by the end of the corrective action year.</P>
            <P>(d) Only one corrective action period is provided to a State with respect to a given deficiency where consecutive findings of noncompliance are made with respect to that deficiency. In the case of a State against which the penalty is assessed and which failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice by the end of the corrective action year, the penalty will be effective for any quarter after the end of the corrective action year and ends for the first full quarter throughout which the State IV-D program is determined to have corrected the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice.</P>
            <P>(e) A consecutive finding occurs only when the State does not meet the same criterion or criteria cited in the notice in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) A signed written agreement is reached between the noncustodial and custodial parent, which provides for an alternative arrangement, and is reviewed and entered into the record by the tribunal.</P>
              <P>(i) Where immediate income withholding is not in place, the income of the noncustodial parent shall become subject to withholding, at the earliest, on the date on which the payments which the noncustodial parent has failed to make under a Tribal support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month.</P>
              <P>(j) The only basis for contesting a withholding is a mistake of fact, which for purposes of this paragraph, means an error in the amount of current or overdue support or in the identity of the alleged noncustodial parent.</P>
              <P>(k) Tribal law must provide that the employer is subject to a fine to be determined under Tribal law for discharging a noncustodial parent from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against any noncustodial parent because of the withholding.</P>

              <P>(i) If a Tribe or Tribal organization anticipates that it will be temporarily unable to contribute part or all of the non-Federal share of funding under paragraph (d) of this section, it must submit a written request that this requirement be temporarily waived. A request for a waiver of part or all of the non-Federal share must be sent to ACF, included with the submission of SF 424A, no later than 60 days prior to the start of the funding period for which the waiver is being requested, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.

              <P>(ii) If, after the start of the funding period, an emergency situation such as a hurricane or flood occurs such that the grantee would need to request a waiver of the non-Federal costs, it may do so.

              <P>(v) A detailed description of the attempts made to secure the necessary funds and in-kind contributions from other sources and the results of those attempts, including copies of all relevant correspondence; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Any other documentation or other information that the Secretary may require to make this determination.</P>
              <P>(3) The Tribe or Tribal organization must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it temporarily lacks resources to provide the non-Federal share. In its request for a temporary waiver, the Tribe or Tribal organization must be able to demonstrate that it:</P>
              <P>(i) Lacks sufficient resources to provide the required non-Federal share of costs;</P>

              <P>(ii) Has made reasonable, but unsuccessful, efforts to obtain non-Federal share contributions; and<PRTPAGE P="333"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Has provided all required information requested by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(4) All statements in support of a waiver request must be supported by evidence including, but not limited to, a description of how the Tribe or Tribal organization's circumstances relate to its capacity to provide child support enforcement services. The following statements will be considered insufficient to merit a waiver under this section without documentary evidence satisfactory to the Secretary:</P>
              <P>(i) Funds have been committed to other budget items;</P>
              <P>(ii) A high rate of unemployment;</P>

              <P>(v) A small or declining tax base; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Little or no economic development.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) If approved, a temporary waiver submitted under either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section will expire on the last day of the funding period for which it was approved and is subject to review at any time during the funding period and may be revoked, if changing circumstances warrant.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unless the Tribe receives a written approval of its waiver request, the funding requirements stated in paragraph (d) of this section remain in effect.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the request for a waiver is denied, the denial is not subject to administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Increase in approved budget.</E> (1) A Tribe or Tribal organization may request an increase in the approved amount of its current budget by submitting a revised SF 424A to ACF and explaining why it needs the additional funds. The Tribe or Tribal organization should submit this request at least 60 days before additional funds are needed, to allow the Secretary adequate time to review the estimates and issue a revised grant award, if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) If the change in Tribal IV-D budget estimate results from a change in the Tribal IV-D plan, the Tribe or Tribal organization must submit a plan amendment in accordance with § 309.35(e) of this part, a revised SF 424 and a revised SF 424A with its request for additional funding. The effective date of a plan amendment may not be earlier than the first day of the fiscal quarter in which an approvable plan is submitted in accordance with § 309.35(f) of this part. The Secretary must approve the plan amendment before approving any additional funding.</P>
              <P>(3) Any approved increase in the Tribal IV-D budget will necessarily result in a proportional increase in the non-Federal share, unless a waiver of the non-Federal share has been granted.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Obtaining Federal funds.</E> Tribes and Tribal organizations will obtain Federal funds on a draw down basis from the Department's Payment Management System on a letter of credit system for payment of advances of Federal funds.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Grant administration requirements.</E> The provisions of part 75 of this title, establishing uniform administrative requirements and cost principles, shall apply to all grants made to Tribes and Tribal organizations under this part.</P>

                <P>(b) A State must certify no later than 30 days after the beginning of each Federal fiscal year that the approved State plan is current and continues in effect.

                <P>(a) Provide for the designation of, and describe the organization and functions of, a State agency (or agencies) responsible for developing the plan and administering, or supervising the administration of, the plan;</P>

                <P>(c) Describe how the State will ensure that language training and employment services are made available to refugees receiving cash assistance, and to other refugees, including State efforts to actively encourage refugee registration for employment services;</P>
                <P>(d) Identify an individual designated by the Governor or the appropriate legislative authority of the State, with the title of State Coordinator, who is employed by the State and will have the responsibility and authority to ensure coordination of public and private resources in refugee resettlement in the State;</P>

All existing exemptions to this requirement will expire 90 days after the effective date of this rule. Any State that wishes to be exempted from the provisions regarding the holding and frequency of meetings may apply by submitting a written request to the Director. The request must set forth the reasons why the State considers these meetings unnecessary because of the absence of problems associated with the planning and coordination of refugee placement. An approved exemption will remain in effect for three years, at which time a State may reapply.</P>
                <P>(i) Provide that the State will:</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Adverse determinations to which this procedure is applicable are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Termination, in whole or in part, of a grant for failure of the grantee to carry out its approved project or program in accordance with applicable law and the terms and conditions of such assistance or for failure of the grantee otherwise to comply with any law, regulation, assurance, term, or condition applicable to the grant.</P>

                <P>(2) A determination that an expenditure not allowable under the grant has been charged to the grant or that the grantee has otherwise failed to discharge its obligation to account for grant funds.<PRTPAGE P="354"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) The disapproval of a grantee's written request for permission to incur an expenditure during the term of a grant.</P>
                <P>(4) A determination that a grant is void because the award was obtained fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of adverse determination.</E> If the Director, or his or her designee, makes an adverse determination with respect to a grant, he or she shall promptly issue a notice of adverse determination to the State which contains the reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to enable the State agency to respond and informing the State agency of the opportunity for review under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Request for review of an adverse determination.</E> (1) If the State agency wants a review of the determination, it must submit a request for such review to the Director no later than 30 days after the postmark on the notice, unless an extension of time is granted for good cause.</P>
                <P>(2) The request for review must contain a full statement of the State's position with respect to the determination being appealed and the pertinent facts and reasons in support of such position. The State agency must attach to the submission a copy of the notice.</P>
                <P>(3) The Director may, at his or her discretion, invite the State to discuss pertinent issues and to submit such additional information as he or she deems appropriate.</P>
                <P>(4) Based on his or her review, the Director will send a written response to the State. If the response is adverse to the State's position, the correspondence shall state the State's right to appeal to the Departmental Grant Appeals Board, pursuant to part 16 of this title.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Request for appeal of an adverse determination.</E> (1) To appeal an adverse determination, a State agency must file an appeal with the Departmental Grant Appeals Board, in accordance with requirements contained in part 16 of this title.</P>
                <P>(2) The State's application for review must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the postmark on the Director's response to the State's request for review in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>

A State must continue to apply these rules to its RCA program until it implements a new RCA program under § 400.56 or § 400.65. A State that receives an approved waiver under § 400.300 to continue an AFDC-type RCA program must follow the rules in this section.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recovery of overpayments and correction of underpayments.</E> The State agency must comply with regulations at § 233.20(a)(13) of this title governing recovery of overpayments and correction of underpayments in the AFDC program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Opportunity to apply for cash assistance.</E> (1) A State must provide any individual wishing to do so, an opportunity to apply for cash assistance and must determine the eligibility of each applicant.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining eligibility for cash assistance, the State must—</P>
              <P>(i) Comply with the regulations at part 206 of this title governing applications, determinations of eligibility, and furnishing assistance under public assistance programs, as applicable to the AFDC program;</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine eligibility for other cash assistance programs in accordance with § 400.51; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Comply with regulations at §§ 400.54(a)(3) and 400.68.</P>

              <P>(1) Apply the regulations at § 233.20(a)(3) through (2) of this title for considering income and resources of AFDC applicants; and</P>
              <P>(2) Apply the regulations at § 400.66(b) through (d).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Need standards and payment levels.</E> (1) In determining need for refugee cash assistance, a State agency must use the State's AFDC need standards established under § 233.20(a)(1) and (2) of this title.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining the amount of the refugee cash assistance payment to an eligible refugee who meets the standards in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and applying the consideration of income and resources in paragraph (e) of this section and in § 400.66(b) through (d), a State must pay 100 percent of the payment level which would be appropriate for an eligible filing unit of the same size under the AFDC program.</P>
              <P>(3) The State agency may use the date of application as the date refugee cash assistance begins in order to provide payments quickly to newly arrived refugees.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Proration of shelter, utilities, and similar needs</E>—If a State prorated allowances for shelter, utilities, and similar needs in its AFDC program under § 233.20(a)(5) of this title, it must prorate such allowances in the same manner in its refugee assistance programs.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Other AFDC requirements applicable to refugee cash assistance</E>—In administering the program of refugee cash assistance, the State agency must also apply the following AFDC regulations in this title:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice and hearings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Timely and adequate notice.</E> (1) A written notice must be sent or provided to a recipient at least 10 days before the date upon which refugee cash assistance will be reduced, suspended, or terminated.</P>
              <P>(2) In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate that assistance has been authorized, denied, reduced, suspended, or terminated, the written notice must clearly state the action that will be taken, the reasons for the action, and the right to request a hearing.</P>

              <P>(3) In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate that assistance has been authorized, denied, reduced, suspended, or terminated, the State or its designee agency(s) must specify the program(s) to which the notice applies, clearly distinguishing between RCA and other assistance programs. For example, in the case of a publicly-administered program, if a refugee applies for assistance and is determined ineligible for TANF but eligible for refugee cash assistance, the notice to the applicant must specify clearly the determinations with respect both to TANF and to refugee cash assistance. When a recipient of refugee cash assistance is notified of termination because of reaching the time limit on such assistance, the State or its designee must review the case file to determine possible eligibility for TANF or GA due to changed circumstances and the notice to the recipient must indicate the result of that determination as well as the termination of RCA.<PRTPAGE P="359"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> All applicants for and recipients of refugee cash assistance must be provided an opportunity for a hearing to contest adverse determinations. States must ensure that hearings meet the due process standards in <E T="03">Goldberg</E> v. <E T="03">Kelly,</E> 397 U.S. 254 (1970).</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Public/private RCA programs.</E> The State must specify in the public/private RCA plan the hearing procedures to be used in the RCA program. The plan may specify that the local resettlement agency(s) will refer all hearing requests to a State-administered hearing process. If the plan does not specify the use of a State-administered hearing process, then the procedures to be followed must include:</P>
              <P>(i) The State or local resettlement agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA must provide an applicant for or recipient of refugee cash assistance an opportunity for an oral hearing to contest adverse determinations. Hearings must be conducted by an impartial official or designee of the State or local resettlement agency who has not been involved directly in the initial determination of the action in question.</P>
              <P>(ii) The State must ensure that procedures are established to provide refugees a right of final appeal for an in-person hearing provided by an impartial, independent entity outside of the local resettlement agency.</P>
              <P>(iii) Final administrative action must be taken within 60 days from the date of a request for a hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Publicly-administered RCA programs.</E> The State must specify in the State Plan referenced in § 400.4 the public agency hearing procedures it intends to use in the RCA program.</P>
              <P>(3) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, the written notice of any hearing determination must adequately explain the basis for the decision and the refugee's right to request any further administrative or judicial review.</P>
              <P>(4) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a refugee's benefits may not be terminated prior to completion of final administrative action, but are subject to recovery by the agency if the action is sustained.</P>
              <P>(5) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a hearing need not be granted when Federal law requires automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is an incorrect grant computation.</P>
              <P>(6) In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a hearing need not be granted when assistance is terminated because the eligibility time period imposed by law has been reached, unless there is a disputed issue of fact that is unresolved by the process in § 400.23.</P>

              <P>A State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA, must make available to refugees the written policies of the RCA program, including agency policies regarding eligibility standards, the duration and amount of cash assistance payments, the requirements for participation in services, the penalties for non-cooperation, and client rights and responsibilities to ensure that refugees understand what they are eligible for, what is expected of them, and what protections are available to them. The State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA, must ensure that agency policy materials and all notices required in §§ 400.54, 400.82, and 400.83, are made available in written form in English and in appropriate languages where a significant number or proportion of the recipient population needs information in a particular language. In regard to refugee language groups that constitute a small number or proportion of the recipient population, the State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA, at a minimum, must use an alternative method, such as verbal translation in the refugee's native language, to ensure that the content of the agency's policies is effectively communicated to each refugee.</P>

              <P>(2) States that elect to exceed monthly payment ceilings in order to provide employment incentives must budget their resources to ensure that sufficient RCA funds are available to cover a refugee's cash assistance needs in the latter months of a refugee's eligibility period, if needed.</P>

              <P>(d) If the Director determines that the payment ceilings need to be adjusted for inflation, the Director will publish a document in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing the new payment ceilings.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Criteria for appropriate employability services and employment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The State agency or its designee must determine if employability services and employment are appropriate in accordance with the following criteria:</P>

                <P>(a) The services or employment must meet the following criteria, or, if approved by the Director, the comparable <PRTPAGE P="366"/>criteria applied by the State in an alternative program for TANF recipients:</P>
                <P>(1) All assignments must be within the scope of the individual's employability plan. The plan may be modified to reflect changed services or employment conditions.</P>
                <P>(2) The services or employment must be related to the capability of the individual to perform the task on a regular basis. Any claim of adverse effect on physical or mental health must be based on adequate medical testimony from a physician or licensed or certified psychologist indicating that participation would impair the individual's physical or mental health.</P>
                <P>(3) The total daily commuting time to and from home to the service or employment site must not normally exceed 2 hours, not including the transporting of a child to and from a child care facility, unless a longer commuting distance or time is generally accepted in the community, in which case the round trip commuting time must not exceed the generally accepted community standards.</P>
                <P>(4) When child care is required, the care must meet the standards normally required by the State in its work and training programs for TANF recipients.</P>
                <P>(5) The service or work site to which the individual is assigned must not be in violation of applicable Federal, State, or local health and safety standards.</P>
                <P>(6) Assignments must not be made which are discriminatory in terms of age, sex, race, creed, color, or national origin.</P>
                <P>(7) Appropriate work may be temporary, permanent, full-time, part-time, or seasonal work if such work meets the other standards of this section.</P>
                <P>(8) The wage shall meet or exceed the Federal or State minimum wage law, whichever is applicable, or if such laws are not applicable, the wage shall not be substantially less favorable than the wage normally paid for similar work in that labor market.</P>
                <P>(9) The daily hours of work and the weekly hours of work shall not exceed those customary to the occupation. And</P>
                <P>(10) No individual may be required to accept employment if:</P>
                <P>(i) The position offered is vacant due to a strike, lockout, or other bona fide labor dispute; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The individual would be required to work for an employer contrary to the conditions of his existing membership in the union governing that occupation. However, employment not governed by the rules of a union in which he or she has membership may be deemed appropriate.</P>
                <P>(11) In addition to meeting the other criteria of this paragraph, the quality of training must meet local employers' requirements so that the individual will be in a competitive position within the local labor market. The training must also be likely to lead to employment which will meet the appropriate work criteria.</P>
                <P>(b) If an individual is a professional in need of professional refresher training and other recertification services in order to qualify to practice his or her profession in the United States, the training may consist of full-time attendance in a college or professional training program, provided that such training: Is approved as part of the individual's employability plan by the State agency, or its designee; does not exceed one year's duration (including any time enrolled in such program in the United States prior to the refugee's application for assistance); is specifically intended to assist the professional in becoming relicensed in his or her profession; and, if completed, can realistically be expected to result in such relicensing. This training may only be made available to individuals who are employed.</P>

                <P>(c) A job offered, if determined appropriate under the requirements of this subpart, is required to be accepted by the refugee without regard to whether such job would interrupt a program of services planned or in progress unless the refugee is currently participating in a program <E T="03">in progress</E> of on-the-job training (as described in § 400.154(c)) or vocational training (as described in § 400.154(e)) which meets the requirements of this part and which is being <PRTPAGE P="367"/>carried out as part of an approved employability plan.</P>

              <P>(c) Unaccompanied minors are not generally eligible for adoption since family reunification is the objective of the program. In certain rare cases, adoption may be permitted pursuant to adoption laws in the State of resettlement, provided a court finds that: (1) Adoption would be in the best interest of the child; and (2) there is termination of parental rights (for example, in situations where the parents are dead or are missing and presumed dead) as determined by the appropriate State court. When adoption occurs, the child's status as an unaccompanied minor terminates.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Methodology to be used to determine time-eligibility of refugees.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The time-eligibility period for refugee cash assistance and refugee medical assistance will be determined by the Director each year, based on appropriated funds available for the fiscal year. The Director will make a determination of the eligibility period each year as soon as possible after funds are appropriated for the refugee program, and also at subsequent points during the fiscal year, only if a reduction in the eligibility period is indicated, based on updated information on refugee flows and State reports on receipt of assistance and expenditures. The method to be used to determine the RCA/RMA eligibility period will include the following steps and will be applied to various RCA/RMA time-eligibility periods in order to determine the time-eligibility period which will provide the most number of months without incurring a shortfall in funds for the fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(1) The time-eligibility population for the projected fiscal year will be estimated on the basis of the refugee admissions ceiling established by the President for that fiscal year and the anticipated arrival of other persons eligible for refugee assistance, to the extent that data on these persons are available. The anticipated pattern of refugee flow for the projected fiscal year will be estimated based on the best available historical and current refugee flow information that will most accurately forecast the refugee flow for the projected fiscal year. These arrival figures will then be used to determine the time-eligible population for a given duration of RCA/RMA benefits.</P>
                <P>(2) The average annual number of RCA and RMA recipients will be determined by multiplying the estimated time-eligible population established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the estimated RCA and RMA participation rates. The RMA participation rate will take into account both RCA recipients, who are also eligible for RMA, and RMA-only recipients. Recipient data from quarterly performance reports submitted by States for the most recent 4 quarters for which reports are available will be used to determine the appropriate participation rates for various RCA/RMA time-eligibility periods.</P>
                <P>(3) The average annual per recipient cost for RCA and RMA will be estimated separately, based on estimated per recipient costs for the most recent fiscal year, using available data, and inflated for the projected fiscal year using projected increases in per capita cash assistance costs for RCA and per capita Medicaid costs for RMA.</P>
                <P>(4) The expected average number of RCA recipients will be multiplied by the expected RCA per recipient cost to derive estimated RCA costs. The expected average annual number of RMA recipients will be multiplied by the expected RMA per recipient cost to derive estimated RMA costs.</P>
                <P>(5) State administrative costs for the projected fiscal year for all States in the aggregate will be estimated based on total actual allowable expenditures for State administration for the most recent fiscal year. The variable portion of administrative costs will be adjusted for changes in program participation and inflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items as estimated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The fixed portion of administrative costs will be adjusted by the CPI inflator only.</P>
                <P>(6) The total estimated costs for the projected fiscal year will equal the combined estimated costs for RCA, RMA, and State administration as calculated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.</P>

                <P>(b) If, as the Director determines, the period of eligibility needs to be changed from the eligibility period in effect at the time, the Director will publish a final notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> announcing the new period of eligibility for refugee cash assistance and refugee medical assistance and the effective date for implementing the new eligibility period. States will be given as much notice as available funds will allow without resulting in a further reduction in the eligibility period. At a minimum, States will be given 30 days' notice.</P>

              <P>If a State wishes to apply for a waiver of a requirement of this part, the Director may waive such requirement with respect to such State, unless required by statute, if the Director determines that such waiver will advance the purposes of this part and is appropriate and consistent with Federal refugee policy objectives. To the fullest extent practicable, the Director will approve or disapprove an application for a waiver within 130 days of receipt of such application. The Director shall provide timely written notice of the reasons for denial to States whose applications are disapproved.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withdrawal from the refugee program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In the event that a State decides to cease participation in the refugee program, the State must provide 120 days advance notice to the Director before withdrawing from the program.</P>
              <P>(b) To participate in the refugee program, a State is expected to operate all components of the refugee program, including refugee cash and medical assistance, social services, preventive health, and an unaccompanied minors program if appropriate. A State is also expected to play a coordinating role in the provision of assistance and services in accordance with § 400.5(b). In the event that a State wishes to retain responsibility for only part of the refugee program, it must obtain prior approval from the Director of ORR. Such approval will be granted if it is in the best interest of the Government.</P>
              <P>(c) When a State withdraws from all or part of the refugee program, the Director may authorize a replacement designee or designees to administer the provision of assistance and services, as appropriate, to refugees in that State. A replacement designee must adhere to the same regulations under this part that apply to a State-administered program, with the exception of the following provisions: 45 CFR 400.5(d), 400.7, 400.51(b)(2)(i), 400.58(c), 400.94(a), 400.94(b), 400.94(c), and subpart L. Replacement designees must also adhere to the Subpart L regulations regarding formula allocation grants for targeted assistance, if the State authorized the replacement designee appointed by the Director to act as its agent in applying for and receiving targeted assistance funds. Certain provisions are excepted because they apply only to States and become moot when a State withdraws from participation in the refugee program and is replaced by another entity. States would continue to be responsible for administering the other excepted provisions because these provisions refer to the administration of other State-run public assistance programs.</P>

A State may use welfare data as an additional factor in the allocation of targeted assistance funds if it so chooses; however, a State may not assign a greater weight to welfare data than it has assigned to population data in its allocation formula.</P>
                <P>(b) A State must assure that not less than 95 percent of the total award to the State is made available to the qualified county or counties, except in those cases where the qualified county or counties have agreed to let the State administer the targeted assistance program in the county's stead.</P>

              <P>(a) These regulations implement section 204 of Pub. L. 99-603, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), as amended. This act establishes a temporary program of State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants (SLIAG) for States.

              <P>(b) Funds appropriated by section 204 may be applied by States with approved applications to certain State and local government costs incurred:</P>
              <P>(1) In providing public assistance and public health assistance to eligible legalized aliens,</P>
              <P>(2) For making payments to State educational agencies for the purpose of assisting local educational agencies in providing certain educational services to eligible legalized aliens,</P>

              <P>(c)(1) For public assistance, States may establish allowability by accounting for actual expenditures made to or on behalf of identifiable eligible legalized aliens who qualify for and receive assistance and/or services from the recipient, or by use of a statistically valid sampling of a recipient's public assistance caseload.</P>
              <P>(2) For public health assistance, States may establish allowability by accounting for actual expenditures made to or on behalf of identifiable eligible legalized aliens, or applicants for lawful temporary resident status under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA, who qualify for and receive such assistance and/or services, by use of a statistically valid sampling of clients in the public health system of the State or local government, or by using the ratio of eligible legalized aliens in a service population to all members of the relevant service population.</P>

              <P>(4) With respect to Phase II outreach, as defined in this part, a State must demonstrate that the costs of activities that provide information directly to specific individuals are attributable only to lawful temporary residents under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA, and applicants for such status whose applications were pending with the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time information is provided. For Phase II outreach activities <PRTPAGE P="389"/>that do not involve the provision of information directly to specific individuals, States must demonstrate that such activities are targeted predominantly to or intended primarily for lawful temporary residents under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA or applicants for such status whose applications are pending with the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time information is provided. The State must demonstrate that the amount of any fiscal year's allotment used for this purpose did not exceed the amount described in § 402.11(k) and was consistent with the limitations of § 402.11(i).</P>
              <P>(5) With respect to employment discrimination education and outreach, as defined in this part, the State must demonstrate that funds were expended only for activities described in the State's approved application pursuant to § 402.41(d) and the limitations of § 402.11 (i), (n), and (o) and that the amount of any fiscal year's allotment used for this purpose did not exceed the amount described in § 402.11(1).</P>
              <P>(6)(i) For program administrative costs, as defined in this part, a State may establish allowability by use of the proportion of eligible legalized aliens provided assistance and/or services allowable under this part by a recipient, as defined in this part, relative to all persons provided such assistance and/or services; by use of the proportion of program or service costs actually incurred in providing assistance and/or services allowable under this part by a recipient, relative to all costs of providing the same assistance and/or services allowable under this part by the recipient; or by use of such other basis as will document that administrative costs incurred in providing such assistance and/or services and reimbursed under this part are allowable, allocable to SLIAG, and reasonable.</P>
              <P>(ii) Consistent with section 604 of the Emergency Immigrant Education Act, of the amount paid to a State educational agency for educational services, only 1.5 percent may be used for administrative costs incurred by the State educational agency in carrying out its function under this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Considerations generally applicable to the placement of an unaccompanied alien child.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) ORR places each UAC in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child and appropriate to the UAC's age and special needs, provided that such setting is consistent with its interests to ensure the UAC's timely appearance before DHS and the immigration courts and to protect the UAC's well-being and that of others.</P>
              <P>(b) ORR separates UACs from delinquent offenders.</P>
              <P>(c) ORR makes reasonable efforts to provide placements in those geographical areas where DHS apprehends the majority of UAC.</P>
              <P>(d) Facilities where ORR places UACs will provide access to toilets and sinks, drinking water and food as appropriate, medical assistance if a UAC is in need of emergency services, adequate temperature control and ventilation, adequate supervision to protect UAC from others, and contact with family members who were arrested with the minor.</P>
              <P>(e) If there is no appropriate licensed program immediately available for placement of a UAC pursuant to this subpart, and no one to whom ORR may release the UAC pursuant to subpart C of this part, the UAC may be placed in an ORR-contracted facility, having separate accommodations for minors, or a State or county juvenile detention facility. In addition to the requirement that UACs shall be separated from delinquent offenders, every effort must be taken to ensure that the safety and well-being of the UAC detained in these facilities are satisfactorily provided for by the staff. ORR makes all reasonable efforts to place each UAC in a licensed program as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(f) ORR makes and records the prompt and continuous efforts on its part toward family reunification. ORR continues such efforts at family reunification for as long as the minor is in ORR custody.</P>

              <P>(a) Notwithstanding § 410.202, ORR may place a UAC in a secure facility if the UAC:</P>
              <P>(1) Has been charged with, is chargeable, or has been convicted of a crime, or is the subject of delinquency proceedings, has been adjudicated delinquent, or is chargeable with a delinquent act, and where ORR deems those circumstances demonstrate that the UAC poses a danger to self or others. “Chargeable” means that ORR has probable cause to believe that the UAC has committed a specified offense. The provision in this paragraph (a)(1) does not apply to a UAC whose offense is:</P>
              <P>(i) An isolated offense that was not within a pattern or practice of criminal activity and did not involve violence against a person or the use or carrying of a weapon; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A petty offense, which is not considered grounds for stricter means of detention in any case;</P>
              <P>(2) While in DHS or ORR's custody or while in the presence of an immigration officer, has committed, or has made credible threats to commit, a violent or malicious act (whether directed at himself/herself or others);</P>

              <P>(3) Has engaged, while in a licensed program or staff secure facility, in conduct that has proven to be unacceptably disruptive of the normal functioning of the licensed program or staff secure facility in which he or she has been placed and removal is necessary to ensure the welfare of the UAC or others, as determined by the staff of the licensed program or staff secure facility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> drug or alcohol abuse, stealing, fighting, intimidation of others, or sexually predatory behavior), and ORR determines the UAC poses a danger to self or others based on such conduct;</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of placement in a secure residential treatment centers (RTC), if a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist determines that the UAC poses a risk of harm to self or others; or</P>
              <P>(5) Is otherwise a danger to self or others.</P>
              <P>(b) ORR Federal Field Specialists review and approve all placements of UAC in secure facilities consistent with legal requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) ORR reviews, at least monthly, the placement of a UAC into a secure, staff secure, or RTC facility to determine whether a new level of care is more appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding ORR's ability under the rules in this subpart to place UACs who are “otherwise a danger to self or others” in secure placements, the provision in this section does not abrogate any requirements to place UACs in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their age and special needs.</P>

              <P>A UAC who is placed in a licensed program pursuant to this subpart remains in the custody of ORR, and may only be transferred or released under its authority. However, in the event of an emergency, a licensed program may transfer temporarily the physical placement of a UAC prior to securing permission from ORR, but must notify ORR of the transfer as soon as possible, but in all cases within eight hours of the transfer.

              <SUBJECT>Procedures during an emergency or influx.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In the event of an emergency or influx that prevents the prompt placement of UAC in licensed programs, ORR makes all reasonable efforts to place each UAC in a licensed program as expeditiously as possible using the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(a) ORR maintains an emergency placement list of at least 80 beds at programs licensed by an appropriate state agency that are potentially available to accept emergency placements.</P>
              <P>(b) ORR implements its contingency plan on emergencies and influxes.</P>
              <P>(c) Within one business day of the emergency or influx, ORR, if necessary, contacts the programs on the emergency placement list to determine available placements. To the extent practicable, ORR will attempt to locate emergency placements in geographic areas where culturally and linguistically appropriate community services are available.</P>
              <P>(d) In the event that the number of UAC needing placement exceeds the available appropriate placements on the emergency placement list, ORR works with governmental and nongovernmental organizations to locate additional placements through licensed programs, county social services departments, and foster family agencies.</P>
              <P>(e) ORR maintains a list of UACs affected by the emergency or influx including each UAC's:</P>
              <P>(1) Name;</P>
              <P>(2) Date and country of birth;</P>
              <P>(3) Date of placement in ORR's custody; and</P>
              <P>(4) Place and date of current placement.</P>
              <P>(f) Each year ORR reevaluates the number of regular placements needed for UAC to determine whether the number of regular placements should be adjusted to accommodate an increased or decreased number of UAC eligible for placement in licensed programs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sponsors to whom ORR releases an unaccompanied alien child.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) ORR releases a UAC to an approved sponsor without unnecessary delay, but may continue to retain custody of a UAC if ORR determines that continued custody is necessary to ensure the UAC's safety or the safety of others, or that continued custody is required to secure the UAC's timely appearance before DHS or the immigration courts.</P>
              <P>(b) When ORR releases a UAC without unnecessary delay to an approved sponsor, it releases in the following order of preference:</P>
              <P>(1) A parent;</P>
              <P>(2) A legal guardian;</P>
              <P>(3) An adult relative (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, or grandparent);</P>

              <P>(4) An adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian <PRTPAGE P="400"/>as capable and willing to care for the UAC's well-being in:</P>
              <P>(i) A declaration signed under penalty of perjury before an immigration or consular officer; or</P>

              <P>(a) The licensed program providing care for the UAC shall make and record the prompt and continuous efforts on its part towards family reunification and the release of the UAC pursuant to the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) ORR requires a background check, including verification of identity and which may include verification of employment of the individuals offering support, prior to release.</P>
              <P>(c) ORR also may require further suitability assessment, which may include interviews of members of the household, investigation of the living conditions in which the UAC would be placed and the standard of care he or she would receive, a home visit, a fingerprint-based background and criminal records check on the prospective sponsor and on adult residents of the prospective sponsor's household, and follow-up visits after release. Any such assessment also takes into consideration the wishes and concerns of the UAC.</P>
              <P>(d) If the conditions identified in TVPRA at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(3)(B) are met, and require a home study, no release to a sponsor may occur in the absence of such a home study.</P>
              <P>(e) The proposed sponsor must sign an affidavit of support and a custodial release agreement of the conditions of release. The custodial release agreement requires that the sponsor:</P>
              <P>(1) Provide for the UAC's physical, mental, and financial well-being;</P>
              <P>(2) Ensure the UAC's presence at all future proceedings before DHS and the immigration courts;</P>
              <P>(3) Ensure the UAC reports for removal from the United States if so ordered;</P>
              <P>(4) Notify ORR, DHS, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review of any change of address within five days following a move;</P>

              <P>(7) Receive written permission from ORR if the sponsor decides to transfer legal custody of the UAC to someone else. Also, in the event of an emergency (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> serious illness or destruction of the home), a sponsor may transfer temporary physical custody of the UAC prior to securing permission from ORR, but the sponsor must notify ORR as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours after the transfer; and</P>
              <P>(8) Notify ORR and DHS as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours of learning that the UAC has disappeared, has been threatened, or has been contacted in any way by an individual or individuals believed to represent an immigrant smuggling syndicate or organized crime.</P>
              <P>(f) ORR is not required to release a UAC to any person or agency it has reason to believe may harm or neglect the UAC or fail to present him or her before DHS or the immigration courts when requested to do so.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conducting age determinations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Procedures for determining the age of an individual must take into account the totality of the circumstances and evidence, including the non-exclusive use of radiographs, to determine the age of the individual. ORR may require an individual in ORR's custody to submit to a medical or dental examination conducted by a medical professional or to submit to other appropriate procedures to verify his or her age. If ORR subsequently determines that such an individual is a UAC, he or she will be treated in accordance with ORR's UAC regulations in this part for all purposes.</P>

              <P>If, the procedures in § 410.700 would result in a reasonable person concluding that an individual is an adult, despite his or her claim to be under the age of 18, ORR must treat such person as an adult for all purposes.</P>

              <P>(a) For UACs not placed in licensed programs, ORR shall—within a reasonable period of time—provide a notice of the reasons for housing the minor in secure or staff secure facility. Such notice shall be in a language the UAC understands.</P>
              <P>(b) ORR shall promptly provide each UAC not released with:</P>
              <P>(1) A list of free legal services providers compiled by ORR and that is provided to UAC as part of a Legal Resource Guide for UAC (unless previously given to the UAC); and</P>

              <P>(2) The following explanation of the right of potential review:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“ORR usually houses persons under the age of 18 in an open setting, such as a foster or group home, and not in detention facilities. If you believe that you have not been properly placed or that you have been treated improperly, you may call a lawyer to seek assistance. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may call one from the list of free legal services given to you with this form.”</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 410.810</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A UAC may request that an independent hearing officer employed by HHS determine, through a written decision, whether the UAC would present a risk of danger to the community or risk of flight if released.</P>
              <P>(1) Requests under this section may be made by the UAC, his or her legal representative, or his or her parent or legal guardian.</P>

              <P>(2) UACs placed in secure or staff secure facilities will receive a notice of the procedures under this section and may use a form provided to them to <PRTPAGE P="404"/>make a written request for a hearing under this section.</P>
              <P>(b) In hearings conducted under this section, HHS bears the initial burden of production to support its determination that a UAC would pose a danger or flight risk if discharged from HHS' care and custody. The burden of persuasion is then on the UAC to show that he or she will not be a danger to the community or flight risk if released, using a preponderance of the evidence standard.</P>
              <P>(c) In hearings under this section, the UAC may be represented by a person of his or her choosing, at no cost to the government. The UAC may present oral and written evidence to the hearing officer and may appear by video or teleconference. ORR may also choose to present evidence either in writing, or by appearing in person, or by video or teleconference.</P>
              <P>(d) A hearing officer's decision that a UAC would not be a danger to the community (or risk of flight) if released is binding upon ORR, unless the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(e) A hearing officer's decision under this section may be appealed to the Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families. Any such appeal request shall be in writing, and must be received within 30 days of the hearing officer decision. The Assistant Secretary will reverse a hearing officer decision only if there is a clear error of fact, or if the decision includes an error of law. Appeal to the Assistant Secretary shall not affect a stay of the hearing officer's decision to release the UAC, unless within five business days of such hearing officer decision, the Assistant Secretary issues a decision in writing that release of the UAC would result in a significant danger to the community. Such a stay decision must include a description of behaviors of the UAC while in care and/or documented criminal or juvenile behavior records from the UAC demonstrating that the UAC would present a danger to community if released.</P>
              <P>(f) Decisions under this section are final and binding on the Department, and a UAC may only seek another hearing under this section if the UAC can demonstrate a material change in circumstances. Similarly, ORR may request the hearing officer to make a new determination under this section if at least one month has passed since the original decision, and ORR can show that a material change in circumstances means the UAC should no longer be released.</P>
              <P>(g) This section cannot be used to determine whether a UAC has a suitable sponsor, and neither the hearing officer nor the Assistant Secretary may order the UAC released.</P>
              <P>(h) This section may not be invoked to determine the UAC's placement while in HHS custody. Nor may this section be invoked to determine level of custody for the UAC.</P>

Traditional foster care homes are not subject to this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Emergency care provider facilities are subject to every section in this part except:</P>
              <P>(1) Section 411.22(c);</P>

              <P>(c) Emergency care provider facilities must implement the standards in this rule, excluding the standards listed above, within fifteen (15) days of opening. The Director, however, may, using unreviewable discretion, waive or modify specific sections for a particular emergency care provider facility for good cause. Good cause would only be found in cases where the temporary nature of the emergency care provider facility makes compliance with the provision impracticable or impossible, and the Director determines that the emergency care provider facility could not, without substantial difficulty, meet the provision in the absence of the waiver or modification.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purposes of this part, the terms related to sexual abuse and sexual harassment refer specifically to the sexual abuse or sexual harassment of a UC that occurs at an ORR care provider facility while in ORR care and custody. Incidents of past sexual abuse or sexual harassment or sexual abuse or sexual harassment that occurs in any other context other than in ORR care and custody are not within the scope of this regulation.</P>

              <P>(a) Within 72 hours of a UC's arrival at a care provider facility and periodically throughout a UC's stay, the care provider facility must obtain and use information about each UC's personal history and behavior using a standardized screening instrument to reduce the risk of sexual abuse or sexual harassment by or upon a UC.</P>
              <P>(b) The care provider facility must consider, at a minimum and to the extent that the information is available, the following criteria to assess UCs for risk of sexual victimization:</P>
              <P>(1) Prior sexual victimization or abusiveness;</P>
              <P>(2) Any gender nonconforming appearance or manner or Self-identification as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or intersex and whether the resident may therefore be vulnerable to sexual abuse or sexual harassment;</P>

              <P>(6) Level of emotional and cognitive development;</P>
              <P>(7) Physical size and stature;</P>
              <P>(8) The UC's own perception of vulnerability; and</P>

              <P>(9) Any other specific information about an individual UC that may indicate heightened needs for supervision, <PRTPAGE P="415"/>additional safety precautions, or separation from certain other UCs.</P>
              <P>(c) This information must be ascertained through conversations with the UC during the intake process and medical and mental health screenings; during classification assessments; and by reviewing court records, case files, care provider facility behavioral records, and other relevant documentation from the UC's files. Only trained staff are permitted to talk with UCs to gather information about their sexual orientation or gender identity, prior sexual victimization, history of engaging in sexual abuse, mental health status, and mental disabilities for the purposes of the assessment required under paragraph (a) of this section. Care provider facilities must provide UCs an opportunity to discuss any safety concerns or sensitive issues privately.</P>
              <P>(d) The care provider facility must implement appropriate controls on the dissemination within the care provider facility of responses to questions asked pursuant to this standard in order to ensure that sensitive information is not exploited to the UC's detriment by staff or other UCs.</P>

              <P>(a) The care provider facility must use the information from the risk assessment under § 411.41 to inform assignment of UCs to housing, education, recreation, and other activities and services. The care provider facility must make individualized determinations about how to ensure the safety and health of each UC.</P>
              <P>(b) Care provider facilities may not place UCs on one-on-one supervision as a result of the assessment completed in § 411.41 unless there are exigent circumstances that require one-on-one supervision to keep the UC, other UCs, or staff safe, and then, only until an alternative means of keeping all residents and staff safe can be arranged. During any period of one-on-one supervision, a UC may not be denied any required services, including but not limited to daily large-muscle exercise, required educational programming, and social services, as reasonable under the circumstances. UCs on one-on-one supervision must receive daily visits from a medical practitioner or mental health care clinician as necessary unless the medical practitioner or mental health care clinician determines daily visits are not required. The medical practitioner or mental health care clinician, however, must continue to meet with the UC on a regular basis while the UC is on one-on-one supervision.</P>
              <P>(c) When making assessment and housing assignments for a transgender or intersex UCs, the care provider facility must consider the UC's gender self-identification and an assessment of the effects of a housing assignment on the UC's health and safety. The care provider facility must consult a medical or mental health professional as soon as practicable on this assessment. The care provider facility must not base housing assignment decisions of transgender or intersex UCs solely on the identity documents or physical anatomy of the UC; a UC's self-identification of his/her gender and self-assessment of safety needs must always be taken into consideration as well. An identity document may include but is not limited to official U.S. and foreign government documentation, birth certificates, and other official documentation stating the UC's sex. The care provider facility's housing assignment of a transgender or intersex UCs must be consistent with the safety and security considerations of the care provider facility, State and local licensing standards, and housing and programming assignments of each transgender or intersex UCs must be regularly reassessed to review any threats to safety experienced by the UC.</P>

              <P>(c) A UC victim may be placed on one-on-one supervision in order to protect the UC in exigent circumstances. Before taking the UC off of one-on-one supervision, the care provider facility must complete a re-assessment taking into consideration any increased vulnerability of the UC as a result of the sexual abuse or sexual harassment. The re-assessment must be completed as soon as possible and without delay so that the UC is not on one-on-one supervision longer than is absolutely necessary for safety and security reasons.</P>
